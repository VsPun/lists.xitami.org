In the FAQ:
44: In FTP, 'ls' fails from a remote system (it works locally)

This is probably due to the remote machine being hidden by a router or
firewall which prevents return connections from the FTP server to the
client. You should use passive mode for such connections. The next release
of Xitami handles this situation better, but the basic problem is
unsolvable; if the client is behind a firewall or router that does not allow
reverse connections (i.e. server to client) then the default FTP protocol
does not work correctly.

Is it possible to run Xitami from a CD-ROM without installation?

I'm trying to create a full functionality site with some form of CGI (or 
PHP or Java etc) programs
on the CD-ROM. Eg. The web site on the CD-ROM can have a database to store 
the content and
a "search engine".

Thanks
YekSoon

In theory it should be possible to run Xitami from a CD-ROM directly,
although you'd have to configure it to save its log files, etc,
somewhere else.  Basically Xitami looks for stuff in its own directory
(typically the current directory when it starts up), and so you should
be able to configure most things relative to wherever it happens to be.

The tricky thing would be ensuring that Xitami was started from the
right direction (irrespective of where the CD is mounted, drive letters,
etc).

I don't know of anyone whose done it, but it doesn't sound _too_
difficult to do to me.

I have seen programs that did exactly that in the past.  They where on the 
now defunct winfiles site.  Might be able to find them on ZDNET now.
They compiled your site in to a single exec file with seach.

Has it made it to the top of this list yet?

I writing a article for Circuit Cellar Online about State Machine and I 
wanted to mention OpenKerenel, Xitami, Liberao, et. al. but saying "it is 
impossible to build from the current cvs" doesn't seem like a good thing, so 
will probably just not mention them at all.

For any one that wonders what that means:

The tools where build incrementally as the code progressed, regenerating new 
tools.  cvs has reached the point where it is impossible to build the cvs 
tree because you need the latests tools, that you can only get and build from 
cvs.  :-(

There needs to be some kind of boot strapping procedure when you are starting 
off on a clean system (no tools other than the basics like GCC et.al.).

Not really, no.  People keep coming along and wanting to pay us money to
do things.  How can we refuse?  :-)

Libero in particular is basically stable; the version on the iMatix
website is essentially the same as in CVS, and builds fine with just a
compiler.  Please mention it in the stuff about state machines; it's a
very useful tool.  (Indeed libero was what first attracted me to
iMatix.)

SFL can be built from CVS.  The rest of Open Kernel _can_ be built from
the combination of CVS and what is on the website (someone challenged me
to do it, and I proved it could still be done: the major trick is that
you have to build two versions of SFL (one from the website and one from
CVS), and two versions of GSL (again the one on the website and the one
in CVS) to get through the process.  Once you've done it once, you've
got all the right tools, and it's fine).

Indeed.  Alas so many things depend on GSL now (including SMT), and the
current version of GSL depends on SMT.  So building from scratch
directly from CVS is currently a little tricky.

When ready-to-compile packages are generated for the website obviously
they'll include all the generated files, which neatly side steps this
problem.

However the circular build dependencies are causing problems internally
too, so they are definitely being worked on as time permits.
