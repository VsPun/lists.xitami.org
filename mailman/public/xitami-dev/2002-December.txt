Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Isapid. I cannot get upload to PHP  to work.
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021201153719.030828e8@mail.brd.com>

Hi folks:

I wonder what to do. I am running ISAPID with xitami and it works great
running the PHP4ISAPI.dll module.

Except  that I cannot get it to upload a file. Xitami with plain PHP.EXE works
fine, but when I try to use ISAPID.EXE I get gibberish instead of the 
uploaded file.

Anything I can do to correct the problem? I use forms that are
multipart/form data. The rest of the fields except the uploaded file come
OK.

Regards,

George
