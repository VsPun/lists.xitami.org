</I>
For the &quot;diehard fans only&quot;, they can get it from CVS.  ViewCVS will let
you look at what is there:

<A HREF="http://cvs.imatix.com./cgi-bin/viewcvs/">http://cvs.imatix.com./cgi-bin/viewcvs/</A>

Our public CVS archive is in the middle of a rearrangement at present,
so it's a bit messy (eg, there are multiple names for many things: the
shorter ones are the newer ones).

The modules you need are &quot;sfl&quot;, &quot;smt&quot;, and &quot;gsl&quot;.  The GSL there is GSL3.

There are brief details on how to get a (read only) copy from CVS on
that webpage, as well as the ability to navigate the archive.

&gt;<i>Also from the postings it appears that GSLgen is not meant to be used
</I>&gt;<i>for dynamic HTML generation. What would you suggest for XML-&gt; HTML ? There
</I>&gt;<i>are many XSLT but XSL is not as easy to learn as GSL and less powerful 
</I>&gt;<i>than GSL (IMHO). Any suggestions?
</I>
Personally I'd tend to use GSL for dynamic XML -&gt; HTML conversion for
relatively small things; and I'd tend to avoid on-the-fly conversion of
anything large (irrespective of technology) because it takes too long.
GSL3 in the Xitami in CVS is somewhat better for on-the-fly conversion
because it's a SMT-agent itself, and so can be multithreaded with other
things.  (The GSL2 in Xitami 2.5b5 has to run to completion before
anything else can be done.)  (Note however that the GSL3/Xitami
interface is still in a state of flux and not entirely debugged.)

As you say XSLT is more difficult to learn than GSL, and from what I've
seen to date, not really any faster to write/use than GSL.  So I don't
think there's all that much advantage in learning it just to do dynamic
XML-&gt;HTML conversions if you already know GSL.
