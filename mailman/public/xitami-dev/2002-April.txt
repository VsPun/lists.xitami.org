I assume you're talking about at the signon phase. 

In LRWP1.0 the response would be ERROR (IIRC), with no terminator.

In LRWP2.0 as far as I recall the idea was that it'd send REJECTED, a
terminator character (0xFF), and then an error message, and then another
terminator.

There's no fixed length blocks (those are just buffers in the program,
and not all of them will be sent if they're not needed).

>it no delimiter was found i can fetch another 1024 byte block.
>can i rely on 1024 byte sized buffers ?

>From a receiving point of view, you need to keep receiving (in LRWP2.0)
until you've received the two terminators, and then extract the error
message.  If you don't want the error message you can just close the
connection of course.

Reading (with Java, I'm guessing) into 1024-byte buffers should be okay;
it should return you what is available, and you can then check to see if
it's complete or not.

FWIW, the iMatix ServletRunner (0.3 beta) has Java implementation code 
to handle this (LRWP_2_0_WebServerConnection.java) which AFAIK will work.  
You might want to at least look through what that does to understand how
the protocol is handled.

I don't actually recall when that FAQ entry was written, so I don't know
which "next release" it is referring to.  You could try 2.4d9 and 2.5b5
and see if they solve your problem, but I suspect that at least some of
the situation will remain.

FTP is just basically a very troublesome protocol when one or more
routers/firewalls are involved.

The Pro version is built from the same source at the current Xitami
releases, but with the HTTPS support added in.  So no, if it doesn't
work in the current Xitami releases, it won't work any better in the Pro
version.

i know. your implementation its gentle enough to handle LRWP 1.0
too.

my new one simply bails out. but: the LRWP implementation of
xitami was buggy before beta 5 so it doesn't matter ;-)

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] New SMT Agents  API
Message-ID: <GMEIJMPDFMEGPAGNKHKDIEGNCBAA.rafael.cano@o-labs.com>

 Hi.

 I've been porting some of my old SMT Agents to the new
 API (declare_..., send_..., get_... ) and, after some
 effort in understanding these functions and macros, my code
 has become much cleaner and easier to maintain. No more
 exdr_* stuff ;-)

 Just a few questions:

 Why have the messages "SMTSOCK WRITE/INPUT/OUTPUT OK" dissapear?.

 Is there anyone thinking of writing some "SMT Kernel and Agents
 Programming Reference"?. I would be willing to cooperate.

 Are all the SMT subdirectories in CVS the same?. It seems so,
 but I would appreciate some explanation of the CVS tree.


 Regards.

smtSock has been extensively rewritten, and sort of combined with the
smttime functions.  I haven't been working on it so I don't precisely
recall what happened to the smtsock write/input/output okay messages,
but I'll forward your message to the person who was.

> Is there anyone thinking of writing some "SMT Kernel and Agents
> Programming Reference"?. I would be willing to cooperate.

Feel free to start :-)  (It's a really excellent idea, but no one at
iMatix has had much time to work on the code, let alone documentation.)

> Are all the SMT subdirectories in CVS the same?. It seems so,
> but I would appreciate some explanation of the CVS tree.

Yes.  All the public SMT directories are actually linux symlinks to the
same directory.  Checking in/out of any public SMT directory will get
you the same code/change all of them.  Cleaning this up further is on 
our "to do" list.  (There are also some internal SMT directories which
have cached copies of things like the code in Xitami 2.4d9, since it
didn't exactly correspond to anything in the CVS archive.)

Hi
 just wondering if there's a plug-in so to use the Xitami web server (and
hopefully the servlet runner)
within an Java IDE such as Jbuilder (my need is to debug my application ....
maybe there's another IDE integrable with Xitami debugging)

Thanks in advance

Considering that Xitami is written in C, I doubt that it would run all
that well in a Java IDE...

However if you want to debug a Java LRWP application (which is my guess)
then you should be able to run Xitami in one window, quite separately,
and then start the Servlet Runner (which is Java) in the IDE.  Some
random fiddling with runtime environment may be required, particularly
if you try to use the old iMatix beta ServletRunner rather than the
newer one that Bernd Hohmann has been working on.

I have to build a web application based on servlet. That application will
need to be runned on Xitami web server and will use xitami servlet runner
(have the beta3 release now). I would like to develop the application in an
IDE (now we use JBuilder 6 Enterprise) and have the opportunity to debug it
before deploy it. Jbuilder allows to remote debug, but needs a plugin to
recognize the web/application server ... this is because it searches for all
java native servers, while Xitami exe should be (for what i saw) in c++ ...
dunno ...
my application have to build a dynamic page , which have a state based on
session cookies and querystring. Each object in it is defined by a dynamic
xml file given to an appropriate gsl file which by using xitami's "gslgen"
read correctly the page ...

I'm not sure how you would go about debugging it if it is run by xitami 
servlet runner.  Many IDEs have advanced debug tools, including the option to 
begin debugging an application after it's already been executed (my 
experience is with MSVC++)  As long as you can see your way around the 
machine code, that's one way you can go about doing it.

Done it! ok just made a main class which loads the xitami servlet runner,
then i can use my IDE debugging instructions to debug the application which
is used OUTSIDE ... obviously it needs to be running xitami ws ... but
jbuilder 6 enterprise by default uses tomcat 3.2.3 and xitami servlet runner
seems to b much faster and lighter ,,, :)

my suggestion: import the sourcecode of http://runner.conacom.de
into a separate project and run the runner from there.

thats the way we're developing webapplications and the
servletrunner too.

hi,

this update fixes some performance issues in the logwriter (1000
lines need 3 seconds, now only 1 second) and in the LRWP
handling (15% performance boost).

i also added a "stress test" with an automatic test also.

the webpage is rewritten, i created some nice tables with
performance values of xitami in comparision to the
servletrunner.

this was a problem which i fixed 2002/04/07.

in the runner, there is a TestServlet included where you can
test the cookies.

if the latest version of the runner doesn't fixes the problem, i
need a small test-servlet from you where the error occurs.

i will take the source to my homeoffice and monitor the
mailinglists this weekend.

Message-ID: <020401c1e80f$a669a760$0301a8c0@Mesa.com>

Hi,

I've just started to really look at the Xitami application and am interested
in using the FTP portion only. Has anyone created a stripped down version of
the Xitami app with just the FTP functionality. Also, I might be interested
in adapting the code to utilize configurable TCP windows to support auto
tuning between my FTP client. Does anyone know if Xitami already supports
auto configurable TCP windows, or has anyone already done any work in this
area?

Any assitance or pointers will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Bruce Douglas

What does "tcp windows'" mean?  I have a general idea of what you're saying, 
but I'm not entirely sure.  Personally I think if you want _just_ an ftp 
server, you should probably look somewhere other than xitami.

hey...

The term "TCP window" refers to the size of the TCP buffer used in
communication between the client/server applications. In most apps, the is
set to some default which may or may not be optimal depending on the network
traffic (among other things).

We've been looking for an FTP server with source code for the Windows
platform with no luck. Do you have a suggestion??

Thanks

  What does "tcp windows'" mean?  I have a general idea of what you're
saying, but I'm not entirely sure.  Personally I think if you want _just_ an
ftp server, you should probably look somewhere other than xitami.
