Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Xitami/2.5 on Github
Message-ID: <5821ea240904280524l5d7a1a11if7b7cd3b73a25dbd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi people,

I've uploaded the latest Xitami/2.5 sources to a git repository at
http://github.com/pieterh/Xitami-25/tree/master

Reason being, I was testing this vulnerability -
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34681/info - and needed to rebuild
Xitami.  Our svn tree of Xitami/2.5 does not work any longer, it
depends on out of date tools.

FWIW, Xitami/2.5 does not have that vulnerability but in the meantime
I made some other patches like getting it working on 64-bit Linux.

-Pieter
