Hello Ewen

Trust you will recollect our earlier email interactions in connection with
the Xitami DEV workgroup. I sent an email to Pieter and to Valerie reg some
development that we would like to commission. I have not got any response
from either. Can I request you to assist in getting a response.

Thanks

PS ... I've finally managed to get the 'local redirection' on the Xitami
web server working. Will post it to Xitami DEV soon.


Copy of EMail

Hello Valerie

We are a 12 year old software company (http://www.imagingindia.com)
focussed on
the document imaging and document management application space. We are
also happy users of iMatix technologies - Xitami, SFL and GSL.

We have significant opportunities in the BPO (Business Process
Outsourcing) market since a lot of new outsourced services depend on
scanned images as the basis for their service offerings. One of the
development initiatives we are considering is an image store based on
internet protocols. In the BPO space, this store will be used to receive

images from scanning locations and to serve images to clients processing

the data. In the document management space, this store will be used as a

Document Image Server. The volume of data in the store would be high -
from a few 100 MB per day to a few GB per day.

I am writing to enquire whether iMatix would be interested in
undertaking this development. If yes, I could provide you with further
details on the application based on which you could provide cost and
time estimates. We expect to commission the project between the middle
and end of May.

Look forward to your reply

Regards

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] ReverseDNS logging ?
Message-ID: <WorldClient-F200304161331.AA31500009@coaxial.ca>

I had forgotten I was subscribed to this list :)

So I've been having this problem forever, I'm probably doing something
wrong.. I'm hoping someone can help me out.

I generate demographics for my domains using Webalizer, unfortunatley the
demographics server is a windows machine, so webalizer won't do reverse-
DNS
(only works in the unix version)

Xitami has a reverse DNS setting in the 'logging' configuration.. but for
the life of me I can't get it to work at all.

I've enabled reverse-DNS, entered my DNS servers, nothing happens, 
logfiles are still recording IPs, no hostnames.

This is happening on several machines, running both the current 
production release and the latest beta. 

Also, If I "debug dns queries" where does that debug to ? 

Any help would be much appreciated !

Thanks,
Josh
