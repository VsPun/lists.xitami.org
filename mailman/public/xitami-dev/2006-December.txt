Hi Everyone,

I am seeing the following Runtime error with Xitami, can anybody suggest me on this:

Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self: (Getting-Event, No-Activity-Event)
19/Sep/2006:13:54:21 +0100
Abort at smttime:Generate-Response-Events:expire old requests (Expect-Event, Timer-Event)

After this error,Xitami is getting aborted.


Thanks
Vishal.

Hi,

This error i am seeing, when submitting request to Xitami from multiple systems.Not sure whether
this is causing the abort.Is it because of Active X controls enabled on my browser.Please suggest
me on this...

Thanks,
Vishal

Hi Shiva,

Thanks for you reply.This was recorded when it got crashed on 19/sep.I am seeing the same error
when it is crashing or aborting specific to that particular date and time.Server has been properly
configured for current date and month.Before getting aborted, i am seeing a Pop-up with a message
as "Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library-Runtime Error! abnormal program termination".Can you
please suggest me on this....

Turn on the debug option in the administration, just as you said.
Xitami will then create additional log files in a directory called "debug"
After a few web page requests, you should see the following files:

    * debug.log
    * header.log
    * request.log

There may be others if CGI's, filters, or SSI is called.  Not sure.
