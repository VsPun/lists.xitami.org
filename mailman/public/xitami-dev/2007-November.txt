Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Boomake Error
Message-ID: <BLU106-W32681B62D474257BA81171B37C0@phx.gbl>


Hi,
After setting IBASE dir, and building foreign. I then goes to base type in 
boomake build and get the following error:

boom I: [lr]: Building Libero...
boomake: line 154: c: command not found
boom E: [lr]: "c -q -li /Source/imatix/base-1.2d7/_install/include -ll /Source/imatix/base-1.2d7/_install/lib lr" failed - stop
boom E: [base]: stop

I am not up to speed on boom yet!

Jim

The 'c' file is missing from the Xitami source package, you can get it
from http://download.imatix.com/pub/.

Also attached.  Install somewhere on your path, make executable, and
the Xitami build should work.

Hi,
I get the following error when build the base portion.

boom I: [base]: Processing project in gsl...
boom I: [gsl]: Building GSL...
ggzip.c:46:17: error: zip.h: No such file or directory
ggzip.c:47:19: error: unzip.h: No such file or directory

Is this in the files and not in the path?

Jim

OK, in that case you should first build the 'foreign' package that is
also listed on http://download.imatix.com/pub/.  Base depends on a
number of libraries (including zlib) which are in the foreign package.

Hi all,

maybe it's not new, but

xixlog.c, module send_request_to_resolver(), line 

 send_get_host_name (&rdnsq, 0, tcb-> log-> ip_server, 0);

should be, imho,

 send_get_host_name (&rdnsq, 0, tcb-> log-> ip_client, 0);

otherwise you always log your own name.

Best regards.

Maurilio

Ok, thanks for the fix, I've put into the Xitami source tree.

Hi Pieter,

any news about making xitami open-source? I mean, having a site with the code
as you said sometime ago.

best regards.

All the code is on xitami.org.  Do you mean something else?

Pieter,

it seemed to me, reading this list and [xitami] list that you were going to
set up a cvs server or something like this to make it easier for people to
contribute to xitami and to create a community around it.

Maybe it was just my wishfull thinking :)

Best regards.

Maurilio.

Ah, yes.  I spoke about moving xitami.org to a wiki, and opening
access to the subversion tree.

If you actually want to contribute to Xitami, I'll arrange this.

Pieter,

no, I don't have code to contribute right now, I was thinking about the
community at large; having a wiki, a svn repository (we already have these
lists) would make it possible to attract people willing to contribute.

A message to slashdot and one to freshmeat to let the world know that xitami
is open-source and maybe the community will start forming and growing :) this
is what I hope.

I think that xitami still has strenghts compared to apache or lighttpd, it's
something in between them and its a 'pity' that it cannot have a community
around it.

Best regards.

Maurilio.
