<PRE>&gt;<i> We have -- as you see -- been working on SMT despite the apparent 
</I>&gt;<i> silence over the last year or two.  smtsock and smttime no longer 
</I>&gt;<i> exist.  Their functions are now carried out inside the kernel itself. 
</I>For me, it was very nice and consistent reaching the Kernel services very
same as all other components (agents). Anyway, SMT is a chained
multi-threading kernel you mention in the doc. Partially, that's why I
have no problem living with the Kernel on the same &quot;level&quot;, I was
cooperative ;)

&gt;<i> I'll get someone to post a summary of the changes and how to convert 
</I>&gt;<i> your SMT agents.
</I>That would be nice to see the improvements in one place together! Thanks!

Cheers,
Laszlo
