Nope, you simply can't get there from here it seems.

SMT in CVS needs GSL from CVS, as was stated.

Can't build GSL from CVS because there is no build instructions of any kind, 
and I don't fell like creating them.  Also the gsl files won't build with the 
old version of gsl from Xitami, so even if there was build instructions, I 
still don't think I could build it.  To many circular build problems.

&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, yes, making this all easier to build is on our list of things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to do -- pretty high on our list these days :-)
</I>
I guess I'll just wait...

Please test on a clean machine starting where you have no tools but the 
standard GNU tool chain, like I'm trying to start with...
