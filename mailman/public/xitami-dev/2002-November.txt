Absolute paths to the compiler? You really do know better than that.

If you do not define the MSVCDir variable, Base won't be able to use 
the MSVC compiler from the command line.  It does look for it, but 
not too hard.

We had to take out support for other Win32 compilers from the 
compilation script (c.bat) because this support was broken in about 
20 places.

Pieter,

This variable must be peculiar to MSVC 6, since I've never come across
it. I don't blame you for dropping the other compilers, most were unable
to compile this stuff any longer without a lot of work.

It compiles OK with MSVC 5 but complains a little about some switches
used.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] favicon.ico
Message-ID: <3DE82C4A.6211DDC3@ob-wan.com>

Hi guys,

If you've seen your server logs filling with requests for this file,
it's only IE 5 looking for an icon to associate with links to your site.
You have the following choices as to what you should do about it:

1. Block requests for the file in your firewall

2. Install a virus called favicon.ico to crash IE 5 :)
   See http://www.magnux.com/~flaviovs/sec/favicon/privacy.html

3. Play Microsoft's silly little game and install an icon

If you decide to go #3 you'll need to add the following to xitami.cfg in
the image MIME types section:

    ico=image/x-icon

Then create a 16x16 16-colour icon and link it from your site's header
template (you're still handwriting html? shame!) thusly:

<LINK REL="SHORTCUT ICON" href="/path/foo.ico">

Icon editors are a dime a dozen, or you can do it online at
http://www.favicon.co.uk

Cheers!

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Isapid. I cannot get upload to PHP  to work.
Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021129200500.030845f0@mail.brd.com>

Hi folks:

I wonder what to do. I am running ISAPID with xitami and it works great
running the PHP4ISAPI.dll module.

Except  that I cannot get it to upload a file. Xitami with plain PHP.EXE works
fine, but when I try to use ISAPID.EXE I get gibberish instead of the 
uploaded file.

Anything I can do to correct the problem? I use forms that are
multipart/form data. The rest of the fields except the uploaded file come
OK.

Regards,

George
