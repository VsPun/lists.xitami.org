Subject: [Xitami-Dev] LRWP: Name length limitations ?
Message-ID: <200106021724.TAA29425@sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.com>

do we have some obscure limits in the xitami LRWP process ?

i'm starting 4 servlet processes:

ytm.conacom.hr.servlets.ListApp
ytm.conacom.hr.servlets.ListAppEx
ytm.conacom.hr.servlets.DetailApp
ytm.conacom.hr.servlets.DetailAppEx

which connects as servlet/ytm.conacom.hr.servlets.ListApp etc..

the xitami console window tells me, that all 4 different
servlets are connected.

but: sometimes an url-request to
servlet/ytm.conacom.hr.servlets.ListAppEx starts ListApp
(instead of ListAppEx) ?

any ideas ?

No, but they match on a "prefix" basis; by scanning a list of registered
LRWP URL paths.  So the order in which your servlets register will be
VERY important if you want to call them names that overlap.  (Alas, I
don't remember if it pushes onto the front of the list, or adds to the
end, so you'll eitehr need to register the "...Ex" ones last, or first.)

The best way to work around this is simply _not_ to give them names
where some of them are the prefix of others :-)

last, i presume. i'll consider it in the next version of the
servlet runner - currently i have to put a 300ms delay in the
startup loop because the registrationprocess "servlet -> lrwp"
is asynchronous and causes a more or less "random" behaviour.

after finally finding a link386.exe (didn't installed it) i get
a lot of link errors building beta4 as production release (crt0
and other stuff). 

debug and standard are ok (using the linker from the EMX
package). 

are there special environment variables for link386.exe ?

It's been quite a while since I've done this, but as I recall it, the
debug and standard versions build a.out (COFF) executables, which then
have an EMX header applied to them, and pretty much everything is done
with the EMX tools.

The production version builds .obj/.lib files, and is linked through the
EMX front end to link386.  Certainly you can't link using link386
directly, unless you supply all the arguments that the EMX front end
would supply.

As far as I remember the c.cmd script has the logic needed to do this
providing all the objects are build in production mode, the libraries
built in production mode, and you link in production mode.

For the "diehard fans only", they can get it from CVS.  ViewCVS will let
you look at what is there:

http://cvs.imatix.com./cgi-bin/viewcvs/

Our public CVS archive is in the middle of a rearrangement at present,
so it's a bit messy (eg, there are multiple names for many things: the
shorter ones are the newer ones).

The modules you need are "sfl", "smt", and "gsl".  The GSL there is GSL3.

There are brief details on how to get a (read only) copy from CVS on
that webpage, as well as the ability to navigate the archive.

Personally I'd tend to use GSL for dynamic XML -> HTML conversion for
relatively small things; and I'd tend to avoid on-the-fly conversion of
anything large (irrespective of technology) because it takes too long.
GSL3 in the Xitami in CVS is somewhat better for on-the-fly conversion
because it's a SMT-agent itself, and so can be multithreaded with other
things.  (The GSL2 in Xitami 2.5b5 has to run to completion before
anything else can be done.)  (Note however that the GSL3/Xitami
interface is still in a state of flux and not entirely debugged.)

As you say XSLT is more difficult to learn than GSL, and from what I've
seen to date, not really any faster to write/use than GSL.  So I don't
think there's all that much advantage in learning it just to do dynamic
XML->HTML conversions if you already know GSL.

Unfortunately Internet Explorer's "friendly" error messages obscure what
really happened.  Could you perhaps try this again with either Xitami's
debugging mode turned on ([Server] debug=1), and then check the debug
logs to see what Xitami found, or with Internet Explorer's "friendly"
error messages turned off (so that it shows the error message the server
sent).

Also remember you need to run Xitami, then run the isapid program to
"hook in" to Xitami, then try accessing things.

All I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you :-)

later.
