Hi All

I am reading a book called Design Patterns in
Communications Software. And guess what they say about
developing real time , ultra reliable, communications
software.

1) Do not use processes
2) Run to completion 
3) Fresh work before stale (LIFO) [ I am sure that can
be easily done in SMT]

I have not read the whole book but I am sure that I
will discover more Patterns that are already used in
SMT.

What I think is needed for SMT to become popular is a
good book. I have read Jim Coplien's book on Advanced
C++, where I knew that what he was saying made sense
but it was really difficult to use. Then came the
Design Patterns book by GoF, and things were much
clearer and finally understood the concepts that Mr.
Coplien was trying to express. Similarly what SMT
needs is a good book with simple examples at the start
and finally ending in Basic Introduction to Xitami
where it all ties together. Chapters on adapting SMT
to Windows Messaging Model with sample code and Simple
Database access through SMT is a must.

Easy to use Object Oriented Interface would be great.
[ I am sure that if Pieter would guide us in
converting the SMT code into C++ iteratively, we would
all volunteer for the effort]

Just my opinion
