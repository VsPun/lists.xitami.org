Hello,

Is there any effort to make SFL thread safe? 

Maybe, I'll do it sometime if no one else :) because I just love SMT but it
cannot use the power of multi-processors which is the default way to
increase server capacity (eg. web or other service-like). And, as one of my
pal says, it &quot;linearizes&quot; the program which means it serves the requests in
order of arrival but with threads requests would see an &quot;equally
distributed&quot; ;) response delay instead of that related to actual queue
position... OR, you (the programmer) must unroll every for() into 
event_send(myself)..

Enough comments :) Actually, I pick up with QpThread C++ lib portable to win
and unix. It has safe queue support inside. So, I play with the thougths to
build an SMT like AGENT set primarily with net and timer support but all
thread being a real thread or can be a real thread, using safe queues. Oh
yeah, I know it is lots of work.. but sometimes it may pay.. :)


Further back, I made a Java SMT but without standard agents (I was no more
time). Somebody interested? It works with Java 1.2 or 1.3.0 as far as I
remember. I may provide it &quot;as is&quot; to anybody but it may require some review
before &quot;official&quot; use (actually I have no time to do this).

Regards,
Laszlo
