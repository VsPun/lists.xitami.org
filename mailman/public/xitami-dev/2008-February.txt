Don't use tabs - GSL barfs on them...

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] New wiki project for Xitami
Message-ID: <5821ea240802070731t5bd89c6al27cf3c779b42f79a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is to announce the launch of a new wiki project for Xitami.

The site is currently at http://xitami.wikidot.com.

The goal is to migrate all existing documentation for Xitami to this
site and create a new place for the community of Xitami users.  As
many of you have told me, the old site is broken, links like
http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index.htm don't work any more.

When the site begins to take shape we'll move it to www.xitami.org and
archive the old site.

Right now, I'm looking for volunteers to help edit the site.  It's
really simple - it's a wiki - and all hands are welcome.

To join the wiki site, register on Wikidot and then join on
http://xitami.wikidot.com/system:join.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Info on W32 requirements
Message-ID: <47AFB5FB.50400@gpsl.net>

I want to have a closer look at the code gen stuff, used to interest me.

I wanted to compile under XP which is more convenient for playing around.

There seems to be kind of zero information about what is needed to 
compile, attempt it and it complains. Not a lot of VC98 installs left. 
Given the automatic build systems with no docs it is kind of hard to 
port to what resources I do have.

Others must have hit this problem and so can I have some pointers please.

(I'm a bit old and slow, been out of programming for a long time, what 
is obvious might not be to me)
