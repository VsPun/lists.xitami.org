Hi,

I am trying to write a servlet runner using C++, for Xitami, using LRWP. I 
have a few questions:

1) To have cookie support, I use HTTP headers. How do I send HTTP headers 
through an LRWP object? (struct)
2) The LRWP object has only cgi information (as a symbol table), an outbuf 
character buffer (where I can pour all the response from a servlet). I am 
assuming that the "post_data" and "cgi" variables would be filled in by 
the web server when I read from the socket, and I have to fill the outbuf 
with the response I get  (from a  servlet). Is that right? 

Hi Bernd (Hohmann), if you are seeing this mail: I tried to get some 
architectural/design details form your Java servlet runner, but could not 
find technical details. Could you please let me know if you can help me 
with any questions? 

Thanks,
Sameer
