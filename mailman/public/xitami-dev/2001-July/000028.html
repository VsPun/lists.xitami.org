<PRE>HI there.

I've tried the port of Xitami for BeOS. Look good BUT....
I have some problems:
FTP hangs when logging on. I've read that the NT version 2.5b4 has the same
problem.
Admin-section doesn't work, I believe it's a problem with tha path to
images, which is acting weird.

Do you have any solutions/ideas????

I've enabled outside admin, and trying to use it from Win98, the reason I
need it is because the server physically is placed 65 km away, I can
sometimes load the admin pages on the server, but never from the outside, I
get login, and it tries to load but can't (hangs). When I load the server it
says &quot;web server binding to address 127.0.0.1&quot;, can this be the problem, the
rest of the web server is working fine, except sometimes the images is
missing. The FTP server is enabled and I get Welcome text, logon OK,
Logintext OK and then ex. CuteFTP says:
STATUS:&gt;	Login successful
COMMAND:&gt;	TYPE I
	200 Command okay
COMMAND:&gt;	pwd
	257 &quot;/&quot; is the current directory
COMMAND:&gt;	TYPE A
	200 Command okay

	227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,0,2,0,200)

STATUS:&gt;	Trashed response received
	421 Service not available at present
STATUS:&gt;	Disconnect: Thursday 00:00:02 07-12-2001

and then I'm stuck. It doesn't matter what user I'm logging on as.

I hope you can make something of this.
