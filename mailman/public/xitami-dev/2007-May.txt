Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Administrivia: New mailing list server
Message-ID: <20070503024710.2ED60112E1F@wat.la.naos.co.nz>

Hi,

The lists.xitami.org domain, and hence this list
<xitami-dev at lists.imatix.org> has been relocated to a new iMatix mail server
(smtp.imatix.com).  All the details for the mailing list remain the
same, including subscriptions, email addresses, and the mailing list
archives.

We don't expect any problems with the new location, but if you do notice
a problem please contact me directly off list (ewen at imatix.com).

Thanks,

Ewen
