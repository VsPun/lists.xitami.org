The site host went out of business. Ewen is working to fix it, but has
not finalized things. 

Try  http://www.xitami.org/

On that site's Downloads page: links under "Current production release -
2.4d9" and "2.5 Beta release" that go to the server  users.skynet.be  do
work, but the links under "USA Mirror Site" that go to  www.xitami.com 
do not work today. Most of the mirror sites have obsolete versions or
are down. 

The "Xitami Developers' Pages" at http://www.xitami.org/developer.htm do
work today. 

Imatix's main page at http://www.imatix.com/ is working (but the link to
Xitami there goes to the failed server [and is outdated]).

If portions of xitami are open-source as is mentioned on their sites,
why isn't it moved to sourceforge.com?

Also - if Ewen needs some space I have access to some free space at a
large provider here in Canada at least temorarily. Please contact me
Ewen.

Not everyone wants to give VA control over all their source :-)

As I just noted, the provider that was hosting www.xitami.com vanished
without warning; and we've been moving to regain control of the domain
and update the DNS records.  This has been done, and RSN it should work.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

As per earlier discussions on the Xitami (Users) list, the company that
hosted www.xitami.com for us disappeared without warning.  We have just
finished the process of updating the DNS records to point at a webserver
that actually exists, and those changes should become visible RSN.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Meanwhile: http://www.xitami.org/  should work right away.

As of late Friday in the eastern US via a commercial ISP,
www.xitami.com is working; web page and downloads.

Thanks!

Hello All,

I am in the middle of porting Xitami (24d9) to the AS/400.  I have it all 
compiling and am working my way through the platform inconsistencies and 
assumptions (i.e., some things don't work :)

However, I have some questions regarding the capabilities of Xitami that 
are not apparent from my reading of the documentation.

Q/  Does Xitami provide full support for HTTP/1.1?  Specifically HTTP 
header directives relating to compression. This is part of the Content 
Encoding and supports must_server and must_client (something like that) tag 
directives.

I see the 24d9 documentation indicates that virtual hosting from HTTP/1.1 
is supported and the Xitami 2.5b5 (Beta) docs say the following:

"Further support for HTTP/1.1, including partial GETs. We now consider 
Xitami to be a HTTP/1.1 server, although a number of optional HTTP/1.1 
features are not yet implemented. The critical features implemented are: 
keep-alive handling, document publishing, resume (partial GET), and 
HTTP/1.1 virtual hosts."

which suggests to me that Xitami does not support these functions.  Is that 
true?  If so, is it likely that they will be supported?  If so, any idea on 
time frame?

Regards,
Simon Coulter.

As far as I know Xitami doesn't support compression at all at present.
As you noted the Xitami 2.5 beta (currently 2.5b5) does support many of
the core HTTP/1.1 features, such as virtual hosting, and keep alive
handling, but not all of them are completely debugged.

>If so, is it likely that they will be supported?  If so, any idea on

They'll be supported when someone writes the code to support them :-)

Xitami maintenance is largely on a "as time is available" basis at
iMatix, as evidenced by the relatively unchanged nature of Xitami over
the past year or two.  Contributions of source code to support these
features is always welcomed :-)

Hello Ewen,

Thanks for the speedy response.  It is as I suspected but it is better to 
have confirmation.  I take your point about available time but I can't 
promise whether we will implement the needed functions.  I have to get the 
basic Xitami functioning on the AS/400 first and we have similar 
constraints on our time -- a small matter of earning a living :)

Sorry for not setting a subject on my original note.

Regards,
Simon Coulter.
