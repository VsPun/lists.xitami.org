Unfortunately Internet Explorer's "friendly" error messages obscure what
really happened.  Could you perhaps try this again with either Xitami's
debugging mode turned on ([Server] debug=3D1), and then check the debug
logs to see what Xitami found, or with Internet Explorer's "friendly"
error messages turned off (so that it shows the error message the server
sent).

Also remember you need to run Xitami, then run the isapid program to
"hook in" to Xitami, then try accessing things.

hmm....
When did the initial comment get posted to the list ?

anyway.....

firstly: the isapi.zip file available from xitami.com is version 11b. So if
you have a problem you should get the latest file.

when you run isapid.exe you should pass it command line options.
For example :
isapid -app isapi_exe

now when you go to the page

http://<xitami>/isapi_exe

You get the follow page :
<html><header><title>Isapi extension error</title></header>
<Body><H2>Xitami ISAPI extension error</H2><HR><I>Error on load  (126)
</I></body></html>

The "error on load" is because the dll file specified i.e. NULL does not
exist.

To use the testisapi example, you need to connect to
http://<xitami>/isapi_exe/testisapi.dll
and this then works correctly.


Now....

I'm still trying to work out how directory resolution works in xitami
For example :
http://127.0.0.1:8080/isapi_exe///../testisapi.dll displays that url, and
the testisapi.dll example.

However the url http://127.0.0.1:8080/isapi_exe//../../testisapi.dll
redirects the user to http://127.0.0.1:8080/testisapi.dll, which then gives
a 404 response.

Ewen - care to explain how that one works?  ;)

Yes it was a while ago that I posted the original message, but I was getting
so much email that it must of slipped thru. I only found it because I was
looking thru it for something else !! Thanks for the help I`ll download the
lastest version of isapid and see if I can get it working.. You`ve made my
day, thanks !! :o)

Guys,

This one's nasty. Win NT SP6a with all security patches installed.
Xitami service fails to work, any version. ANY version, I tried 2.3d and
2.5b4

I believe the troublesome patch is the one related to registry security,
which I installed after seeing this:

http://grc.com/pw/patchwork.htm

but it may also be related to the Service Pack level. Xitami still works
from the DOS console, however, so all is not lost.

Have you tried the current 2.4d9 or 2.5b5 builds?  Not that I expect any
major differences, but it'd be useful to know if those fail too as we've
got the source for both carefully issolated so we know what is in them.

>I believe the troublesome patch is the one related to registry security,

Okay.  In what way does Xitami fail to work?  Does the service not
register?  Or does it not start?  Are there any log messages.  If the
patch is a "registry security" one I could see how registering the
service might run into problems, but not how some of the other things
could fail, especially given the console mode still works.

More information/experimentation welcomed.

Ewen,

Xitami starts fine, but can't be accessed from the internet. I haven't
tried any later builds because they haven't been available online AFAIK.
My last view of the download site still listed 2.5b4 as the latest, and
that was only last week.

Rob
p.s. I have Xitami running as a service under BeOS now.

The new downloads are only on http://www.xitami.com/.

http://www.imatix.com/ needs a more thorough overview so we haven't
tried to update that at this stage.

I'll report the bug to them.

My suggestion: Don't use ZoneAlarm for your Xitami server. It's great at 
your workstation though.
When I opened ZoneAlarm enough the crackers/hackers came quickly.  I had a 
far better
result with Tiny Personal Firewall. It takes a little time to set it up but 
it can open the link
just enough for your server to be fully operational, but no more.

George,

Actually, I eventually got it to work. The trouble is that I have a 
Linksys router interposed between my PC and the Alcatel ADSL modem, and 
ZoneAlarm didn't know about the new version of Xitami I just installed. 
When it got a reply back from my router it was expecting to see a reply 
from my actual static IP number and panicked.

They didn't build in a proxy setting into the free version, and I don't 
know if the paid-for one has it either. I got around it by plugging 
straight into the ADSL line, invoking Xitami, telling ZA that it was OK 
to let it be a server then going back to the original setup. 

But I will not ever be ONE DAY without a proper firewall again after 
seeing how many people scan the addresses. See also:

Rob:

I found that when I used ZoneAlarm the crackers were able to plant lots of 
their stuff
in my server, I spent a whole week cleaning up "services" that they were 
able to run
in my server. Most of these services were normal applications that 
companies such as
Compaq use to allow their technical support people to operate as remote 
control their
customers' machines to solve problems. Too bad that the "support" was not 
what I really
looked forward to. The warez gentlemen were able to stop my server twice, 
and I had
to change all my passwords several times.

After I installed Tiny (which like ZoneAlarm is also free) I was able to 
contain all this
circus. No more problems since, except seeing all the scanning that is 
going on and which
is very worrisome. Seems that in my NT machines the first thing they try is 
to get into
Netbios port to get the system to enumerate itself.

Anyway, I am glad everything is working for you.

George,

When you say "services" I assume you mean that in the NT sense, as a 
system service. There's a registry patch that makes this impossible, 
see www.grc.com

I'm currently running the server in the Linksys "DMZ" fully visible, 
but only while I set up the system. It also has firewall capability, 
and allows me to open up just the required ports, as you suggested. 
That's the way I'll be going in the long term. Still testing right now.

Rob

Rob:

Yes, the crackers were planting and running services.
Thanks for the information. I will go back to check Gibsons's web
site again.

The ports that the hackers were trying to reach were the
netbios related ports 134-139. Also there was a lot of action in
trying to ftp-in their programs. All of that was blocked, I think.
Of course there is always the chance of them succeeding and
leaving something inside. One other thing they tried was to use
Microsoft Messaging and IRC. So their approach was similar but
not equal to the problems Gibson faced. I cut off all these services
in the server.

Regards,


George

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Xitami for BeOS
Message-ID: <NEBBJNPBILLCPIGFCBEDMEDOCBAA.fveggerby@fdf.dk>

HI there.

I've tried the port of Xitami for BeOS. Look good BUT....
I have some problems:
FTP hangs when logging on. I've read that the NT version 2.5b4 has the same
problem.
Admin-section doesn't work, I believe it's a problem with tha path to
images, which is acting weird.

Do you have any solutions/ideas????

I've enabled outside admin, and trying to use it from Win98, the reason I
need it is because the server physically is placed 65 km away, I can
sometimes load the admin pages on the server, but never from the outside, I
get login, and it tries to load but can't (hangs). When I load the server it
says "web server binding to address 127.0.0.1", can this be the problem, the
rest of the web server is working fine, except sometimes the images is
missing. The FTP server is enabled and I get Welcome text, logon OK,
Logintext OK and then ex. CuteFTP says:
STATUS:>	Login successful
COMMAND:>	TYPE I
	200 Command okay
COMMAND:>	pwd
	257 "/" is the current directory

	200 Command okay

and then I'm stuck. It doesn't matter what user I'm logging on as.

I hope you can make something of this.
