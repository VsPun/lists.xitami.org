Well, it's a long story.  We've been doing a *lot* of code generation these=
=20
last years, developing GSL and frameworks around that.  We now write our C=
=20
code using a kind of XML class language called iCL (iMatix Class Language).=
 =20
SMT (now in version 4.2) is built on that.  We don't use Libero anymore, bu=
t=20
XML-based state machine designs. =20

If you have looked at Boom, you will see where we were with this technology=
=20
about 2 years ago.  It's improved a lot since then.  It's become very meta,=
=20
with code generators building code generators, and so on.  Software nanotec=
h,=20
kind of.

The result is something called &quot;Base/2&quot; (we dropped the unfortunate &quot;Reali&quot;=
=20
prefix).

Base/2 is still being developed, quite aggressively, since we are using it =
for=20
a large custom project.  By the end of this year we hope to have rewritten=
=20
everything in the old realibase (Base/1) that we still use - boom, gsl, etc=
=2E =20
SFL is being partly replaced by the Apache Runtime, partly rewritten as iCL=
=20
classes.  Htmlpp and Libero will be retired.

At that stage we will have the tools we need to do a refresh of Xitami.  Pa=
rt=20
of what we're making may possibly include an HTTP server, which would look=
=20
remarkably like Xitami, rewritten from the ground up.

So the planning for releasing the new Base/2, which will include SMT, GSL,=
=20
iCL, etc. is around the end of this year.

If you really want a version before then, ask me and we can arrange somethi=
ng. =20
Base/2 is GPL'd with a commercial opt-out as usual.
