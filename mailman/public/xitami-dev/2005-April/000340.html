Of course. :-)

We do so many utterly stupid things it's hard to keep track.  Perhaps BeOS 
support was one of those things we cleaned-up since 2001.  (That's a 
euphemism for &quot;wtf is this, I'm deleting it...&quot;)

... Just did a quick scan of the code.  Xitami 2.4 has no BeOS support.  2.5 
does.  The RealiBase 'c' script (which does the compilation) does.  

So it should all be fine.

Cheers,
