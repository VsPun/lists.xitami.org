http://coaxial.ca  is my PHPNUKE - voting or logging in doesnt work
http://coaxial.ca/new is my LandDownUnder - same sort of "refresh" or
"submit" functions don't work
http://coaxial.ca/test.php  shows some php info.

I Can turn on all errors and warnings in my php.ini if you want, and all the
errs will be displayed on the pages.

A google search for "xitami 404 phpnuke" returns insteresting results,
everyone with this issue has not been able to find a solution, and has
switched to either IIS or Apache. I'm making a plan to migrate some 50+
domains from xitami to apache now.

cc:ing the xitami and xitami-dev lists.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Josh
