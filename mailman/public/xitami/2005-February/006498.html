<PRE>&gt;<i> And as someone else said, you need to check your DSL TOS.=20

</I>&gt;<i> you would probably be fine until your bandwidth got very high.

Important to note: even though you might be able to *get away with it*,
when the ISP finally folds your account for TOS reasons, every one of
your hosted websites will cease to be connected to the web. This would
tick me off a lot if I had paid for hosting.
