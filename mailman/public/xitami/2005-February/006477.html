<PRE>hi,
want to throw in my opinion too:
first and foremost i welcome any initiative to liven up the xitami 
community, since i think xitami is a great thing and the people joining the 
actual list make up a helpful and nice community.
but i turned away from irc,well, a number of years ago, since for technical 
discussions it has one major drawback - knowhow exchanged is volatile, 
anyone woh isn't there at the right moment doesn't get the useful 
information. this leads to two things:
- questions are asked over and over again, since you'cant lookup what has 
been talked about
- you are not automatically updated on issues you havent noticed that far 
(e.g. security stuff, features you didn' recognize until you get an info on it)

so, you had to be on the channel around the clock; given that it is very 
improbable that a critical mass of users will be reache, it would be way 
boring to han around there all alone.

I'd prefer a modern forum already mentioned by others. Such a thing could 
easily replace the mailing list if there were a need for replacement and 
enhance it probably. (I'd use an RSS-feed to grab the latest stuff and 
thereby have the full mailing list functionality plus other things).

of course, as an _addition_ an irc-channel would be a nice thing too for 
people who like it that way.

my two cents,
tony
