<PRE>Hi Everyone,

<A HREF="mailto:thomas@kenshi.dk">thomas@kenshi.dk</A> asked me about an IRC channel.  My reaction was &quot;sure, why 
not?&quot;  Now, this reaction has gotten me into deep water often but a Xitami 
IRC channel seems harmless enough.  Not like that time with the... but that's 
another story.

Now Mark Doigny points out that there have been alternatives to this mailing 
list proposed before, and they tend to fizzle out.

What's my position on this?  Well, first, I think any party succeeds only when 
the guests are fun.  What I mean is: iMatix can sponsor or encourage 
different kinds of forum but it comes down to what you, our guests and fellow 
party goers, want.

IRC can be fun, especially for quick answers to easy questions.  It's less 
intellectual than email lists.  Perhaps after all these years of being very 
serious with Xitami it's time to try to get onto bash.org.

OK, I'll join #xitami on irc.freenode.net and follow the discussion 
occasionally.  If the IRC channel seems useful, we'll announce it on 
xitami.com.
