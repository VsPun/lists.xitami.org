<PRE>IRC,  I haven't the foggiest how to use that.  Well I forgot as haven't been 
IRC user in several years... never was fond of it at all,,, maybe if you 
like to read and chat real fast.

If you're taking votes, newsgroups or plain simple message board .. either I 
can appreciate and then eventually maybe I can unsubscribe or  do away with 
receiving the amply replied digest list.
Single mails don't work for me, digest does but it sure takes time to read 
and figure out who said what sometimes.

Mike


PS;  I pray o lord to please give me strength to  forgive the multi message 
forwarders and style sheeter html and text multi posters and I pray for 
their forgiveness from you too O lord for having to read all those virus 
checkers that continually repeat over and over flaunting their cleanliness.  
Please o lord forgive them of their odd ways for they know not what they 
have done.
