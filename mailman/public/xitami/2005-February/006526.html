<PRE>Thanks for all the input.  see [Changing Port 80 (d calif)]

I understood that I am to create two ddns accounts one the main account, 
which I already have
mysite.yi.org

A 2nd account that will have the new port i.e.  mysite.yi.org:9948
The 2nd account is supposed to point to whatever my current dynamic IP : 
9948

Or

mysite.yi.org  &gt;  mysite.yi.org:9948  &gt; dynamicIP:9948

ONLY ONE PROBLEM:  I'm either too stupid to figure out how to set this up 
(most likely) or, yi.org cannot handle domain forwarding of this nature.  (I 
have seen ref. search via google where others mention doing the port forward 
at yi.org.)  I cannot see where I can enter the port, either as part of a 
url=mysite.yi.org:9948, or as part of the IP ie  xxx.xx.xxx.xx:9948  either 
of these entries are not accepted.


So I call out for help one more time.  I have created a sample page of the 
yi.org account management screens.  I would be grateful if someone who 
understands what needs to be done, look at the yi.org admin screens and 
yi.org help.  Then explain to me in (NOT vague) but specific steps, how to 
accomplish the forwarding.

Note the only place I can enter a port is in the URL:  entry = 
mysite.yi.org:9948, but it did not work either.  Unless I'm suppose to put 
something like
mysite.yi.org = mysite.yi.org:9948    which I have not tried, as I can't 
find anything regarding syntax that explains such an entry.

I have emailed yi.org 3 times requesting help, but no joy there.
(The ddns service is free, so I can't complain too loud.)

Again..... any help is sincerely appreciated!
