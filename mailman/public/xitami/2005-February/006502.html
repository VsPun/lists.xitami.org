<PRE>As far as IP routing, I recommend taking a look at www.no-ip.com
With No-ip, you have the basic routing service for $20, and other services
like back-up mx, alternate smtp, and a lot more options. Alternate smtp will
let you send your email to those aol users, backup mx will collect your mail
for up to 5 days if your mail server is down.


Hope this helps,
/David

Hi All

I have been using Xitami in on single PC's and LAN for years. Now I we have
DSL Broad band so and I have decided to try to setup a small web hosting
service. So I'm looking for advice. Here is a list of things I would like to
know.

1) What E-mail Servers would you recommend? Please price under $200 and free
is always good.

2) What Domain name resalers do you recommend?

3) Are there any license fees or taxes?

4) Is there any Errors and Omission (E and O) insurance?

5) Are there any templates for sigh up to create and maintain customer
accounts

Thanks

Jeff McDonald
