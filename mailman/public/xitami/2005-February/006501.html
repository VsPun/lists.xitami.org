<PRE>I didn't see anything on the bellsouth site about bandwidth usage. Since
it's a business account  I'm sure you'll be fine for quite a long time.
Speed will be fine for awhile too. It will take a little longer for users to
pull up a webpage vs being on a T1 or OC3 as in a server farm. Xitami is
pretty fast. The nice thing about DSL is you aren't fighting for bandwidth
with everyone in the neighborhood, unlike cable. I had Time Warner and
everyday about 6pm my connection slowed down to about 56k or at least it
seemed like it. DSL for the most part especially from the phone company
doensn't seem to have a problem.

I hope you're going to upgrade from win98 and either go with win2k, winXP or
win2003. Of course there are other good OS's too.
Ron

My OS is Windows 98.
My DSL is Bellsouth &quot; Business DSL Lite&quot; with a static IP Hosting is
allowed. Speed and band width maybe a problem until i can afford to upgrade
to a faster option.
