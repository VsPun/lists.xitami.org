<PRE>I can tell you I have used Xitami in combination with Mercury mail 
for years on systems from Windows 98 to Server 2003. I still have 
them both running on a Windows 98 system along with Bind to 
provide DNS, Mail and Webservice. Actually Win98 doesn't do to 
bad for this on a small scale. 

Mercury Mail is totally free and good support is available via a 
mailing list with a web archive. Manuals with support are available if 
you want to purchase these. Currently I have Mercury running on 
Win98, XP, 2000 Server and 2003 Server in various configurations.

When we recently registered a new domain we used GoDaddy. I am 
not familiar with a lot of the options, but I am happy with the results 
once I figured out how to get the right settings for our own DNS. It 
was somewhat different than the Network Solutions registration I 
was familiar with when I worked for a local ISP.
