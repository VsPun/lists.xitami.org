<PRE>I expect everyone has there own preferences and I'm no execption. One thing
you didn't mention is whether you are on a windows machine or non-windows. I
am on a Win2k pc.

1. I use 1st Class Mail Server at www.1cis.com  It's very easy to use. You
can pay for the domain email as you need them at $65 per domain.
2. look at AIT for domain registration $7.95 per domain I don't think can be
beat. I am a domain reseller but I don't have everything set up just yet.
3. Except for ths software you use, you need to check with your State, to
see if there is any kind of fee. I don't believe there are but you never
know.
4. I'm not sure what that would be? Someone else would have to answer that.
5. Templates, depends on what you want to spend, whether you want to auto
generate certain tasks.

And as someone else said, you need to check your DSL TOS. Know even though
they may have a clause forbidding it, you would probably be fine until your
bandwidth got very high.

Also you have to think about whether your DSL company will give you a static
IP. If not you will have to use a dynamic IP updating service like DNS2GO or
GO2MYDNS. I use both one is a back up of the other. I plan to move to a
business DSL account in the future which will allow the traffic and give me
a static IP. And if you are on a Dynamic IP none of your websites will be
able to send email to AOL customers.

Hi All

I have been using Xitami in on single PC's and LAN for years. Now I we have
DSL Broad band so and I have decided to try to setup a small web hosting
service. So I'm looking for advice. Here is a list of things I would like to
know.

1) What E-mail Servers would you recommend? Please price under $200 and free
is always good.

2) What Domain name resalers do you recommend?

3) Are there any license fees or taxes?

4) Is there any Errors and Omission (E and O) insurance?

5) Are there any templates for sigh up to create and maintain customer
accounts

Thanks

Jeff McDonald
