<PRE>Hi.  I'm new to Xitami.

I'm having problems with XML files, and found the following in the archive here.

ello Francis,

Saturday, September 29, 2001, 5:21:55 PM, you wrote:

FT&gt; You need to modify the httpdir.gsl (or better copy it, modify the copy
FT&gt; and use the copy instead of the original) in the templates directory.

FT&gt; Line 89 is in the original form:

FT&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;$(urlbase:)$(nameurl:)&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;$(icon)&quot; 
BORDER=0&gt;&gt;$(name:)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;

FT&gt; You should change this to :

FT&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;$(urlbase:)$(name:)&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;$(icon)&quot; 
BORDER=0&gt;$(name:)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;

Francis,

Thanks! This actually works!

Just as Rod and David I had installed PHP and had the same problem as
they described and this is now fixed!

FT&gt; Personally I think this is the correct behaviour. Nameurl seems to be a
FT&gt; bit too escaped to be useful for anything

I would suggest that in the original distribution line 89 in the
httpdir.gsl is changed too.
This  will  prevent  problems  for other new Xitami/Windows/PHP users.
(Yes,  we  do  exist,  first  we discovered ASP, than PHP...eventually
we'll probably discover linux as well ;-)).

FT&gt; Francis

Unfortunately I tried this and while everyone else in that thread said it worked for that 
problem, it is not working for me.  I still get &quot;The URL you asked for does not exist on 
this website&quot; when I try to go to an XML file.

Can anyone help with this any further?
