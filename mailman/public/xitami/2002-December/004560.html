Subject: [Xitami] Xitami Crashing - Read This - A workaround


&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been using the program version (2.5b4) of Xitami for 3 months now
</I>on
&gt;<i> a Win2k Professional system.  I think it's a really great product,
</I>however,
&gt;<i> about once every 2 weeks, it crashes.  I have found that the auto-crash
</I>&gt;<i> recovery option in Xitami is not reliable.  Auto crash recovery only ever
</I>&gt;<i> worked once.  In all other cases, Xitami just crashed and went away for
</I>&gt;<i> good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a clean win2k prof system with all up to date OS service releases
</I>and
&gt;<i> security patches.  I run a simple web site consisting of HTML pages only,
</I>&gt;<i> nothing fancy.  Since October, Xitami has crashed about 6 times.  After
</I>&gt;<i> reviewing all the debug and log files, I cannot find anything definitive
</I>or
&gt;<i> consistent that causes the crashes.  The only thing I ever saw in a log
</I>file
&gt;<i> was an Xitami log entry saying something like &quot;Event - Sending Event to
</I>Self
&gt;<i> Error&quot; or something like that.  I have seen this a few times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most recent crash was today.  After reviewing all logs and debug files
</I>&gt;<i> (not just Xitami logs), it happened while no one was at the site.  My
</I>Router
&gt;<i> logs confirm this.  Xitami just crashed (access violation) while idling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have found an excellent program called &quot;Watch Dog - O - Matic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> that I use to monitor Xitami and my FTP server software.  If Xitami
</I>crashes
&gt;<i> then &quot;Watch Dog - O - Matic&quot; detects that and then restarts Xitami.  It
</I>&gt;<i> actually worked for me just today.  The Watch Dog program detected that
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami encountered a fatal access violation and then restarted Xitami all
</I>by
&gt;<i> itself.  It worked wonderfully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that the name of the program sounds silly, but, after testing it,
</I>the
&gt;<i> product really does work.  I tested both the free trial version and the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Professional&quot; version.  I found that the free trial version didn't work
</I>&gt;<i> that well, but the professional version really works well and seems very
</I>&gt;<i> reliable.  The professional version cost me 30 dollars U.S.  It seems to
</I>&gt;<i> work well, comes with decent documentation, and can be downloaded right
</I>&gt;<i> away.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>an
&gt;<i> article and a web link to the site that has this program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this helps.
