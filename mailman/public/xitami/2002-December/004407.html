<PRE>&gt;<i> the way this thing works is there are some config folders I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want people monkeying around with located under IlohaMail,
</I>
1) Use Apache. Apache's &quot;alias&quot; is -much- more powerful than
Xitami's. Iloha took advantage of Apache's power, but that leaves
non-Apache users in a bind. FWIW, you can run Xitami and Apache on
the same machine, with different port or IP numbers. I have a
PPro-200 hosting about four different web-servers as well as email
and streaming audio.

2) Wait for the &quot;configurable folders&quot; &quot;bug&quot; on IlohaMail's buglist
to be resolved. There is no reason the app can't keep the public
pages in the public folders and the secret files in non-public
space. But he didn't. He should and it is on his buglist. (And his
code is very well commented. It might be trivial to add folder-opts
and give it to the Iloha community.)

3) Leave the config files out in the open. Surely you don't give
strangers write-permission. Reading is a modest security risk. Yes,
it keeps passwords but not as plaintext: $passkey=&quot;6FMKHnEBylfEYg&quot;
email_address:cKJlzWRAcmNpQnJ1cGdlcnMuZWR2 I have not studied what
happens when you use POP Cache-- that might leave messages out in
the open.

4) use the DataBase option. If I understand that, all user-secrets
are then held out in a SQL database with the usual protections.
