</I>I have crashed Xitami fairly frequently on Win2k.  With V 2.5b5 there is
seems to be a memory management bug where it appears to fail to cope
gracefully when it can't get any more mmory. I don't know all the
circumstances behind this bug and I can't realy be bothered to debug it
(though it seems that the XML processing suffers most from the bug) as I
have a perfectly good work around. The work around is to not use Xitami
on a mahine which uses a lot of memory for other things - or if you do
to expect occasional crashes so automatically restart when required.

I have found that on the whole Xitami uses LESS memory than Apache and
to be at least as fast for static pages (CGI handling is slwer than
Apache with mod_perl but simiar to Apache without). But when Xitami
really wants more memory the computer had best be able to give it some
so running memroy hogging applications like Microsoft Office products is
to be avoided!
