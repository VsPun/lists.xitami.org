<PRE>Hi All,

I have been using the program version (2.5b4) of Xitami for 3 months now on
a Win2k Professional system.  I think it's a really great product, however,
about once every 2 weeks, it crashes.  I have found that the auto-crash
recovery option in Xitami is not reliable.  Auto crash recovery only ever
worked once.  In all other cases, Xitami just crashed and went away for
good.

I have a clean win2k prof system with all up to date OS service releases and
security patches.  I run a simple web site consisting of HTML pages only,
nothing fancy.  Since October, Xitami has crashed about 6 times.  After
reviewing all the debug and log files, I cannot find anything definitive or
consistent that causes the crashes.  The only thing I ever saw in a log file
was an Xitami log entry saying something like &quot;Event - Sending Event to Self
Error&quot; or something like that.  I have seen this a few times.

The most recent crash was today.  After reviewing all logs and debug files
(not just Xitami logs), it happened while no one was at the site.  My Router
logs confirm this.  Xitami just crashed (access violation) while idling.

However, I have found an excellent program called &quot;Watch Dog - O - Matic&quot;
that I use to monitor Xitami and my FTP server software.  If Xitami crashes
then &quot;Watch Dog - O - Matic&quot; detects that and then restarts Xitami.  It
actually worked for me just today.  The Watch Dog program detected that
Xitami encountered a fatal access violation and then restarted Xitami all by
itself.  It worked wonderfully.

I know that the name of the program sounds silly, but, after testing it, the
product really does work.  I tested both the free trial version and the
&quot;Professional&quot; version.  I found that the free trial version didn't work
that well, but the professional version really works well and seems very
reliable.  The professional version cost me 30 dollars U.S.  It seems to
work well, comes with decent documentation, and can be downloaded right
away.

article and a web link to the site that has this program.

I hope this helps.
