<PRE>Yet another newbie raises his innocent head.....

Hi,

I have been &quot;volunteered&quot; at work to get a linux box up and running with
Samba, Tight VNC, ARKEIA Tape Server, and of course, Xitami. I have read so
much &quot;geek-speak&quot; documentation it's hard to remember what option is for
what server! (There... I feel better now!)

Is there a generic &quot;Start / Kill&quot; script out there that someone can point me
to, so that if I need to use VNC to cause the box to reboot, Xitami will
start similar to SMB or HTTPD on the way up? I'm willing to try my hand at
editing a workable script, but I'm not &quot;there&quot; yet when it comes to writing
things from scratch. Of course, if someone has tips and hints as to how to
make Xitami start at boot without adding a Start script, that would be very
cool! At the moment, I log in as the user that installed Xitami and cd to
the directory it's in, and manually kick off xitami -b 5000 -s.

To recap: I need to have Xitami start as a service in run command levels 2-5
as the machine boots.

Thanks for any and all support!
