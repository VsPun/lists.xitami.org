&gt;<i> Then you can use a little Proxy as ANALOGX `s to acces the internet.
</I>
Big warning to anyone thinking of using AnalogX proxy: at one time, this
was distributed such that the default configuration would allow an open
SOCKS proxy; many people have found to their cost that their computer was
being hijacked to relay spam/UCE by news and e-mail --- the first they
would know was when their ISP would cut them off for misusing the
service.

The author seemed quite unconcerned about this, and had no means of
contacting the thousands of users that already had this product and were
vulnerable.  I hope by now that the documentation has been made clearer,
and that the default configuration does not include the open SOCKS.  All
the same, current and potential future users are urged to check that
their systems are not acting as wormholes for the spammers!

    &quot;We can no longer stand apart from Europe if we would.  Yet we are
    untrained to mix with our neighbours, or even talk to them&quot;.
