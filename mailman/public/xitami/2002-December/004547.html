Then you must be a supreme fsckwit, mustn't you?  A pointer to the
instructions is included in the trailer to each and every posting:
indeed, you even [over]quoted one in your reply; and the list server
added another.

I've snipped those, but nevertheless the server will add the URL to this
post as well: so why not try following the URL and the instructions to
which it leads?

The headers of each message also contain considerable detail about how to
subscribe and unsubscribe.  Since you're using Pukeout Excess, I presume
that you're blissfully unaware that these headers exist, so I'll quote
one &lt;mailto:<A HREF="mailto:xitami-request@lists.xitami.org">xitami-request@lists.xitami.org</A>?subject=unsubscribe&gt; here.

[You must, of course, issue the unsubscribe instructions from the mail
account which has been subscribed to the list.  I doubt that you're
sophisticated enough to be receiving the posts because you originally
subscribed from a different address and have since set up mail forwarding
to your current one, but mention it in case that's the cause.]

    &quot;We can no longer stand apart from Europe if we would.  Yet we are
    untrained to mix with our neighbours, or even talk to them&quot;.
