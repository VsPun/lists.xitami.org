&gt;<i> Sadly enuff you are so detailed on every one elses post and you were not
</I>&gt;<i> even considerate enuff to mark yours OT so we don't have to read useless
</I>&gt;<i> posts! I thought you were looking to save bytes! How bout saving ours!
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you should critic all the spelling too...
</I>&gt;<i> Dude do you think some of the users in here even know what you are even
</I>&gt;<i> talking about or care for that matter...
</I>&gt;<i> Do you really need to be this critical. I mean come on! Get a life....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to all offended. I just had to let it out !
</I>
========&gt; well did you have to let it out in here?  good lord, where's the
lysol!
(jk)..

also.. i think you meant 'critique'.. but, no matter.  and no, i'm not being
a smartass, or anything even remotely close. i read this, and have read lots
of other stuff like it and i can't help thinking;  LIFE'S TOO SHORT!

i wonder, and am always amazed at how most people will find the silliest
things to worry and bitch about. especially when there's allot more to worry
about. like for instance..  this country has gone to hell, and we're about 3
months from a 'depression' not just 'recession' as we're in now.  and, on
top of all that, we're about to get blown off the map because all somebody
can say is &quot;my daddy started a war, so i can start several&quot;....

put your priorities where they belong people. use your energy to think about
ways to do something about our gestapo-government..
