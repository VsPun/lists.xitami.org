<PRE>Okay, I won't quote the other comments from various people. I have installed
Xitami on Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, and XP and interfaced with Microsoft
Access, a mail server, and an FTP server, as well as PHP. I have NEVER, EVER
had Xitami crash on it's own. When I've had crashes, it was due to other
things that I quickly fixed. I also use Norton Disk Doctor, Windoctor, and
Speeddisk. I also use Easy Cleaner and Reg Cleaner to keep the registry
tidy. Last but not least, I use Evidence Eliminator to wipe out all the
extra trash in the Registry. Using all this, prior to even working with
Xitami, prevents any crashes from occurring in the first place.

Okay, maybe it's overkill, but I sincerely believe that the REGISTRY is the
cause of crashes.
