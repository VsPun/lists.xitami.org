I had a real bear of a time getting 2.5c1 (or 2.4d10) to build from
source.  Apparently the Windows versions work just great for everybody,
but when I picked up the source tree there were several problems that
prevented it from compiling (at least under linux).


As far as I know, you shouldn't need the rbase stuff to build xitami -
the source tree comes with the stuff that it appears to need (smt, sfl,
etc.) ... though if you do need rbase then that would explain a little.
There's no mention of rbase on xitami.com, but then xitami.com doesn't
really reflect the current state of the product so it's not a good
reference.

First step, do a 'find' in the source tree to see if you have a file
called &quot;c&quot; in each subdirectory ... if you don't, you can get a copy from
<A HREF="http://eep.burdell.org/c">http://eep.burdell.org/c</A> which (I think) is edited a bit so that it
actually works.

Then make the build.sh script executable (it also helps on some systems
to add #!/bin/bash to the first line) and give it a run and see where
you get.
