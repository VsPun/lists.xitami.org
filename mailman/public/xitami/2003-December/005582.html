Xitami/Pro does not allow this separation per protocol, but it does 
let you do much the same thing using virtual hosts.  Since HTTPS is 
bound to an IP address, not a server name, use the default 
configuration for your secure information.  Then add a virtual host 
for your insecure data.

When people come in on the secure connection they will use the 
default configuration.  When people use the insecure connection they 
will use the virtual host configuration.

There is one flaw in this plan: if someone enters the IP address they 
will be sent to the secure data.  This may or may not be a problem 
for you, since HTTPS is not protecting your data so much as allowing 
your users be certain it is coming from you.

There may be other ways to do this, and there are certainly ways to 
make more complex access controls using scripts (which can check and 
switch the HTTP protocol between secure and insecure).
