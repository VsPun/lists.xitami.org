<PRE>Hi there!

I'd like to [have a friend] use Xitami/Pro to serve up some stuff 
over https.

I find myself going completely bonkers over this one: how to divide 
between the HTTP content and the HTTPS content? Nothing I found stops 
Xitami from happily serving up the sensitive stuff over HTTP _as well 
as_ over HTTPS!  :-/

In other words: I want to serve from two subfolders in /webpages: 
/http &amp; /https, Xitami chosing between the two, based on the protocol 
use by the client.

Must be some incongruity between Xitami's and my philosophy (I find 
it completely trivial in apache.) Surely this is some simple option I 
overlooked in the online docs?

regards &amp; cheers anyway - for a great httpserver

Ferenc
