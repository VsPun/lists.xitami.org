<PRE>further to the report below I've done some tests and here is a new full 
report:

updated two of my servers (Win 2000) a few days ago to Xitami 2.5c0 from 
2.4.d9

I didn't find any real problems (apart from the fact that the exe's had 
changed names - including the one that runs the service).

But yesterday I realised that the way it handles PHP pages has changed 
completely. The server now sends the wrong headers as all my dynamic PHP 
pages are being cached on all platforms and all clients!!!

So I did a header check and 2.5c0 is passing the modified date of the
actual raw php file in the Last-modified: header as if it were an html
file.

This can't be right, can it?!!!
Presumably 2.4.d9 didn't do this?

Adding a line:

Last-modified: etc...

to .\headers\header.php doesn't help in any way

and adding:

header (&quot;Last-Modified: Mon, 30 May 2003 00:00:00 GMT&quot;);

to the start of a php file as a test makes no difference either. It's 
still the modified date of the actual raw php file thats passed in the 
header.

Help!!!!
