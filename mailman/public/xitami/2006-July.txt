Subject: [Xitami] I just Lost my abitly to run Scripts.
Message-ID: <003901c6b3a7$a4c19c20$6801a8c0@earthlink.net>

I am running: Xitiami v2.4d9 
on Win 98
I am using Purl (can't give you the version because of this problem? I think its 6)

So Story,
I have been running this set up for a couple of years and it has worked perfectly, no problems.
then a few days ago I was testing an old script I had written (on this same system) that lets the user upload files to a server, but the length of the files were 0bits even though this had worked fine before. But that not the real Problem.

The Real Problem happened today!
The Server has stopped running any of my purl scripts. and for no reason, I almost never touch anything in the control panel and have not even opened it for atleast a year. I have check perl and it dos run from Dos. I have re-installed xitami Raw, I can log onto its Control panel, I can open HTML pages in the CGI-BIN directory though the server. But when I submit something that worked Yesterday (or was written over a Year ago) I get the standard (500 Can't find File Error) and it comes up really fast. Hear are some stuff from the Logs 

example: log_in.html call acount_prosser.pl using get method.

request.log
GET /cgi-bin/nlcart/underground_a/accounts_panel/acount_prosser.pl?log_username=a&log_password=a&B1=Log+In&pageid=login HTTP/1.1
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-shockwave-flash, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/msword, */*
Referer: http://localhost\cgi-bin\nlcart\underground_a\accounts_panel\log_in.html
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)
Host: localhost
Connection: Keep-Alive
Authorization: Basic bm9ubGluOmdvZm9ydGg=


Header.log
HTTP/1.0 500 Internal error
Server: Xitami
Content-Length: 159
Content-Type: text/html

<HTML><TITLE>Error</TITLE><BODY><H1>

The function you requested is not implemented

<BR>Cannot create CGI process - program not found</H1></BODY></HTML>



Someone Please get back to me because I am really Stuck.

Subject: [Xitami] can't view webpages over the internet
Message-ID: <BAY124-W377947126BAAD5DD249A8E85C0@phx.gbl>

I was just wondering if anyone could help me set up the xitami so that people can view my webpages over the internet...I can view them but no one else can.....I pinged the I.P. address and everything was ok...but I couldn't really use the telnet 80 command....wasn't quite sure what to do...and also when I set xitami to run it suddenly stops like almost straight after...and no error message like can't find webpages pops up so I'm not sure what's wrong there either...can any one offer me any help??
