I've been a long time user of classic Xitami, now I must bid a fond
farewell. The problems I have encountered after upgrading to MS Vista have
been way too painful. My web server seemed to be down more than up. So, I
have moved on to a different web server. The new web server does everything
Xitami did and more (asp) and no it's not Apache.

Yeah I'm not real happy with Vista at least at work because they kept all
the security crap in it. However here on my home system I turned all that
crap off. Vista seems to be pretty stable but Xitami doesn't play real nice.
As a matter of fact Xitami didn't play well with my XP system either. I
stuck with it because I liked the simplicity and I was use to it. I'm sure
it is fine with Linux though but I'm not a Linux person.

I run Xitami v2.4d9 on Windows Server 2003.  It runs stable as hell and I haven't had a crash in...well, at least a year...and I think that was hardware, not Xitami.  In fact, I have never had crash issues with Xitami....just keeps on ticking!

And it still runs pretty fast to.  My site is pretty much all dynamic content site, currently pumps about 12Gb and 25,000 hits per day...it takes about 4 seconds to load the slowest page.  Now granted, i have had to some trickery to get a few things to work like modern web servers.  I don't know what the limits of the site will be, but so far its not even close to being bogged down.

The biggest trick I had to do was my own version of URL rewrite.  Manually create a URL name for every category/forum title on my site, stored to a DB.  Then use CGI alias to assign names to specific scripts

CGI Alias:  
   /ads = /cgi-bin/postlist.pl
   /ad = /cgi-bin/postShow.pl

DB URL Mapping:
   categoryID 3 = 'for-sale'
   forumID 26 = "cars'

Build URL:
   /ad/for-sale/cars/this-is-the-article-subject-line/0_12345.html
   0_12345.html = (0=pageID, 12345= articleID)

Then parse $ENV, which is the remainder of the url path after the cgi alias ("/ad"), to decode the incoming URL and translate it back into meaningful DB recordIDs.

Fun stuff.  But it works pretty clean.    Only had to create about 16 cgi alias, everything else is in the DB.
