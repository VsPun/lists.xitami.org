<PRE>Sorry to have missed your earlier emails.  Xitami is GPLd and you can
redistribute it freely under this license. So, yes, you can package it with
your product but you do not need our explicit permission for that.

Glad to hear Xitami is still useful.

Dear Sir,
thank you very much for your reply.

My name is Faik Djikic and I'm the author of the server-side scripting tool
WhizBase. Our tool is a hypertext preprocessor (for detailed information
I'll send you an URL - I do not want to spam the list), and by its nature it
requires web server to run. It works perfectly with Windows version of
Xitami 2.5 (actually I've tested it with version 2.5c2), but there are few
problems with instructing our users (and specially trial users) to install
it themselves:

1. I do not know where installation package can be found (downloaded)

2. My users are true beginners in web development and installing IIS that
they get with Vista or Windows 7 is a rocket science for them (It's not a
joke, our software is truly simple and efficient and it also includes free
wizard style tool for publishing the database using WhizBase, so they can
use Whizbase but can not do the web server setup). Downloading Xitami and
modifying xitami.cfg is mission impossible for most of them.

3. Most of them do not know why they need a local web server, so it's not
likely they will bother to download and install local web server, they will
rather say that my product does not work for them give up trying (there's
nothing to start from start menu without web server)

What I want to do is to include just basic Xitami files in our setup
package, install it silently (if user selects &quot;Development files&quot;
installation package) create small exe that will start Xitami when user
wants to see the examples or when he wants to use wizards, and that also
will stop the Xitami when user closes the browser or wizards. So they would
be using Xitami web server but they would not be installing it separately.

We would not modify xigui32.exe in any way and beside that file
(xigui32.exe) we would distribute only xitami.cfg and xitami.aut.

So, my question is - can we have your official permission to do that.

Our software is a commercial solution (not GPL) but it is by default
registered (free) for use on non-profit domains: *.org, *.edu, *.org.xx and
*.edu.xx  (international and national org and edu domains).

Thank you for taking the time to read my mail and consider our request.
