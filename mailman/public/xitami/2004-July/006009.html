<PRE>Hello Group!

I am a new member of this group, and would like to say hello to everyone
right here; but I am using Xitami WebServer since the first release version,
and I really do like it. But I am having one big problem:

I am running Xitami WebServer version 2.5c1 on an Windows 2000 machine with
an ADSL-Connection (5MBit/s - ~1M/Bit/s). All was wonderful until
yesterday...I was at work and tried to connect to my server (located at
home) to download a PDF-Document. After r.a. 32KBytes Xitami stopped the
transfer and I got only a broken file. I tested around with other big files
and everytime I got the same problem. Then I tested my email-server and sent
these big files to my company email address and this worked fine.

So, I guess this problem is on Xitami and/or my configurations, which
mostely are all on default-settings. As I already said, the connection
itself is okay but Xitami stops sending datas above ~32KB.

If anyone has an idea how I can fix this problem, please help me.

So far, thank you very much, and...
....have a mice day :)
