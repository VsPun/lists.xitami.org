I have windows 2000 and set it up without any problem on default. My IP set
on default "*". Did not encouter any errors at all. Your question was quite
vauge. Were you able to get up the web based interface? or does site show up
via local host? What I found out was that my ISP blocked port 80 the hard
way. I uninstalled everything including firewalls and stuff and still didn't
work. But found out it was my damn ISP blocked port 80. I changed the port
setting to different port and it worked fine. Heres a cool too to check what
port your ISP blocks www.portdetective.com if that is the problem. Good
luck.

No problem. I do have a question for the list. I have ALOT of perl programs
running using Active State's ACTIVE PERL www.activeperl.com and MySQL and it
works fine with Xitami. Because my programin' skill isn't very efficient my
scripts uses so it uses quite a bit of proccessor power. Anyone know that if
Active States' PerlEX (It's like PERLMOD for Apache) works with Xitami? It
doesn't list it as one of the servers. If anyone knows, please help. Thanks.

Hello all,

Do any xitami-log-examening tools exist?

I now think of: Processing the access log and showing statistics for:
-How many IP's have connected to the webserver last week/day
-What has been the busiest day this week / busiest hour last day
etc.

Or do we all simply use stuff like stats4all, netstat etc?

Dear Craig,

looks extremely good, but analog quircks about the logformat?

What I did now was edit analog.cfg and tell analog where my logfiles
are and what the output should be:
==
LOGFILE \\server\c\xitami\logs\ac*.*
OUTFILE \\server\c\inetpub\wwwroot\analogreport.html
==

This seems to work. That is, analog tries processing the log-files.

But analog tells me:
==
  logfile \\server\c\xitami\logs\ac011122.log: turn debugging on or try
  different LOGFORMAT
    Current logfile format:
      %S %j %j [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j%w%r%wHTTP%j" %c %b "%f" "%B"\n
      %S %j %j [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%j%w%r" %c %b "%f" "%B"\n
      %S %j %j [%d/%M/%Y:%h:%n:%j] "%r" %c %b "%f" "%B"\n
===

But I have difficulty entering the right format. This is what the
lines look like in my access.log files:

===
213.84.56.202 - - [17/Nov/2001:00:07:28 +0100] "GET /sandston.gif
HTTP/1.1"   200   9706  "http://hace.dyndns.org/diplomacy/dipned.html"
"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)"
===

(this is one entry from the logfile, all on one line)

If you know the right (xitami) LOGFORMAT I should enter for the above
logfile-line I would be very much helped!

[ Later ]

It seems analog did something after all!
Have a look at the results at:
http://hace.dyndns.org/analogreport.html

But then again: How should I disable all the '/script/' logging?
It does not recognize the '404' message, see the following line:

===
62.194.210.43     -     -     [17/Nov/2001:15:27:17     +0100]    "GET
/scripts/..%252f../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir  HTTP/1.0"  404 -1 ""
""
===

Thanks in advance,

True, and other very nice feauturs of analog! Including my own CSS

Subject: [Xitami] somebody using visual basic out there?
Message-ID: <5.0.2.1.2.20011201165821.01c22d00@190.190.190.1>

hello !

i'm using xitami for some months now. i started writing cgi with visual 
basic and it works perfectly (with no knowledge of programming in VB --long 
ago i did some programming in cobol and fortran). Xitami even parses the 
form fields so i don't have to do it myself! (i tried the well-known 
win-cgi.bas but the object code was some 120 kB, but when using only the 
needed statements the object code is only 15..25k)
i'm even writing a complete order administration (written _years_ ago and 
ported from quickbasic).  It can search through 12000 records, send e-mail 
and faxes and generate output in less than a second.

But there is nobody posting messages about VB cgi (indeed it works very 
well so you expect no reclamations and questions). Are some people out 
there also working with VB5.0? (maybe we could start an other mailing list 
so we don't disturb those using PHP...)
I have only one single question, but till now didn't find any answer: can't 
get any file download done. When checking the files on the server just 
after a download i don't find any file that contains anything that was 
downloaded.

You can mail me directly <marc@verfaillie.com>


Thanks,

marc

I'm not sure if this is a factor, because i don't use VB cgi, but since VB
is Microsoft/Windows proprietary, wouldn't the cgi not work in the *nix
versions of Xitami?

Why should i use *nix?
Win'98 SE seems to work quite well on my computer (and there is even a 
complete mailserver (Mercury), a virus scanner (MailScan) and a scheduler 
running, and sometimes a mail client (Eudora)). I have a permanent dsl 
connection with fixed ip (upload 12kbytes/sec download 80kbytes/sec), and 
no problem ever. Xitami serves as internet server <web.verfaillie.com> and 
intranet server. Only the virus scanner slows the system down when mail is 
arriving.
I tried some unix flavor years ago, but it's command shell is so completely 
different of DOS that my fingers felt of my hands and i reverted to 
dos/windows.

well, for one thing, *nix is much stabler that windows.  Also, i don't quite
see why you were using the console, when there was the X Window system.  You
should have been using KDE or Gnome - possibly windowmaker or some others.

You might have better luck asking here:

While not VB specific, this group does center around CGI in general.

I'm sure that Ewen will step in eventually, however, I feel the need to say
this..

This is not the forum for trying to convert someone from operating system to
another.

The original poster was asking for help for a particular situation. Your
response provided no help for his query. Suggesting that he switch to another
operating system was a fruitless effort.

While I can understand your enthusiasm for *nix based platforms, this is not
the place for it. If you can't offer meaningful help in regards to the context
of the questions asked, please refrain from posting. Doing otherwise serves no
purpose other than to drive those who are honestly looking for a helping hand
else where.

When you say file download exactly what do you mean? Are you trying to 
send a fiel to a clients browser from your server or the reverse (upload 
a file from the borwser to the server)? or soemthing else?

I seem to recall a problem with VB and multipart encoded posts - which 
is what you you have if you want a user to upload a file to your server 
but I can't rememebr the details

maybe you didn't get my whole message...

the one before that was about if the VB cgi would work in the *nix platforms
of Xitami, since VB is microsoft/windows proprietary.  I wasn't trying to
convert anybody.

Thank you Ewen, I firmly agree with your post.  Although I agree that *nix
based server is superior to a win9x server, I still use Windows ME with
Xitami.  I host my site off of the same machine that i use as a Digtal Audio
Workstation (bad idea, I know, but that is the way it will be for a while).
And although *nix is making progress in the professional audio world, it
still has a while before catching up to the compatibilty of the 9x world.

I am genuinely interested in valid responses to the original question of
this thread.  I am a programmer by trade, and although I deal in proprietary
languages now professionally, I am still familiar with languages such as VB,
and would be interested in developing CGI in this language.

Please do not flame someone for not complying with your standards. That not
only discourages the user who created the original question, but it also
limits actual valid responses, and further valid questions due to fear of
fire as well.


Sincerely,

Jay Aldrich

Marc,
Last spring I used VB/Xitami for one of the classes I teach.  The students
build web pages and wrote VB 6.0 cgi scripts to update an Access database.
I'll have to go back and refresh my memory on how we handled files, since
I havn't touched the code since June.

When you said you had trouble downloading files, how were you doing it?

I'm using a private ISP DSL called DSLEXTREME that leases from PacBell SBC.
I pay 49/mo for standard DSL access for one static ISP, and $8/mo each for

>  i started writing cgi with visual basic

I would have expected you to get razzed on that point: "You
program in BASIC? Yuck!", rather than the non-unix point. Even
FORTRAN gets more respect than BASIC. 

I'd argue that *nix is NOT universally "more stable"... but this
isn't the place. 

Using MS Basic "prevents" you from porting to non-MS platforms,
which isn't much of an issue for me. I have stable MS machines.
If I had to move to a commercial hosting site, most assume unix
but plenty of NT hosts are available. 

Yes, I too program in BASIC, when nobody is watching. I have a VB
filter serving many pages on my site from a database. And because
I am a really crude guy, I also have a QuickBasic 4.5 (1985 DOS
tool) CGI handling forms. Hey: it works, I understand it; what
more could I want? 

>From one Basic-user to another: once you get over Perl's chaos,
it ain't as bad as it looks. I have 21 years experience in BASIC,
I spent a month part-time writing my VB filter. After a month of
poking at Perl trying to get a handle on it, I did more in one
day than I did in a month with VB. Some things are still better
in VB-- nobody's string functions compare with MS BASIC. But many
things web-related are pre-made in Perl. 

>  the object code was some 120 kB, but when using only the 
needed statements the object code is only 15..25k

One think I learned in years of QB programming, and the same is
true in VB: the object code size is meaningless. The compiler is
pretty sloppy. Much of that "excess" code won't be used. And even
more so in VB, where ANY program loads and initializes a 2 Meg
library, which dwarfs the code you or I will write. (Perl does
the same thing, only differently.) If your code reads better with
(or without) some function or module, do it regardless of how big
the BIN or EXE file comes out. 

>  It can search through 12000 records, send e-mail and faxes and generate output in less than a second.

My VB filter does a very dumb sequential search on a flat text
file and can pull 1,000 hits in less than a second on P-350. Some
things in VB are slow (case-sensitive text match) but most things
are bound by disk and network speed, not program speed. A rough
comparison with old QB45 (which ran well on 8088-5 machines)
shows little difference. 

Your question may be about VB but it probably is really about CGI
or Xitami's interface to CGI, which IS on-point on this list. 

>  can't get any file download done. When checking the files on the server just after a download i don't find any file 

Without details of what you mean "download" I can't begin to
think where to look. Do you really mean "upload"? What HTML code
do you use in the form? Does your VB code believe it has handled
a file? 

> Xitami even parses the form fields so i don't have to do it myself!

Yes, but MultiPartEncoded is a bit tricky. 

This is one place where I'd be inclined to use Perl. BASIC/VB's
notion of STDIN and STDOUT is a bit arcane... well to be frank,
it isn't like unix and CGI assumes that kind of input stream.
Perl has modules, or you can find pre-made File UpLoad Perl
scripts. Since form-upload really does not have to interface
directly with your VB code, it should not interfere. 

And BTW: I would have written that VB filter in QB; in fact I
prototyped it in QB. The thing that "forced" me to VB is QB45's
64K limit on string-space. I could have worked-around, but I was
attracted to the "infinite" heap in VB-Win.

I have cable-modem access here in the Netherlands.

Before August, the provider was the Finnish Telecom company 'Sonera'.
We had no possibility for running servers because they locked out all
incoming requests on ports 1-1024 (apart from certain necessary secure
ports or something). It was 79 Guilders (EUR 36) a month.

Currently Sonera has sold the Cable over here to UPC, so now I have
Chello (see www.chello.nl) for 99 Guilders (EUR 45) a month and can
run a HTTP server (yes!).

Hello from Belgium

Thank you all for your replies (to the list and to me personally).
I will definitely try power basic from powerbasic.com (the console version) 
since i don't need an interface when sending html output to another 
computer. _visual_ basic is too much for me.


I will define my problem more specifically:
The company i work for has an internet printer (Remote Internet Printing). 
It reads it's mail via pop-3 like an ordinary mail client and prints it 
out. It works perfectly for text documents.

The printer can also print postscript files, but it can't handle mime. A 
postcript file attached to a message is mime-encoded, but the printer can't 
decode it (and there is no upgrade). Printing postcript to the LAN printer 
is OK (windows file and printer sharing).


So i want to get the postcript file from the remote user using http
Once the file is on the server computer i can do anything to adapt the 
message to the printer standards and send it without mime to the printer 
mailbox.

I tried following html to send a sample file
<html><body>

    <form ACTION="/cgi-bin/env.exe" method="POST">
       <input type=file name="123.txt"><br>
       <input type=submit value="Send">
    </form>

</body></html>

env.exe simply sends the environment and other input files back to the browser.

What i get on the server is the name of the file, but not the content itself!
Is there something wrong with the html (i don't think so)?

That's what the back-end program receives from Xitami (the environment).

I don't know if the problem is html-related (wrong coding of html),

Hello from Belgium<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your replies (to the list and to me personally).<br>
I will definitely try power basic from powerbasic.com (the console
version) since i don't need an interface when sending html output to
another computer. _visual_ basic is too much for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will define my problem more specifically:<br>
The company i work for has an internet printer (Remote Internet
Printing). It reads it's mail via pop-3 like an ordinary mail client and
prints it out. It works perfectly for text documents.<br>
<br>
The printer can also print postscript files, but it can't handle mime. A
postcript file attached to a message is mime-encoded, but the printer
can't decode it (and there is no upgrade). Printing postcript to the LAN
printer is OK (windows file and printer sharing).<br>
<br>
<br>
So i want to get the postcript file from the remote user using http<br>
Once the file is on the server computer i can do anything to adapt the
message to the printer standards and send it without mime to the printer
mailbox.<br>
<br>
I tried following html to send a sample file<br>
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;form ACTION=&quot;/cgi-bin/env.exe&quot;
method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;input type=file
name=&quot;123.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;input type=submit
value=&quot;Send&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/form&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br>
<br>
env.exe simply sends the environment and other input files back to the
browser.<br>
<br>
What i get on the server is the name of the file, but not the content
itself!<br>
Is there something wrong with the html (i don't think so)?<br>
<br>
That's what the back-end program receives from Xitami (the
environment).<br>

That should of course be without the ||s which mozilla kindly inserted

Wow,   QuickBasic!!!

I for one am impressed.  I use VB4 and can do virtually
anything I can imagine.  Been using it successfully
writing CGI programs (now as filters for indexing crawlers)
under Xitami since 1996.

I used to want to use *nix because of portability over platforms
for increased computing power. But I've limited time and resources 
to tackle the task at hand. To say nothing of learning *nix on my 
own.  Time's carrying on. 

When I  development on a P200 machine, then moving the filters to 
faster machines,  over 10x in just clock speed, computing speed to 
the user across the net ceases to be an issue.

Cheers,

Wes

Yes, there is something more that has to happen in a POST transaction if
you have a file upload involved. But I can't remember what....

An interesting product. Amazing that he has kept it going for 2 decades
against Mighty MicroSoft. 

>  an internet printer... It reads its mail via pop-3 like an ordinary mail client and prints it out. 

An interesting way to print. I have printers where if you do an FTP STOR
to them, they "store" the file as ink on paper. 

Never heard of one with an email interface, but that would be convenient
for many people. 

Is the printer itself getting mail from the POP mailbox, or are you
using a DOS/Win machine to get mail and give it to the printer? 

>  can also print postscript files, 

OK, it is a PS printer that can auto-switch from text to PostScript. 

> but it can't handle mime. 

Ah. If you are using a PC to get mail and send it to the printer, there
are standalone command-line MIME decoders. Most are very smart: you can
send them plain un-MIME text and they will give it back unchanged. One
old favorite is UUDECODE.

So after you get email from the POP server and put it in a file, use
SHELL to pass the file through a decoder

 Folder$ = "C:\spool\mail\"
 MessageNumber$ = "1234"
 InFile$ = MessageNumber$ + ".bin"
 OutFile$ = MessageNumber$ + ".txt"
 SHELL "command /c UUDECODE <" + Infile$ + " >" + Outfile$
 SHELL "command /c copy " + OutFile$ + " PRN"

I was the one that asked about PerlEX. I got ActivePerl running... but when
I tried to install the PerlEX, it would not install saying it needed a
particular server. Anyone  got any ideas about making ActivePerl more
efficient besides PerlEX with Xitami? I looked into the LWRP... but it looks
really complicated... I need something that would work with the scripts that
I already have without making too many changes. Something like ModPerl for
Apache. Any ideas?

It's a Phaser 840 and it has _ALSO_ ftp, but i can't use it since ftp 
requests are handled by Xitami and i have only ONE ip address: so local ftp 
to the printer works correcly, but when i connect from the outside world to 
the company's lan it's Xitami that handles the requests. The isp's NAT 
sends http request to one local ip, ftp to another (or the same) ip, smtp 
to a third, and so on). I don't know if there is a way to (re)direct 
request from xitami to the printer.
btw, the new phaser 850 can handle mime.

>Is the printer itself getting mail from the POP mailbox, or are you

It's a real RIP printer that reads a pop-3 mailbox. It has also something 
called IPP (internet printing protocol, sort of a web-like interface) but 
my isp prohibits using the IPP port :-((

Thank you for your comments on mime-decoding.
I was planning to write one by myself but since somebody else has already 
done it ...

Hello
I have a quick question for you that I don't see in the docs anywhere.
Can you use any other type of password file/type encryption with this
server, as
example I currently use the sambar server and I have a choice of encryption
methods, crypt - apache, sacrypt - sambar, MD5 - universal. These can be
implemented via .htaccess or through the sambar native password system.

Regards
Peter

Not at present, no.  Xitami only supports its niave plain text password
files.

At some stage, probably the same point that it supports encrypted
passwords, it will add support for other authentication formats, maybe
by using PAM where that is available.

Contributions of code to do this welcomed :-)

is used when they are publicly available for use. Perl offers a MD5 mod I
believe that php uses a similar method. PAM I'm not fimilair with. Below is
a bit of perl to encrypt a password (MD5 mod need s to be installed)

use Digest::MD5 qw/md5_hex/;
$enc_pass=md5_hex($password);

Subject: [Xitami] Server side includes and directory listing templates
Message-ID: <002401c17ccd$8d3ed650$0203a8c0@cartman>

Hello,
   In my directory listing template "myhttpdir.gsl" I would like to run have
a server side
that runs a ".exe" on each file with a certain extension. The following
code:
.    if defined (type)
.       if type = "lnk"
.           <!-- #include virtual="/cgi-bin/resolvelnk.exe" -->
.       endif
.endif

Does not run the "resolvelnk" executable.

As you can probable guess I'm try to treat Windows links as close to real
links as possible.  I'm trying
process the link and return text that will give an "a href" link to the
proper directory.

Thanks for any help.

This line does not do what you want it to do.
.           <!-- #include virtual="/cgi-bin/resolvelnk.exe" -->

Firstly it should give an error because <!-- is not a recognised gsl command 

Then if you were to remove the leading . it might at least give a page 
with the cgi-bin line in it but I don't think it would execute it as it 
would be treated as a static html page not a dynamic shtml one.

What you need to do - which is tricky - is to use commands like .literal 
or .xml to load the text and the mangle it but I'm not sure you can do 
what you would want to do (assign a variable to the file contents which 
you would then manipulate with substr)...

Sorry about the typeO.  The code fragment I tried was what I have below.
.    if defined (type)
.       if type = "lnk"
           <!-- #include virtual="/cgi-bin/resolvelnk.exe" -->
.       endif
.endif

And yes, it did include the "<!-- #include ..." in the html text but did not
process it.

Is there a nice document some where where I can see all the gsl commands and
see
what these two do?

See  http://www.imatix.com/html/gslgen/index.htm which also gives you 
the stand alone gslgen progam to play with and test things.

Note that I believe the gslgen version included seems to be very 
slightly different from the standalone version.

Quick (and probably dumb) question.

Does gcc -DDEBUG make a performance difference to Xitami?

I'm assuming it makes some difference and thus would be interested if it 
worth disabling since it seems like this is enabled in src/sfl/c unless 
you enable  set CCDEFINES beforehand

Hi,

	I've experienced 2 cases of CGIs crashing when run behind Xitami, but which
run just fine if I explicitely invoke them from the command-prompt. I run
Windows 2000 Pro, Xitami Win NT service
http://users.skynet.be/sky37432/bs3225b4.exe


	One case is when I use XMLDOM in PHP. Details are at
http://bugs.php.net/?id=13830&edit=2

	The other case is when trying to use the CGI that comes with
http://www.namazu.org/ , I get this in the cgi error log:

abnormal program termination
Assertion failed: 0, file cgi.c, line 240


	It must be some call which fails when running behind XItami, but not when
running from the OS console. Maybe memory allocation ?

	Ideas ? Tips ?

	thanks !

marcio

Hey,
    Ok, I'm not sure if the problem is that the port is being blocked out or
not because on the PC that this is originally setup the port is blocked out
yet the server still works.  I don't go through an ISP.  As a matter of fact
the web is not even setup on this machine, I just use this to run the
server.  I still can't get into the setup and I just don't know what else to
do.  On the win 98 PC that currently have it running when you enter in the
the Xitami Web Server Properties, the IP Address of the machine is entered
into the ip address space, but on this new PC it's not present. I assume
that might be the problem but I cannot get the IP in there.
I could really use some help at this point, my manager is on my back,
thanks.

Open a Command Prompt and try this:

telnet localhost 80 <enter>
GET / <enter>
<enter>


	Does telnet connect to the web server port ? Does the GET fetch the
document back ? Is  it the Xitami page you expect ?

	I've seen people try to install Xitami on a Win2k machine which already had
an IIS server running on port 80. Obviously that fails.

	What exactly are you trying to do ? Force Xitami to bind to only 1
interface, therefore exposing the web server only to that LAN ?

	Also, try a real message subject next time.

-DDEBUG enables the assertions in the code which check that things are
"as expected" when it is running.  (The assertion should never failure,
they're doublechecks that the program logic is correct.)

There will be a small perfomance overhead, but I wouldn't expect it to
make much of a difference except perhaps if your server is using every
last bit of CPU time, and begging for more.

Yes, -DDEBUG is enabled by default.  You can disable it you setting the
production build model, with: CCPRODLEVEL=production.  (That will also
strip the debugging symbols off the binary.)

I am a bit confused. IP address is not present? Get IP in there? I never use
the webbased interface to change setting of server. It's much easier to just
change the cfg files in a text editor. I just copy the default.cfg file to
new name and change the xitami.cfg file to use this new file as defualt. You
can change setting inside those files. I am affraid I am getting the whole
picture here enough to be of assist. Sorry. Ke

To enable PHP , add this to the end of xitami's defaults.cfg 

[Filter]
php=path/to/php/executable

[Mime] 
.php=application/x-httpd-php3 

Restart the server

Just another idea, is TCP/IP installed on the machine?  With no TCP/IP stack
running, even local loopback won't work. 
Make sure that in the network setup for Win2000 has the TCP/IP protocol
installed.  I can't imagine it wouldn't unless the machine isn't networked
at all.

	Did you try

		ping 127.0.0.1

	as the Xitami install suggests ? You may not have TCP/IP
installed/configured.

Your browser address field, start your browser and type in http://127.0.0.1
or local host. If you don't have local loopback go to your windows directory
and looks for a file called hosts there will also be host.sam forget about
that one. In the host file make sure you have this entry.

127.0.0.1       localhost

You should also check to make sure you have TCP/IP installed in your
networking.

In that case there is probably another HTTP server running -- perhaps
IIS if you are using Windows.  (All sorts of things install bits of IIS
because they think you need it :-( )

>From a shell prompt do:

netstat -na

and look for a "...:80...... LISTEN" line; if you see one (before
starting Xitami) then you've definitely got another webserver running.
In which case look at the task list for likely suspects.

If you don't want to stop the other server, you can run Xitmai on 
another port with:

xitami -b BASE

where base is the number to _offset_ all the Xitami ports by, eg:

xitami -b 5000

makes the HTTP port 5080, so you need to use URLs like:

http://localhost:5080/....

In which case since you didn't know you had the webserver running you 
should probably also get your computer checked out to see if it got 
codered-ed or similar if it has left a test network.

I already have 127.0.0.1 set as localhost, and my TCP/IP is already
installed.  I'm still at a lost as to why it won't work because when i do a
netstat -na I don't see "...80..Listening"

Subject: [Xitami] (no subject)
In-Reply-To: <000f01c17d6f$d960dbd0$0ddcf4d0@dds.davidge.com>

	Mistery then. Nothing running (can't telnet, netstat does not show
anything) and yet you are told the port is not available because something
is running already ? Are you sure ?Weird.

	Any chance you are installing from a non-administrator account and Windows
NT/2000 will not allow access to a privileged port ? (< 1024) I know UNIX
systems have that, so that's why I ask.

	BTW, Port 81 you are seeing in your netstat is is for Xitami's LRWP
protocol. That's why I think the theory above is not valid, otherwise it
would not install on port 81 either.

	Which Xitami are you running ? As a service or the one with the little GUI
on the taskbar (lower right corner) ? If as a service, what happens when you
run this from the console:

		net start xitami


	BTW, if you want to be able to tell which apps are running in these ports,
use http://www.atelierweb.com/pscan/ "AWPS - Atelier Web Port Scanner" (menu
Utilities->Enhanced Ports Finder)

I'm working on setting up another SMTP server that I can configure to
prevent relay.  Know anything about configuring the SMTP service on HPUX

He's on a Win 98 box I think and it's probably got PWS running.

1) use the web interface as I said, don't play with individual files
2) follow the links as I said, you will end up in the SSI config screen. you
will click on "Configuration" on the 1st screen, and then on SSI on the 2nd
screen (text toolbar at the top)

The impression I get from your message is that you did not get to the SSI
screen in your web browser.

Ok Marcio, I have followed your directions.  The configuration screen =
does not have SSI on it anywhere.  The toolbar at the top reads:

Errors  WSX  Filters  Aliases Vhosts CGI Security Logging FTP MIME.

I looked in each one of these and there are no settings for SSI.  I am =
using the Windows version if that makes a difference.  I'm not afraid of =
directly editing files if I know which one(s) to edit, but I would =
prefer the interface if it was available.

  1) use the web interface as I said, don't play with individual files
  2) follow the links as I said, you will end up in the SSI config =
screen. you will click on "Configuration" on the 1st screen, and then on =
SSI on the 2nd screen (text toolbar at the top)

  The impression I get from your message is that you did not get to the =
SSI screen in your web browser.

Interesting... Mine reads like this:

      Aliases Errors SSI MIMEs WSX Filters DDNS Advanced  Server Vhosts CGI
Security Logging FTP



The same screen says I have Xitami v2.5b1 even though I downloaded the b4.

You shouild tweak c:\xitami\defaults.cfg, based on c:\xitami\xitami.cfg.
Don't change c:\xitami\xitami.cfg

This is what I have in mine, for example:


[Cgi]
    Dirlist = "1"
    Form-query = "1"

[Filter]
    .php = "c:\\php\\php.exe"
    .php3 = "c:\\php\\php.exe"
    .pl = "c:\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe"

[Mime]
.php=application/x-httpd-php
.php3=application/x-httpd-php3
.pl=application/x-httpd-perl


[Ftp]
    Enabled = "0"

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

[Server]
    Autostart = "1"
    Priority = "2"
    Recover = "1"

[Win32]
    16bit-cgi = "1"


    And this is what you can override in it about SSI: (note the exec=0 by
default)


#   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
#   SSI configuration section
#
#   This section controls Xitami's built-in server-side includes (SSI)
#   handling.

[Ssi]
#   Lets you enable/disable SSI handling.

    enabled=1

#   Specifies the format for times shown by SSI pages.

    timefmt=%A, %d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S %Z

#   Specifies whether size should be shown as bytes or as
#   abbreviations (Kb, Mg). Anything other than the string "bytes" is
#   taken to mean that sizes are shown as abbreviations.

    sizefmt=bytes

#   The timeout for CGI programs called from the SSI agent.

    timeout=30

#   Error message shown when an SSI command fails. The %s symbol is
#   replaced by the cause of the problem.

    errmsg=<p>[xitami SSI: %s]

#   If 1, allows CGIs to be executed using the #exec command. Since
#   this is a security weakness, this option is switched-off by
#   default.

    exec=0

  Ok Marcio, I have followed your directions.  The configuration screen does
not have SSI on it anywhere.  The toolbar at the top reads:

  I looked in each one of these and there are no settings for SSI.  I am
using the Windows version if that makes a difference.  I'm not afraid of
directly editing files if I know which one(s) to edit, but I would prefer
the interface if it was available.

    1) use the web interface as I said, don't play with individual files
    2) follow the links as I said, you will end up in the SSI config screen.
you will click on "Configuration" on the 1st screen, and then on SSI on the
2nd screen (text toolbar at the top)

    The impression I get from your message is that you did not get to the
SSI screen in your web browser.

      Thanks for the reply.  I don't have any settings for SSI.  Is there an
.ini file setting I should use, or is this setting on someplace other than
the main Configuration screen?

      I'm running version 2.4d9

        http://localhost/admin

        Click Configuration

        Click SSI

        Make sure SSI is enabled.

          I am trying to use an HTML tag such as:
<!--#EXEC=/CGI/WHATever....-->   I have been told that I need to "turn on"
the #exec feature in my web server.  I have poured through the xitami
documentation as well as I can, but I don't see where/how I turn this on so
I can use the #exec command.

          Any help?

          TIA!

Subject: [Xitami] PHP/perl as non-CGI
Message-ID: <B121AEA4C026D51180670000E899F02722F712@MAILSERVER>

 Hi,
  I've searched the archive, and while the question of PHP and PERL 
as non-CGI (fastcgi/WSX etc and not seperate process executed everytime)
has been raised many time, there has 
been no post telling 'yes i've done it and here is the url'.

Does anybody has PHP/perl running as non-CGI in Xitami ?
If yes, are they willing to share the patch .

Hi!
Surely it's a question of the used version.
As far as I know the SSI-functionallity is included since version 2.5.
I use version 2.5b4 and the option is available exactly as Marcio =
describes it.
The best solution would be  to update your Xitami.
Otherwise you have to add to the filter-section of your defaults.cfg =
file:

   [Filter]
       shtml=3Dperlssi               #   Parse files with .shtml =
extension and pass it to perlssi which is a "FakeSSI"

and further the doku says:

#   The exec cmd=3D tag is only recognised if you set the environment =
variable
#   "SSI_INSECURE=3Dyes", in your autoexec.bat or system environment =
(for NT).



Best regards

Torsten

    1) use the web interface as I said, don't play with individual files
    2) follow the links as I said, you will end up in the SSI config =

SSI on the 2nd screen (text toolbar at the top)

Date: Thu, 6 Dec 2001 10:28:10 -0500
Subject: [Xitami] PHP/perl as non-CGI
In-Reply-To: <B121AEA4C026D51180670000E899F02722F712@MAILSERVER>
Message-ID: <000a01c17e6a$9cc93630$0100a8c0@celeron2k>

	As far as I know Xitami has LRWP, not FastCGI. LRWP is not FastCGI, but it
is very similar. "The protocol between Xitami and the LRWP Peer is much
simpler than the FastCGI protocol, and therefore less prone to
implementation differences or errors. However, given the right circumstances
it is possible to run the same program as both a LRWP Peer and a FastCGI
Peer with only minor differences in the startup code. "


	So, you'd have to write your own C adapter to be a LRWP/FastCGI server &
link to the PHP/Perl interpreter.

	What I've seen in PHP (and probably Perl) under Win32 is that they support
the Microsoft way of doing things (ISAPI or something like that), which I
don't think Xitami supports ? Anyway, under PWS (Personal Web Server) and
IIS you can probably enable them in this faster mode (ISAPI).


	Again, maybe by now Xitami supports ISAPI, but I don't think so. I think
they don't because they want to be OS-portable, and ISAPI would be
Windows-specific. I could be wrong.

	Zope (www.zope.org) has a regular, thin CGI which then talks to Zope on a
specific port. So, if you configure Zope behind Apache, you use this
small&fast CGI which gets loaded/unloaded for every request, but it is
fast/small. It then opens a connection to Zope on a given socket, and they
exchange data, and the little CGI passes the bytes back to Apache. This is
another option, but you'd have to write the little CGI yourself and leave
the PHP or Perl interpreter running, listening for requests on a port (like
a Java servlet engine, etc). The advantage of this compared to an apache MOD
is that it is portable across web servers. You can run Zope behind any web
server just by porting this tiny CGI to the new platform. LRWP, on the other
ahnd, is Xitami-specific. MODs are Apache-specific. ISAPI is
Windows-specific. The Zope solution is very portable with a small
performance penalty (lightweight CGI + sockets). There's no ideal solution
:-)

	But Zope is designed to be a server & listen on a port, while the PHP/Perl
interpreters aren't. That's why they need more work, like a C code that
links to teh interpreter & does the glue work. It would be nice if Xitami
supported ISAPI.

	Sorry I don't have good news. Hope this helps a bit. Note that I may be
wrong in some points, it's been a while since I looked into this.

Hi!
Surely it's a question of the used version.
As far as I know the SSI-functionallity is included since version 2.5.
I use version 2.5b4 and the option is available exactly as Marcio =
describes it.
The best solution would be  to update your Xitami.
Otherwise you have to add to the filter-section of your defaults.cfg =
file:
=20
   [Filter]
       shtml=3Dperlssi               #   Parse files with .shtml =
extension and pass it to perlssi which is a "FakeSSI"

and further the doku says:

#   The exec cmd=3D tag is only recognised if you set the environment =
variable
#   "SSI_INSECURE=3Dyes", in your autoexec.bat or system environment =
(for NT).



Best regards
=20
Torsten

  Ok Marcio, I have followed your directions.  The configuration screen =
does not have SSI on it anywhere.  The toolbar at the top reads:

  I looked in each one of these and there are no settings for SSI.  I am =

    1) use the web interface as I said, don't play with individual files
    2) follow the links as I said, you will end up in the SSI config =
screen. you will click on "Configuration" on the 1st screen, and then on =
SSI on the 2nd screen (text toolbar at the top)
    =20
    The impression I get from your message is that you did not get to =
the SSI screen in your web browser.

References: <000a01c17e6a$9cc93630$0100a8c0@celeron2k>
Message-ID: <001701c17e70$6a330510$205dddd8@LACKY>

I've spent the morning trying to get php running as ISAPI without any luck.
It sure looks like it should work the set-up is very similar to another
server I use. I don't seem to be getting any errors Xitami is servering the
test page but it is not processing the script.

The FAQ says:
  1.. First off, make sure Xitami is installed and running.
  2.. Next, download and install the PHP binary distribution into some
directory. We'll assume it's c:\php.
  3.. Add '.php=c:\php\php.exe' to the Filter section of the Xitami
confguration.
  4.. Rename the PHP initialisation file, 'php3.ini-dist' to 'php3.ini' and
copy it into the Windows directory. Don't bother trying to set the PHPRC
environment variable, because this does not seem to work.
  5.. Edit the ini file and change the 'extension_dir' setting to c:\php.
  6.. Now test PHP by hand with a small test page, by running it in a
command window, in the Xitami directory:
c:\php\php webpages\test.php

	If it is just serving the file instead of executing it, add this to your
defaults.cfg:

[Mime]
.php=application/x-httpd-php
.php3=application/x-httpd-php3



	I've had the same problem with regular CGI stuff.

Subject: [Xitami] Regular Expression escaping?
Message-ID: <200112061149968.SM00191@BOB-PADDOCK>

I want a form that will let me enter Regular Expressions, then pass to PHP's egrepi function.

If I enter some thing like "^062\b" when I submit it I end up with "^062\\b" (note the double slash).

Can some one tell me who is doing me this favor of escaping things for me, and how do I prevent it?


    <FORM method='post' action='pbsearchresult.php'>
      <INPUT type="hidden" name='cmd' value='search'> <INPUT type=
      "text" name='data' value='^062.* 8.*MHz'> <INPUT type="submit"
      name='do' value=
      'Search with (POSIX-style) regular expression'><BR>
    </FORM>

    echo "You are searching for <B>$data</B>:<BR>\n";

Good thought but still nothing. I still get a blank page (source) hmmm I'll
keep at this I know I'm missing something basic. I also tried setting the
extention .php to c:\php\php.exe

        BTW, there's a PHP download which automatically configures Xitami.
It has a wizard that does it all. It's the MSI download for PHP, not the zip
version. The problem with that is that it does not come with all the
extensions compiled in. You may not care, though.

        Also, the way you are doing seems to be regular CGI, not ISAPI. For
ISAPI you tell the web server which DLL to load. When you point to the EXE,
it's usually non-ISAPI, but regular CGI.  See
http://www.dynamic-webpages.de/php/install.iis.php

----- cut here ------

If you choose the CGI binary, do the following:
Edit the enclosed pws-php4cgi.reg file (look into the sapi dir) to reflect
the location of your php.exe. Forward slashes should be escaped, for
example:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w3svc\parameters\Scrip
t Map] ".php"="c:\\php\\php.exe"


If you choose the ISAPI module, do the following:
Edit the enclosed pws-php4isapi.reg file (look into the sapi dir) to reflect
the location of your php4isapi.dll. Forward slashes should be escaped, for
example:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w3svc\parameters\Scrip
t Map] ".php"="c:\\php\\sapi\\php4isapi.dll"

----- cut here ------

    Again, I am not sure Xitami supports ISAPI.

&gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; As far as I know Xitami has LRWP, not FastCGI. LRWP is =

with=20
only minor differences in the startup code. "<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; =
&gt;<BR>&gt;=20
&gt; So, you'd have to write your own C adapter to be a LRWP/FastCGI =

&gt;<BR>&gt; &gt;=20
What I've seen in PHP (and probably Perl) under Win32 is that<BR>&gt; =
they=20
support<BR>&gt; &gt; the Microsoft way of doing things (ISAPI or =

Anyway,=20
under PWS (Personal Web<BR>&gt; Server) and<BR>&gt; &gt; IIS you can =

enable them in this faster mode (ISAPI).<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; =
&gt;<BR>&gt; &gt;=20
Again, maybe by now Xitami supports ISAPI, but I don't think so. I =

be<BR>&gt;=20
&gt; Windows-specific. I could be wrong.<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; Zope=20
(www.zope.org) has a regular, thin CGI which then talks to<BR>&gt; Zope =

you use=20
this<BR>&gt; &gt; small&amp;fast CGI which gets loaded/unloaded for =
every=20

to Zope=20
on a given<BR>&gt; socket, and they<BR>&gt; &gt; exchange data, and the =
little=20
CGI passes the bytes back to<BR>&gt; Apache. This is<BR>&gt; &gt; =
another=20
option, but you'd have to write the little CGI yourself<BR>&gt; and=20
leave<BR>&gt; &gt; the PHP or Perl interpreter running, listening for =

advantage=20
of this compared to an apache<BR>&gt; MOD<BR>&gt; &gt; is that it is =

across web servers. You can run Zope<BR>&gt; behind any web<BR>&gt; &gt; =
server=20
just by porting this tiny CGI to the new platform. LRWP, on the<BR>&gt;=20
other<BR>&gt; &gt; ahnd, is Xitami-specific. MODs are Apache-specific. =
ISAPI=20
is<BR>&gt; &gt; Windows-specific. The Zope solution is very portable =

small<BR>&gt; &gt; performance penalty (lightweight CGI + sockets). =
There's=20
no<BR>&gt; ideal solution<BR>&gt; &gt; :-)<BR>&gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; But =

I'm not using IIS but I see your point. I just checked my working server and
this is my mapping for php. I will give this a try with the Xitami

*.phtml *.php3 *.php = C:/php/sapi/php4isapi.dll

From xitami@lists.xitami.org  Thu Dec  6 17:06:31 2001

Subject: [Xitami] PHP/perl as non-CGI
In-Reply-To: <000f01c17e75$e7e40b80$205dddd8@LACKY>
Message-ID: <001801c17e78$5a1d00b0$0100a8c0@celeron2k>

	Did you remember to stop/start the server ? It may not be reading the
config file. It may be configured to re-read every 60 seconds, etc.

	But, as I said, this is not ISAPI, it's CGI. For that (CGI), either you use
the PHP MSI install to have it all done automatically, or by hand like this:

1) Add this to the end of c:\xitami\defaults.cfg

[Filter]
php=c:\php\php.exe

[Mime]
.php=application/x-httpd-php3


2) Restart the server

	(which assumes you already have PHP installed, under c:\php)

	I just saw that ISAPI for Xitami is still a beta - see
http://www.xitami.com/addons.htm

	I was just trying to show you how it goes with a server that supports ISAPI
and CGI. I know you are trying Xitami :-)

	I don't think it will work under Xitami, unless you have installed Xitami
ISAPI Support (beta 1.1) http://www.xitami.com/addons.htm , in which case I
can't help, never tried it myself.

This seems to be the answer, now to figure out how to get addons running. :)

The PHP magic_quotes variables in php.ini do this. Search php.ini for
magic_quotes, and you'll find three items along with a bit of documentation.

	I use the stripslashes function in PHP to get the original value back:

function stripFormSlashes() {
    global $newQuestion;
    ...

    $newQuestion = stripslashes ($newQuestion);
    ...
}


	But that's a PHP issue, not a Xitami issue. Try www.php.net for that.

	No, he used to have it fine in a Win98 box, and he said he's trying Win2k:

	Personally I don't think it is possible to get a "HTTP port 80-Port is
already used by another server (WSAEADDRINUSE) " and not have anything show
up under netstat.


http://www.catalyst.com/support/help/visual/swrench/errors/wsaeaddrinuse.htm
l
WSAEADDRINUSE
Specified address is already in use
This error is usually generated when an application attempts to create a
listening socket and specifies an address that is in use, or if the socket
is already listening for connections. This error can also occur if the
LocalPort property is set to a non-zero value and the port is being used by
another application. Client applications should typically reset the value of
the LocalPort property to zero before attempting to connect to a remote
host.



http://support.exceloncorp.com/whitepapers/troubleshooting_connection_proble
ms.html
WSAEADDRINUSE:
the application attempts to bind a socket to an IP address/port that has
already been used for an existing socket, or a socket that wasn't closed
properly, or one that is still in the process of closing.

Subject: [Xitami] CGI School
Message-ID: <01b301c17e97$cac11ee0$b61e2341@concentric.net>

Hello,

I got Xitami 'cause I got tired of someone else running my server for me,
and telling me what I can and can't do.  I can, and have, spent all day
looking around the internet for pre-made CGI scritpts with idiot
step-by-step instructions on how to install it, and have the script do
almost what I want it to do.

But, I would really rather make my own scripts that do exactly what I want
them to do.  I don't even really know what I want them to do yet.  I am
inspired by discovered possibilty.

I am a programmer by trade, but I am still very new to any sort of internet
programming.  I mainly know old-school (GW BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL) and  a
half-dozen very proprietary languages.  Currently my Xitami FTP/HTTP server
is running on Windows ME.

I was wondering if anyone could help me with:

A) What would be a good first scripting method to begin with on Xitami?
(PHP,  Perl, etc.)

B) Where are the good beginner tutorial sites, PDFs available for this type
of scripting?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Jay Aldrich

	If you want to do web apps/CGI, I suggest PHP. It reads well, it's easy to
learn, OS- and webserver-portable, and has plenty of resources online.

	If you already know programming and like a "How do I... ?" kind of book, I
recommend "PHP Developer's Cookbook" to get started quickly.

	As far as online stuff there's www.php.net, and you can download a
Microsoft Help file from it, all hyperlinked, with the PHP documentation.

	You can probably search for goodies instead of writing them.
www.freshmeat.net, for example.

	For instance, for sharing digital pictures, you may want to use Gallery
(http://gallery.sourceforge.net/). For portal stuff, PHP Nuke
(http://www.phpnuke.org), and so on.

	You may need to install MySQL for some apps. Some apps may not support
windows, just UNIX.

Hi

when i started using xitami almost all the scripts (perl) available were for
linux.

i had to do what you are talking about doing and i can tell you from
experience it was a long road to walk.

you may fare better with your background so good luck.

perl has been around longer and is easy to find help with and information
on.

there are now many scripts available freely as well

Well, I was just checking out the tutorial, and It seems that PHP is not
enabled cause it trys to download the .php file instead of running it.  I
looked through xitami.cfg, and the admin stuff, but can't find where to turn
it on.  Or, do I just put it in the cgi-bin?

Thanks,

Jay

I am a developer of some 20 years experience C, C++, SQL etc. & have both 'PHP
Developers Cookbook' and 'A Programmers Introduction tp PHP 4.0 by W.J. Gilmore
- printed by Apress. At first I thought that the second book was a little light
on, then bought 'PHP Developers Cookbook' only to learn then A Programmers
Introduction tp PHP 4.0 was far more useful. They both have their place, but A
Programmers Introduction tp PHP 4.0 is a far better start and doesn't rely so
much on referring you the php's CURL library as 'PHP Developers Cookbook'.

You should also look at www.hotscripts.com and
http://www.phpclasses.upperdesign.com for loads of pre-written scripts and
classes.

Subject: [Xitami] PHP/perl as non-CGI
Message-ID: <4A256B1B.0002DEF2.00@shb1ln11.transport.qld.gov.au>


This happens when Xitami runs php.exe but php.exe can't locate the php4ts.dll,
either add the path to php.exe/php4ts.dll to your system environment or move
php4ts.dll to your system directory (e.g. c:\winnt\system32. This happens so
often that I think it should be somewhere in the Xitami documentation.

I haven't had time to investigate, however I suspect it may be because xitami
doesn't make the directory that php.exe is in the current working directory
before launching php.exe, apache doesn't have this problem so it isn't simply
just a 'php issue' just the combination of the way xitami and php work.

Paul




Good thought but still nothing. I still get a blank page (source) hmmm I'll
keep at this I know I'm missing something basic. I also tried setting the
extention .php to c:\php\php.exe

In the php.ini file the extension directory should be set to

c:\php\extensions

If you use the standard php install ('cos that's where the extensions are
installed, they won't be found anywhere else :-) )

I've spent the morning trying to get php running as ISAPI without any luck.
It sure looks like it should work the set-up is very similar to another
server I use. I don't seem to be getting any errors Xitami is servering the
test page but it is not processing the script.

The FAQ says:
  1.. First off, make sure Xitami is installed and running.
  2.. Next, download and install the PHP binary distribution into some
directory. We'll assume it's c:\php.
  3.. Add '.php=c:\php\php.exe' to the Filter section of the Xitami
confguration.
  4.. Rename the PHP initialisation file, 'php3.ini-dist' to 'php3.ini' and
copy it into the Windows directory. Don't bother trying to set the PHPRC
environment variable, because this does not seem to work.
  5.. Edit the ini file and change the 'extension_dir' setting to c:\php.
  6.. Now test PHP by hand with a small test page, by running it in a
command window, in the Xitami directory:
c:\php\php webpages\test.php

Jay,
   I've used them all, PHP, PERL, Java, etc. but when I really need a good
solid Web application, one that does exactly what I want with speed and
stability, there is no substitute for the PowerBasic Console Compiler.
(www.powerbasic.com) Hands down, end of discussion best option going.  From
the sounds of things, you'd feel right at home with PB and it behaves
perfectly with Xitami.

Our CGI is written in Delphi using the CGI Expert component from L.A. Software
and as such can do just about anything (two tier database access/update,
dynamic html, security).  This maybe overkill but it does let us do a lot of
stuff.

>(PHP,  Perl, etc.)

hello

if you're new to scripting, but you can program in basic, you should stay 
to basic !!!! (lots of exclamation points here)
look at ALL the 'help-me' messages about perl & PHP :-) if that is not a 
clue about selecting a language...
i tried perl years ago and it was not a success...
keep your scripting talents if you have some to <script 
language=javascript> in html.
a script is converted at execute time and then executed, an executable is 
already compiled and ready for execution.

you can use visual basic (if you are used to it), but it's like an overkill 
(whenever a visual basic exe is loaded to be executed, other things not 
needed are also loaded).

Xitami will even accept old quickbasic code! (xitami will try to execute 
everyting is executable, even batch files).

i only use powerbasic for 3 (three) days, and i love it!
It has all the needed things to perform string operations (lots of command 
that lack in visual basic and other basic languages like seach-and-replace, 
crop, regular expressions, and so on). And because it's a console program 
(like for instance tracert and ping) it has the power of a 32 application, 
but not the overhead of loading graphics and forms.

Power basic is also network-aware. For instance, you can send mail in let's 
say 5 lines of code (it's not as simple and easy as the 'sendmail' program 
in *nix but it does it job well).

You only need some code to get all the form data into the right variables 
and you print it to the client using PRINT#
I can send you sample code that i use on my site.

Sone nice feature of powerbasic is it's error handling. basically when an 
error occurs, it will continue with the next statement (that's the best 
thing to do, it seems to me) so you don't get an HTTP 500 (internet server 
error)
if needed, you can trap errors visual basic-like.

There are probably other basic flavors floating around that can do the same 
job.

i could't have said it better (maybe in dutch or french)
pb programmers get their job done and don't have problems getting the right 
environment, finding the interpreter and asking the same questions over and 
over again in this list.

with pb you can use your basic programming skills, in less than 3 days you 
will be used to the differences between pb and other basic languages.

i can access a 13000 records-database, calculate things and generate output 
in 100 ms. And there is a mailserver, a virus scanner and a mail client 
running on the same computer (compared to 700 ms in visual basic)

VisualBasic has nothing to do with _real_ web applications. It is just
an ongoing Microsoft policy called "We own the world".

And PHP is great (for me :) because of all its open architecture, multiple
extensions, great databases integration and a clean and smart
documentation.

Anyway, talking about PHP vs Perl vs basic vs ... is just another
"browser war", calm down, choose the tool you're best with and don't
force other people to use it.

It depends on what you want to do, if you just want to format some xml into
webpages, try the GSL processor built into 25b9. It's a very simple language
and seems pretty fast. How you get that xml in the first place however... I
'm a big PHP fan myself.

Subject: [Xitami] Emulating Apache directories
Message-ID: <3C10A69D.20200@freesbee.fr>

One useful thing that you can do in Apache is display a README file at 
the bottom of a directory listing. I tried to do the same thing using 
GSL in xitami and it works most of the time (code below). Where it 
doesn't work is where the directory is an alias to somewhere.

But there is one problemette. Xitami doesn't seem to give me the real 
directory path only the url path so I'm having to hack that to try and 
create the fully qualified filename I want to include in the listing. I 
had a look in the source and it looks like the function in smthttpl.c 
called http_list_directory is the what creates the xml tree for the 
script and it unfortunately doesn't seem to put such a variable in the tree.

There seems to be a different "recent" version on every page for Xitami.
What is the latest version (beta or otherwise), and where could i download
it?

Add:

[alias]
   aliasname=directorypath

to the approriate virtual host configuration file (or defaults.cfg if
you are not using virtual hosts), and restart Xitami.  (You can also do
this through the web based admin.)

>and I wanted to know if I can deny get access from it, but allow 
>list access? this is with the http server

No.

You can do the reverse (allow GETs but refuse to provide a listing), but
not allow a listing and refuse to allow GETs.

If you just want people to be able to see what is there and not download
it I suggest you:
(a) don't use an alias
(b) create a HTML page (or a CGI to output one) that contains (outputs) 
    a list of files that are in that directory with whatever details
    you want.

The point of providing access to a directory is to allow people to
retrieve (GET) things from it; so it sounds to me like you don't want to
allow people access to the directory after all.

Too bad it costs 150.00 vs PHP's $0.

So are the any tutorials on how to write a PB executable/DLL that is can
handle a form post and can act like a PHP or perl script that has logic and
barfs out a resulting page?  I've seen sites that are run off a DLL or EXE
with query sting parms so I'm assuming that is what you'd do with PB?

Scott,
    As has been mentioned here, and I agree completely, each person will
have their favorite tools.....that said, I'd reply to your comment by saying
"you always get what you pay for"  :)

   PB comes with tools that parse form data very easily.  You basically use
a string buffer to put the contents in, then strip off the variable values.
To create the resulting page, you use a line similar to:

WriteCGI "<b>The result of your query " & Request$ & " is: " & ResultValue$
& </b>"

The real power happens between the post/get data and the WriteCGI sections.
Execution speed, even opening a sequential file, reading through it for a
specific value, closing and processing it is amazing, even on low end
hardware.  I'd be more than happy to email you some samples I've wipped
together.  There is also a ton of very impressive source code on the PB user
forums on PowerBasic's web site.

It all comes down to what you're comfortable with.  I think Bob Zale has
created an awesome product (ever since Borland TurboBasic), the support is
exceptional, and even though its not free, I find I can do things with PB
faster and easier than any other tool *most of the time* and to me, that's
worth paying for.   Your mileage may vary.  :)

Hello !

It's not cheap, for a rather simple program, but if it's the right one, the 
money is well spend.
You don't need the DLL-version, only the console one, since you can 
#INCLUDE all the needed recurrent functions in your source (this will also 
speed execution, since there is no loading and linking of DLL's at run time).
If you have any programming experience in basic, writing complete programs 
in PB is easily done. It's a well structured language. It's that simple you 
don't need any tutorial. There is a windows help file included in the 
package for the case you're a newbee in basic.

Xitami will send your program the query string and even parse the form 
fields (if you use a <form method=POST ...> in your html source) by setting 
the environ. It's that simple i could't believe it at first!
And writing output to the browser is even more simple: you simply PRINT it 
to the provided temp-file!
I can mail you a small source code that sends the complete environment 
back, ideal for checking what Xitami actually sends to your program, 
depending on how you call the program.

There are all sorts of available basic routines for parsing data, but don't 
be fooled, you won't need them.

Marc

Already done by Xitami.
Try it (source included, executable on my server).

Better still: simply open the output file and print to it.

     PRINT #3, "</body></html>"                  ' and end the program.

when an error occurs is to try to continue. The only error that can occur 
is a disk full.

Use a$ = REMAIN$(ENVIRON$(i), "=") to get only the value, not the complete 
equate.

ENVIRON$ can be used with named strings (when you know what you are looking 
for, that is when using form data or opening files provided by Xitami) or 
with an index (when you don't know what you are looking for).

This source can be optimised (using integer variables instead of floating 
point defaults and so on).

You can try this program out at <http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi-bin/env.exe>
Add query strings like you want 
<http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi-bin/env.exe?123ABC>

Or use a complete <form... > to call it. There is a sample one included 
with this mail.

	Just a note that one of the reasons I said PHP is a good choice is the fact
that I have to develop for Win32 and Linux. I can't use Windows-specific
tools. This may not be an issue for you (original poster). In fact, very
tight windows integration and OS portability may be conflicting goals most
of the time.


	Also, some people "fall in love" with their tools & languages, and don't
give objective advice, just passionate ones. Take it with a grain of salt.
Most people resist learning a new system or language, so they will defend
their choice as much as possible.


	Whatever you choose, please don't become fanatic about it ;-)

There's an experimental interface to ISAPI (which hooks in using LRWP),
but it's not been extensively tested.  (You can download it from the
xitami.com addons page.)  We'd be interested in hearing if anyone has
managed to get Perl/PHP/etc working via the ISAPI interface.  We also
were experimenting with a PHP/LRWP interface at one stage, but I'm not
sure if that got completed.

Are your .pl files in the cgi-bin directory?  Do they have a #! line at
the start that mentions "perl" in them?  Is perl on your PATH?

The latest versions are 2.4d9 (stable), and 2.5b5 (beta).  As far as I
know all the pages on http://www.xitami.com/  refer to these two
versions.  (http://www.imatix.com/ is still waiting for its update so
is a bit behind.)

You can download Xitami using the download links at:

Well spotted.  This is a bug (as far as I'm concerned), and I've added
it to our bug list.

You are right that smthttpl.c:http_list_directory() is what is creating
the directory (as an XML tree).  One of the things that it should also
add to the XML is the path to the actual directory on disk, since it
obviously needs to know this while it is preparing the list of files,
and it would be useful to the GSL script outputting the directory.  The
directory path is, I think, in p_http-> file_name, so adding an
attribute with that value into the top level of the XML would be useful,
called perhaps "path_on_disk".

Xitami tries to use port 81 for LRWP; but it's never actually had that
port reserved.  Perhaps somthing else is using port 81?  If so you might
want to try running Xitami with LRWP disabled, by adding:

[lrwp]
  enabled=0

to your defaults.cfg.

There's not, currently, a way to limit the number of requests by IP
address.

One thing you might want to consider (in the 2.5 beta) is using the
bandwidth shaping feature, to limit the amount of traffic that is sent
out to particular locations -- so that they don't get any benefit from
making more than one request in parallel.  See pipedef.xml, and the
related documentation.

Yes.  Either on different IP addresses (tell each one to use only a
specific IP address), or on different ports.  

>If I can, how can I direct my browser to correct site/virtual site?

If you use different IP addresses, use your hosts file, or the DNS, to
map from the names to the IP addresses for each server.  If you use
different ports, include the port number in the URL.

You can run Xitami on a different port using the "portbase" command line
option: -b BASE (which shifts _all_ port numbers up by that BASE
amount).

You can run Xitami on only one specific IP address by adding:

[server]  
  ipaddress=aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd

in your defaults.cfg and restarting Xitami.

Yes, virtual hosts are fine with PHP -- in fact this is the recommended

Yup, that's the easiest solution.  You can tell the Xitami service which
user to run as, and if you set up a uesr _just_ for Xitami (like IIS
does for itself) then you can restrict what it can do quite easily.

It's hard to be specific about what to do without knowing which
operating system you are using.  The basic rules are: turn off
everything you don't need, try to run as a user that has the smallest
number of privileges necessary to do everything you need to, and make
sure that all the files are readable only by the user that needs access
to them.

There are other things to do if you're using scripting langauges (perl,
PHP, etc), but at that point it starts getting moderately specific to
your installation.

This is Xitami's (somewhat cryptic) debugging information.  It means
that while running smtsock (the module in Xitami that sends and receives
things over the network), in the "state" Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self, it
ran into problems with one of the events it mentions.  

Basically this shouldn't happen :-)

Unfortunately this sort of thing seems to happen occassionally, "at
random" which suggests that Xitami is occassionally being confused by
something, and crashing.

If we can track down any pattern of thing that reliably happens before a
problem like this, so that we can reproduce the problem, then it'll be
easier to fix.  Until then the best we can do is try to fix likely
causes of the problem.

BTW, this data-port should probably be adjusted to be "20", ie, -54980.
(There was a typo in some versions of the configuration file that
wrongly listed the data port as 200.)

You should watch the Xitami start up messages and make sure that it is
starting things on the ports that you expect them to be started on.

Beyond that, FTP with the server behind a firewall (eg, your roadrunner
config) can be pretty tricky to get going, especially passive FTP when
the server is behind a firewall.  (Active FTP tends to work better when
the server is behind a firewall, and passive FTP tends to work better
when the client is behind a firewall -- if _both_ are behind firewalls,
you can end up with no FTP working at all, even if both firewalls are
trying to let FTP through :-( )

What happens when you try to run them?  Xitami/Pro is basically the free
Xitami with SSL support added in at present, so basically everything
that works with Xitami should work with Xitami/Pro, providing your
configuration is the same (plus the SSL-only extras).

That is weird.  The source on the Xitami download pages is the source
that was used to build the Xitami binaries on the download pages (taken
straight from our CVS archive).  The binaries were build with MSVC 6.0,
with the "install this service pack before distributing binaries"
service pack installed.  IIRC the binaries were built on a Windows 98
machine.

Basically this is "close enough" to what you had that I'd expect you to
get the same results.  About the only thing you might want to do is see 
if there is a newer service pack for MSVC than the one you have; I have
a feeling that there is one after the sp1 you mentoin.  

Have you managed to figure out anything about the problem in the few
weeks since you posted?

It's not.  It's a good idea, but it's not implemented that way at
present.  The way the webmasks work at present is that it converts the
IP address being considered into a dotted-quad (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd) and
then compares it section by section.  This is to handle the wildcards.

SunOS 4?  (As opposed to Solaris 2.x, 7, 8, or 9)

I'd suggest just trying the "default" gcc options (-O2 -DDEBUG), and see
how you get on.  The main time you're likely to have problems is
linking, where you may need to link in libsocket, libnsl, and other
things a bit like that.  (It's been ages since I've used SunOS 4, so I
don't remember exactly what was required.)

The iMatix "c" build script knows how to compile/link on SunOS 4 (and
various versions of Solaris), but unfortunately it assumes that you are
using the Sun compiler.

You need to disable the WSX entry as well.  Unfortunately (due to a bug)
I think the only way you can do this is to edit xitami.cfg, and comment
out the line:

    admin=xiadmin

(the bug that means that you can't override these settings is in our bug
list already).

Yup.  Beware that there are _two_ webmask settings in the configuration
file (used for different things); make sure you're setting the right
one.  (Based on the section that the setting is in.)

>Now, what goes in that text file???  How do I type in the addresses??
>Should I put in the [webmask] at the top??

No [webmask] at the top.  Just list the IP addresses (with wildcards),
one per line.   Put a ! at the start to negate it.  Make sure you have
something to allow all the addresses you want allowed; the default is to
deny everything once you have a webmask list.  (If there's no webmask
list it allows everything.)

Have you changed the webroot in defaults.cfg?  If so, there's a bug in
some versions of Xitami (including, I think, the released versions) that
means that this overrides _every_ webroot.  (It's fixed in the
development version in CVS.)

The Xitami server debugging is useful in tracking this down; to turn it
on set:

[server]   
  debug=1

then try again, then look at the debug logs to see what Xitami is basing
its returned things on.

>Does anyone from xitami read this?

Yes, but we don't always get a chance to reply as often as we might.
(And when we do, it tends to be to a whole bunch of messages at once,

The default IE5 page is useless for trying to debug problems like this.  
You need to go into the advance options and disable the "friendly" HTTP
error messages, so that IE will show you the real error message, and you
actually stand a chance of figuring out what is going wrong.  The real
error message, plus cgierr.log, will often lead you to the problem.

In theory this should work, _providing_ the HTTP headers come at the
very beginning.  The output of GSL is handled basically the same way as
a CGI's output in Xitami, and that means that some reparsing of headers
is done, so you should be able to output them _at_the_beginning_ and
have it work. 

Of course this means that you've got to figure out early on in your GSL
script (before outputting anything) if you want to give up and return an
error/redirect.

The solution you found (of using a meta-refresh) will work, but it's not
quite as tidy as a proper redirect for some things.

Unfortunately you can't do this easily; the best you can do is have one
virtual host where anyone can get in with a password (or just those you
list can get in with a password), and another virtual host where only
certain IP addresses can access it, without a password.

Not, really, no.  The logging module keeps the log files open when it is
running, but it is supposed to close them prior to trying to rename them.

So basically there's a few things that could be going on:
1.  The files are open for some reason, and so the log rotation fails
    (this would be a bug)

2.  The destination files exist for some reason (in which case Xitami
    is supposed to try some alternative names)

3.  The new files cannot be written for some reason (unlikely)

4.  The path names used internally for renaming the files are wrong
    (I've seen this happen in some older versions of Xitami.)

Running Xitami in server debug mode overnight:

[server]
  debug=1

in defaults.cfg may give you a little bit more information about what is
happening.

You can just create the cgi-bin directory.  It got left out,
accidentally, because it was an empty directory, and the installer
program we use isn't that keen on including empty directories.

The source to the servlet runner is in the same archive that you
downloaded the servlet runner itself from.  Unfortunately Java, and the
JSDK have moved on at a cracking pace since it was written, so it needs
some updating to work with more recent versions of the JSDK.  (It was
written for Java 1.x and the JSDK 2.0; I think it'll mostly work with
Java 2 and the JSDK 2.0; but it definitely needs updates for the later
JSDKs.)

What encoding are you using for the upload?  The standard encoding used

What this means is "it took too long".  Typically when you're testing 
that's not because the server is overloaded but because something your
CGI is trying to do is taking far too long.  Common things are looking
up names in the DNS, accessing a database, etc.  Basically in these
situations you have to try to figure out which bit it is that is taking
so long.

That's because you probably don't have a file called "\dtf-tests\*\*Job.type".

Xitami can't expand wildcards in the same fancy way that unix FTP
servers do (generally by calling an external ls program to do it).

The FTP server in Xitami is intended to be a simple one to complement
the HTTP server.  If you need more advanced functions, then disable the
built in FTP server and use another one.

works for me in defaults.cfg. That's 2.4d7 though. Asking for /admin

What this says is 'there is a /admin, and it is handled by the "" module', 
which is why you get the 501.  To completely hide the URL, so there is 
no /admin, you need to comment out the line in xitami.cfg instead, and
then you should get the 404.

If you can live with the 501, then your entry in defaults.cfg is tidier,
and less likely to break next time you upgrade xitami.

There is a ting in the logfile where I'm not sure if it is implemented.
I'm trying to get monthly reports in the XLML-format, what I get are the
standard daily reports in the CLFX-format.

I wonder if the commands "Cycle" and "Format" are implemented, they are
documented in the "Administration"-pages, but not in the "Configuration"
pages of the manual.



[Accesslog]
    Filename=test.log
    Cycle=monthly

    Format=XLML

I suggest "phyical_path". Also note that due to some cunning code 
reusing p_http->file_name as a place to store the temporary outfile name 
you will have to do this before you create the tempfile at line 2198!

I will build a unix(linux actually) version to verify that it works over 
the next couple of days - but I don't yet a Win32 compiler so I can't do 
win32.

That reminds me. Can you add to the wish list that you have an 
alternative command line of
[server]
  ipaddress=(eth0)

or similar for those of us in the odd situation of wanting to put Xitami 
on a DHCP interface (where the IP address may vary considerably) but 
where you have 2 or 3 possible IP interfaces in the machine? I agree its 
a particulalry rare request but I just found a place where I wanted to 
do this. The easy workaround was to run an external script to determine 
the IP address of the relevant ethernet card and add it to defaults.cfg 
but it would be nice it I didn't have to go to the extra effort.

All,

I have noted (and raised at Bugzilla) a very weird bug which I don't 
think is Xitami related - but it could be. I have no great interest in 
installing IIS on some machine to prove that its not a Xitami problem

Basically the problem is that mozilla fails to display local xitami 
served webpages on win2k properly.

I have not noted this behavior with "NS6.0", the AOL-branded Mozilla. 

I should have, because I posted a many-image page on an Xitami server
and my boss loaded "NS6" (she thought it was NetScape). I checked mine
and other pages many times to be sure that my boss's "NS6 experience"
was as good as could be given "NS6"s unique rendering.

That was mostly on NT4 but I have also looked with W2000.

"NS6" won't handle the Xitami /Admin pages.... known bug, conflict with
some reserved word. 

"NS6" trashes &...;-sequences when editing HTML in a textarea for
updating pages. 

Otherwise, in the "NS6.1" release, AOL's new toy is maybe not the worst
browser out there. But I still keep it on a tight leash.

I do not know what the changes are from Mozilla/Gecko to AOL-"NS6".

I succesfully run PHPWebsite (http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/) on my OS/2 machine 
running Xitami and PHP standalone (aka CGI) and MySQL for OS/2.

This is a PHP Nuke 'light' clone, but with some interesting features.

Most of Netscape 4.x rendering bugs still exist in the 6.x series yet they
are fixed in Mozilla.  Although the latest Mozilla seems to have some
rendering quirks of it's own that are new to the build.  Overall Mozilla and
Opera make NS look like the dung heap.  (No I don't like NS POS IMHO).

I'm not using phpmyadmin.

I've done all the proper setup for phpnuke and now have errors up the ying
yang.  There are others that I have played with that a lot work better.

I am close to going out to get another box and put *nix on it for all my
test sites before publishing them for the clients.

I haven't used NS6 for some months now as I prefer Mozilla (no AOL ads 
etc...) but I would expect this to occur in NS6.1 and 6.2 (NS6.0 was a 
buggy piece of $#!+)

Was she/you browsing from the machine that xitami is running on? and is 
it win2k? both machines I have tested it on are running win2k pro. I 
think this is a really specfic bug to win2k and browsing the pages on 
the same machine. I only discovered it when I decided to take some work 
home for the weekend so I copied a bunch of pages from the server to my 
laptop (running win2k pro ) and installed xitami on it to run as test 
server.

Today I went back and tested to try and narrow down the bug repeatability

Its OK on win ME and win 95 but both my win2k machines do have a problem.
Remote machines browsing display perfectly on all machines
IE 5.x (5.0 5.5 various patches) all work fine

I don't use the editor in mozilla/NS6 at present. Complete pants would

Hi, i've sucessfully installed an run phpnuke( more exactly postnuke v.064) 
with xitami on win2k.

What you most probably get is WARNINGS _NOT ERRORS. This is php-related and 
occurs only due to sloppy php syntax (usage of single quotes instead of 
double quotes).
Try setting your php.ini settings to something like show_errors = ERRORS 
instead of ALL and most of them will vanish.

There is one problem with redirects in case you don't install your project 
into the (webserver) root directory, which you most likely want to do. To 
fix this I've submitted a fix to the postnuke project site somwhere at 
sourceforge.

Of course there are some minor bugs, it's still in development, but I 
consider it to be a way cool tool and suggest to give it a more thorough try.

I used enctype="multipart/form-data". The funny thing is that exactly 
the same script works perfectly fine on my web-host's Apache server with 
the same PHP version.

OK so I inserted 2 lines at line 2113.

Old code
    /*  Create root XML 
item                                                 */
    root_item = xml_new (NULL, "directory", "");
   
    /*  Now transform directory listing into an XML 
tree                     */
    total_files = 0;
    total_size  = 0;

New code
    /*  Create root XML 
item                                                 */
    root_item = xml_new (NULL, "directory", "");
    /*  Output path to directory for GSL scripts */
    xml_put_attr (root_item, "physical_path", p_http-> file_name);
   
    /*  Now transform directory listing into an XML 
tree                     */
    total_files = 0;
    total_size  = 0;

This works fine and allows GSL directory scripts to search for README or 
similar.

It doesn't matter but it is important to note that you will not get the 
absoluet path of non-aliased directories, just the directory relative to 
the xitami base directory. I.e. you get webpage/images/ for the images 
directory in a default config. Since GSL doesn't seem to have a command 
to list the current working directory (e.g. /usr/local/xitami or 
/opt/xitami) you cannot infer from this variable where the xitami server 
is located on the file system. This seems to me to be excellent security 
as I can't see why you would need it but it should be noted for future 
reference.

However in testing this it seems that you cannot have an alias like 
relative = ../relative/ whereas rel = ./rel does work and the directory 
given for GSL is rel/

This could possibly be another bug?

Subject: [Xitami] Weird Linux Behviour
Message-ID: <3C176A48.4010402@freesbee.fr>

If I'm missing something blindingly obvious in linux then feel free to 
tell me I'm an idiot, I freely admit to being less knowledgable about it.

I just started playing with the web-based admin and then manually 
editing the defaults.cfg file of my Xitami server on Linux. The file is 
pretty trivial (to put it mildly) but in the process of editing it or 
something I seem to have removed the ability to see the webroot! The 
server now gives me a 404 error when I go any page off the ./webpages/ 
directory but just to confuse me pages got to by alias do work! I can 
even have an alias of root which is / and from there navigate to the 
 xitami/webpages directory and when I do I get the default,htm file 
displayed.

In other words http://host/ gives 404 and 
http://host/root/<path>/webpages/ where <path> is the correct path gives 
me the page I expect to be displayed by http://host/ !

A couple of times in mucking around with it - but still not adding a 
webpages line I get to see '/' as my default page. No idea how or why! 
If I stop and restart the server all is fine until I make a few changes 
then it all goes mad again. This is the same with both the real 2.5b5 
version and the one ai made the 1 line change to

Help please.

If I use the xiwin32.exe, everything seems to work fine.

Message-ID: <EIEFKMGPDJCOPNFNDKIAAEFKDCAA.phpshop@phpshop.org>

Is it possible to rewrite URL in the way that you do in Apache using
mod_rewrite?

I am trying to redirect using the following Apache rewrite rule:

RewriteRule !\.(gif|jpg|png)$ /public_html/index.php

This would redirect all requests to the index.php file, except image files.

Any ideas how to do this in Xitami?

I recently set up a "discussion board" using Discus. There
is a free version and a Pro version(US$ 150.00). Check it
out at http://discusware.com. Works well with Xitami.

There's no direct equivilent of mod_rewrite, no.  The best I can suggest
is something like a LRWP that handles the rewriting, but that'd take a
little bit of work to set up.

There is a problem with the links in the online documentation.  
The << and >> links at the top of the page point back to the index.

So it does. The solution appears to be to download the zipfile with the 
executable and extract it.

That has documentation similar to that listed above only with hyperlinks 
that work. I would guess the source code zip file also contains 
documentation but I haven't downloaded it to check.

Hi!

I'm running 2.5b5 on w2ksp2

I want to use a feature of Xitami which allows to provide different content
(actually serve different files) depending on accept-language request header
sent by user-agent (browser).
So I put, for example, index.html_en and index.html_ru (or index.html.en and
index.html.ru) into root. When  browser receives any of these files it
suggests to save it or open. On the other hand .htm, .html and .shtml files
are served fine.
Does this mean that I have to add mime types for all the possible extensions
(index.htm_en, index.html_en, index.shtml_en, index.htm_ru, index.html_ru,
index.shtml_ru and what not), or I better be using '.lang' extension instead
of  '.*htm*_lang' and then add mime for '.lang' extension only - will it
work this way?
And now a stupid question. If this is supposed to be a feature, why then the
server can't detect '_lang' at the end of the file and then send in response
header a mime type of the corresponding file, which extension appears after
dot and prior to '_lang'? Or am I doing smth wrong or missing smth? Help,
please.

Mike.

Please bear with me, I've read through the docs but the light bulb is just
not quite lighting up for me.

I create CGI applications in compiled (.exe) form on the Win32 platform.
What I'm trying to do, and I think it can be done, is use SSI to dynamically
add components to my web page.  Specifically, I want to create a drop down
list in a form from items in a database.  I can code the CGI portion (i.e.
grab the data out of the database and format the proper form code for the
drop-down menu) but I can't quite make the final link to get the .SSI page
to include this part.

In my .SSI page, I have a line:  <!--#exec
cgi="http://www.byrneworld.com/cgi-bin/ezcount.exe"-->

The ezcount.exe program exists in this location, but the resulting page
shows [xitami SSI:]  (the error code format as defined in the SSI page on
xitami's configuration page) but I don't know what the error is, how to find
any further information on it, or why its happening.

I would *greatly* appreciate it if someone could tell me in rather basic
terms how to use SSI (assuming I can do this).

TIA,

Hi-
    I've been following this list for a month or so, now, and I'll
confess that much of the discussion is over my head.
    I'm considering setting up a server for my personal website
(currently on a commercial virtual server) that actually gets quite a
bit of traffic.  The pages will be basic html with some minimal
graphics, no cgis or anything fancy.  The server will run on a dedicated
computer connected to the internet by dsl (128 up).  I have a pentium II
333mhz with 320mb ram for the purpose.  My question is: what level of
traffic should this system be able to handle and what is the weakest
link - bandwidth, processor speed or memory?  I don't want to commit to
this approach if the system will not be robust enough to handle several
concurrent users.
   Thanks in advance for your insights.

By far your weakest link is the dsl(128 up).  We ran over a year with a dual
channel ISDN for the same 128 up on a Pentium Pro 200mhz and 256mb ram.
Xitami is very processor and memory friendly.

Your low bandwidth is the stumbling block, but as long as you keep the
graphics down to under 50k per page and don't use any audio, video, flash et
cetera, you can serve quite a number of concurrent users.

With that rig, you may be limited by your 128K wire. But if you
are just serving basic pages, I think both your wire and your CPU
are over-kill. 

I had Xitami running on a 386SX-16 w/4 Megs. Single surfers
outside the building could NOT tell that it was a very lame
server; some commented that it seemed fast. Inside the building I
could feel a slight hesitation compared to my Pentium server  but
not much. 

Your P-333 is 40 times the power of that 386SX-16. 

When my main server was P-133 with 32 Megs RAM, one web-page
suddenly "took off". Up to 300 hits per day on a page with 27
images and a counter, on top of 200+ hits per day on the main
pages. (The "hot page" had an image of a woman in a shirt open to
her navel, but "nothing showing".... go figure.)

While I did not do a detailed analysis of the logs, I'm sure
there were simultaneous surfers. It held up just fine. When I
happened to be watching the CPU Utilization meter, it generally
sat at 2% with 1-second bursts that were higher, no sustained CPU
load. 

Likewise, even with 32M, the hard drive sat quietly, most data
cached in RAM. So quiet that when someone was sitting next to it
and I remotely started sucking the whole website down for
back-up, that person commented on the unusual racket. 

I've since moved it to a P-350 and 128M, and added Streaming
Media server to it, and that is fine and snappy even with many
hits a day. 

OK, here's my main server's stats at this moment: 

 HTTP service started at 20/Sep/2001 (*)
 Highest open connections:  25
 Total number of hits:  170260
 Total data transferred  2215Mb

(*) Last re-boot after move to new hardware... For a Windows App,
Xitami is mighty robust!

In your situation, I'd worry about the DSL. Is it really 24/7, or
more like 23.9/6.9 ? In my situation, hard-wired on the campus of
a large university, most of my server "outages" have not been my
server but the campus network. Router malfunction, 4 hours; DoS
storm, 2 days; and the power was out for a week while they
upgraded power transformers. You may be better served by a
commercial host, which should have better control of their link
to the Internet and their power needs. But, do-it-yourself can
work fine too.

If it's a "cgi" then it should be "/cgi-bin/CGINAME"; ie, it should be a
relative URL not a full URL.  This is particularly necessary with Xitami
2.4 and the PerlSSI, which takes a fairly naive approach to resolving
the path (stick the CGI directory name in front of CGINAME and hope for
the best).

If you're having trouble make sure you've got execution of CGIs turned
on, and check cgierr.log for any errors running the CGI.

hello world


FYI: instead of using server side includes, you can also add a
<script src=http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/ezcount.exe></script>
The only difference in the exe file (compared to a exe-file that creates a 
complete page) is that the browser expects javascript, not html. Simply 
put: if you want to display "hello world" you will have to output 
"document.write('hello world');" [doubles quotes added for clarity].
I use a subroutine to add the javascript container to the desired output.

Thanks Ewen
    Tried that, it still fails.  There are no entries in the cgierr.log file
so I'm still in the dark.  Can you confirm two things for me?

(1) With all things in order, "should" this work? (i.e. I should be able to
construct a Win32 executable to include html form controls into an existing
web page?)

(2) Your comment to "hope for the best" means that this is not a stable
and/or supported feature of xitami, but only something that could work if
everything is perfect and the planets are aligned just right <g>?

This may be a feature I have to have, so I want to exhaust all possible
methods with xitami before starting the undesirable task of looking for a
new web server.

Thanks!

SSI seems like a good idea but I notice that almost nobody uses
it. Needs grow until you reach a point that SSI either can't do
the job or the overhead chokes your CPU. 

Don't forget you can put the cart before the horse. Instead of a
static page that calls a program, you can call a program that
outputs static text with dynamic inserts. A half-way trick is to
use a Filter. 

I have a filter that reads static HTML and looks for magic tags.
When it finds a magic tag it grabs the parameter, looks for a
matching tag in a database, and inserts the data. That lets me
change a professor's biography and phone number one place and
have it appear on many pages. 

PHP is great for this kind of stuff (I shudda done it that way). 

You can also call a program in cgi-bin that outputs the whole
page, a mix of static and dynamic. The static can be hard-coded
but obviously it may be easier to maintain if it pulls the static
text from a template file (so the HTML maintainer does not step
on any C/Perl/VB code and break it). 

Most on-line ordering systems seem to directly call a cgi-bin EXE
or equivalent.

Back to basics. VERY important: Xitami 2.4 or 2.5 ? 

The SSI handler changed radically between 2.4 and 2.5. 

In 2.4 it was an external Perl script. You need Perl, installed
and working. You can read through the Perl script (it is quite
simple) and see where it may be going astray.  

2.5 is officially "beta" so I have not even peeked at it. (I
drive 20 year old cars so I'm not one to jump on every new
model.) From comments here, 2.5 itself seems as stable as 2.4,
but some frills aren't done yet. In 2.5 the SSI is handled in the
main Xitami code. Apparently nobody uses SSI because I have not
seen much about it here. Again the source code (except in C) is
available for study. 

> the resulting page shows [xitami SSI:]  (the error code format as defined in the SSI page on xitami's configuration page) but I don't know what the error is

What exactly do you see? If you actually see "the error code
format" rather than an error code, my blind-guess is that the C
routine can't find Perl. 

I'm confused by Ewen's comments and will post to him. 

Marc's idea to use a SCRIPT tag may be off the mark. That would
seem to run on the Browser, not the Server. For a "Hello world",
that might be cool, except a Win32 EXE won't work on Mac or unix,
and Win-users may object to running your (possibly malicious)
code on their machine (I don't think any Win browser actually
will run an EXE as a SCRIPT). For a counter, it is no good
because the count has to be kept on your server, not on hundreds
of browsers. If you "want to create a drop down list in a form
from items in a database" on your server, obviously the EXE has
to run on your server (or have some magic way to run on the
client while accessing your server database, which is really
doing it the hard way).

No.  The "/cgi-bin" is stripped off, and then the CGI-BIN directory is
placed in front of what remains.  Looking at the way it is stripped off,
it _might_ work with a full URL, coincidentallly, if the URL names the
same site, but I'm not sure that's particularly portable.

Paul.
   Thanks for all the comments.  I "upgraded" to v2.5 after spending quite
awhile getting 2.4 stable, because a previous post of mine regarding SSI
indicated that I needed 2.5 to do so.  I'll admit that 2.5 has been stable
for me now, although I rewrote my own Win-services routine (the NT service
version of xitami has been faulty for me as far back as I can remember).
    I don't do PERL, PHP, or other scripting language...to me that would be
taking big steps backwards, but all of my dynamic content is generated with
the Win32 executables.  This offers tremendous power for me, but making
small changes to an otherwise static page can be a big job.  I'm a network
guy by trade, but I have a lot of programming experience too.  Web servers
are new to me and I haven't had the time to really examine all the things
they can do.  Your filter idea is really intriguing, but the documentation
for xitami is much like a Microsoft manual -- there is a huge assumption
that the reader has a PHD in web servers -- not the best assumption in my
opinion, but I have to admit that xitami is by far the best server I've used
regardless of the cost.
    My main objective is to simplify the html generation process.  While I
can hard code all the dynamic pages, I'm sure there is a better way to do
it, and that is my quest.  Any/all comments (preferably with the assumption
that I don't do this for a living) are greatly appreciated!

Thanks again!

I could not make the "built-in" Xitami FTP server to work, so I tried
"Guild FTP"... it was VERY easy to set up, and I got it to work 5
minutes after download (I use W2K behind a DSL Router).. It works very
nicely with the Xitami web server.

And it's Freeware... i downloaded it here: http://www.nitrolic.com/

>Marc's idea to use a SCRIPT tag may be off the mark. That would

>that might be cool, except a Win32 EXE won't work on Mac or unix,

The first (and most normal) use of the script is for placing javascript on 
the page.
The browser expects that what it reads from the file is javascript.
It's like an <img src= ...> tag, but instead of loading an image, it loads 
javascript code.

I use lots of <script src= ...> for including logo's, footers and so on on 
my pages.
When something changes, i only have to modify one sigle script and all the 
pages calling that script are modified accordingly. It's like CCS 
(Cascading Style Sheets).
For instance, place following code on a html page and look for the results:
<script src=http://www.idemdito.org/mailing.js></script>

Now the fine thing about it, is that the browser expects javascript code, 
whatever the extension is. If you call <script 
src="http://web.verfaillie.com/cgi-bin/c"></script>, Xitami will execute 
the code (AND NOT SEND IT TO THE BROWSER) and send the results to the client.

The only minus is that it takes longer to process a <script> (when the 
script is called for the first time) than a SSI because the script code has 
to be fetched from the server. For the subsequent calls, the browser cache 
is used.


>and Win-users may object to running your (possibly malicious)
>code on their machine (I don't think any Win browser actually

Xitami won't send the code to the clients if the code resides in the 
cgi-bin derectory.

You _should_ be able to rename this by editing xitami.cfg, in the [WSX]
section, and changing the "admin=xiadmin" entry to something else, eg
"xitamiadmin=xiadmin".  I'm not certain that everything there is set up
so that it can be renamed, but if you remove that entry then it should
be completely gone.

Note: you'll have to edit xitami.cfg (which we don't usually recommend),
rather than trying to override it in defaults.cfg; there is a bug
reported for this (ie, that it should be possible to disabled WSXes in
defaults.cfg)

I've installed the free trial of xitami pro 2.4c3 to give a testdrive to
SSL, certs and so on.
(OS: w2ksp2 and w98 on 4 different machines intel and amd architecture -
same result). As a regular server on port 80  it works fine, but when I
access secure port 443 it fails to serve pages and issues an error. However
the server does not crash and continues serving requests on port 80. Setting
debug=1 in sslhttp.cfs for some reason leaves no trace.

The date representation is strange in xitami.log. But it doesn't seem to be
the reason as changing system date to 1999 doesn't correct the issue. The
most puzzling thing for me is that I remember that I got it working once a
year ago or so. Now I can't. Can other software conflict xipro? How can I
get it working?
Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

curious, yeah?
:) it was too stupid to mention it - I was playing with portbase earlier and
had a link to http://localhost:8080, then I changed port to 443 in the link,
and yep I forgot to change protocol to https. So the browser was requesting
http and I didn't notice that at first. Console said something strange (at a
first glance) but now when I figured out what was wrong I understand what
console was sayng - it's always like that :)

Why? Perl was made for extracting info from databases and formatting it
for text printers (or files or streams). PHP is like Perl embedded in
HTML. 

If it is a matter of not abandoning the EXEs you have already built: use
PHP to build most of the page as HTML and use the PHP function to call
an EXEcutable where you already have a tool. 

Getting back to your concept: in X2.4 there is a test-file TESTSSI.SSI.
You need Perl for the SSI feature to work in X2.4. On my WinNT server,
this line works fine: 

Output of CGI program: 
 <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe?arguments"--><BR>

On my machine: 
 TESTSSI.SSI is in C:\Webpages
 Testcgi.exe is in C:\Xitami\cgi-bin

Testcgi is an EXE program supplied by Xitami that simply prints some
environment variables as HTML. 

> Your filter idea is really intriguing

So try it. Put a copy of DOS SORT.EXE in \Xitami\cgi-bin. Write a HTML
file that prints several different lines of text, and call it TEST.SRT
and put it in your web folder.  

In defaults.cfg, add a line to tell Xitami what to do with an SRT file
(feed it to SORT): 
   [Filter]
    .SRT=c:\xitami\cgi-bin\sort.exe
    .ssi=c:\xitami\perlssi

In a browser, open localhost\TEST.SRT. Xitami should feed the file to
SORT and send it to your browser. The output will be a Mess, because
your browser will be baffled by out-of-order HTML tags and will probably
re-wrap lines. But you should see that your multi-line text comes back
alphabetized by the first character on each line.

If you like making EXEs.... write one that reads Standard In, replaces
all occurrences of "Large" with "Colossal!!!", and writes to Standard
Out. Write a HTML file with the word "Large" in it, save it in your web
folder with a unique file extension. Set Xitami's filter configuration
to feed that extension to your EXE in cgi-bin. Open that file through
the server and see that all your "Large" products are now "Colossal!!!" 

The next step, replacing some unique string or tag with data from
elsewhere, is left as an exercise.  

> Win32 executables.  This offers tremendous power for me, but making
small changes to an otherwise static page can be a big job.  

That's a good summary. However Perl/PHP come with functions directly
aimed at database reporting and text formatting, are typically far
easier to change than an EXE, and can call an EXE if that is the best
way to do it.

No, Xitami can't do this (listen on two ports at once).  (It'd be handy, 
but it can't at present.)

BTW, Xitami/Pro will list on port 80 (http) and port 443 (https) at
once, since it supports SSL.  Xitami itself doesn't support SSL though;
it's a feature only in the Pro version.

The typically solution to listening on two ports at once is to run two
copies of Xitami.  Providing they're in different directories, and have
all the other services disabled/moved to different ports (FTP, LRWP,
etc) they should work together.

Message-ID: <005b01c18740$6e8c7500$1564a8c0@troy.ozin.foo>

 Hi, I've been using Xitami now for 6 months on W2k. Yesterday I 
 downloaded v2.4d9 (service) and I'm confused about three things now:
 
 1. The web site is a bit of a mess when it comes to indicating 
 which is the current download. For instance the home page 
 (www.xitami.com) gives 2.4d9 as production and 2.5b5 as beta. 
 Whereas the Xitami link on www.imatix.com takes you to 
 http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm#download where it 
 says that production is 2.5b4 and beta is the same?
 
 Also tonight the button links on the right of 
 http://download.xitami.com/ point to the wrong pages and thus 
 give errors.
 
 2. Prior to the download I was using the non-service version. 
 Something that seems to have changed is that Dir-script = seems 
 to be completely ignored now. You can't assign a template and 
 you can't use graphics in directory listings.
 
 3. The bug that is supposed to be fixed (using dos device names) 
 is not fixed. It is much harder to break but eventually I can 
 break it. COM2  did it for me last night.

 Actually It is not hard to break at all. I can now crash the 
 service at will by typing http://<mydomin>/lpt1 and pressing 
 refresh in my browser 6 times in a row quickly. The service 
 completely hangs and cannot be stopped or terminated. I had to 
 reboot until I discovered pskill.exe from system internals' web

OK 2 things - when I say:

 http://<mydomin>/lpt1

you need to substitute one of your domains for <mydomain> above.

If you did that then are you running v2.4d9 as a W2K service? I eventually
get page not found and then find the server refuses to serve anymore pages
untill I kill the service with pskill.

I've investigated further and it also happens with device PRN but not COM1
or COM2. So I suspect this may be connected to the server in question
actually having a device hanging off LPT1. SP2 by the way.

Interesting.  The current "fix" for the device names issue is to ask
Windows "is this a file" once we have opened the path in question.   If
it Windows says anything other than "this is a file", then we close it
and pretend we never saw it!

I'd be interested to know if the answer to that question is being
affected by whether there is something connected to the device or not.
(Eg, if you unplug whatever is plugging into LPT1/PRN does it still
happen?)

I'd also be interested if anyone else can reproduce it.

That is interesting. On all devices, sometimes I get a blank page returned
and sometimes I get a proper error message returned.

OK, physically removing the printer's cable does not help (still dies). But
removing it completely from Control Panel/Printers (or moving its port)
solves the problem completely.

Actually moving it to LPT2, in the OS and then issuing
http://<mydomin>/lpt2 does not bring the service down either but then I
haven't actually got a physical LPT2 so this may be an issue only when you
physically have a known device assigned to a real hardware port.

I have a w2k pro machine with Sp1 can't get this to occur, but I don't 
have a printer attached to lpt1, so this could eb why. I did notice that 
doing a dir>prn in a CMD prompt caused the machine to spike to ~70% CPU 
(from essentially 0) with no output for a couple of minutes. The CMD 
never seems to return even though the CPU goes back down to 0

I also noticed that Xitami takes ~1 second to give a 403 to pages like 
/aux or /com1 whereas its in the milliseconds to give the 404 for 
/nothere.htm

I'm trying to figure our how to password protect a sub directory of cgi-bin.
For example,
I want "/cgi-bin/music" to be protected so that only trusted users can run
the scripts
in there.  Adding the following:
   [/cgi-bin/music]
         friendly = "users"

To defaults.aut does not do it. I am not prompted for a password when runing

OK so the DoS bug I reported is being investigated I think, now can anyone
answer my other query about v2.4d9 (as a W2k service)

Prior to v2.4d9 I was using the non-service version. Something that seems to
have changed is that Dir-script = seems to be completely ignored now. You
can't assign a template and  you can't use graphics in directory listings.
Is this a bug or by design? If by design is it something with the new
version or because it is running as a service?

Many thanks in anticipation.

As far as I know the Dir-script option was only in the Xitami 2.5 beta
(which includes GSL).  It won't work in Xitami 2.4, because the GSL
support wasn't introduced until the 2.5 development version.  In Xitami
2.4 the directory listings that are generated are hard coded.  You could
perhaps use PHP or similar instead if you want to customise things (ie,
have your own index pages).

Ahh, that is it! Thanks Ewen. I did try 2.5 beta prior to v2.4d9. I went to
the non-beta version because I thought it would fix the DoS problem.

    username1=password1

I have a lot of 20+ users on this folder everithing works fine.

Also be sure to edit the right .aut file
If you use defaults.aut then make sure your config (xitami.cfg or
defaults.cfg) points to this file but not some other
[Security]
    filename=defaults.aut

Another of these annoying 'it works for me' people I'm afraid

In my defaults.cfg I have (amongst other things)
[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

And in defaults.aut I have (amongst other things)
[/cgi-bin/exec]
    user = "password"

Works on 2.5b5 both as localhost and to a remote server

You can even add the Webmask = <ipaddresslist> line if you want to only 
let certain scripts be run by known IP addresses. One thing I have 
noticed is that browsers often remain 'logged in' for a long time so you 
can only retest by closing the browser and restarting then you get the 
login prompt.

Subject: [Xitami] BUG - uppercase subdirs of an Alias - potenial NULL pointer assignemnt
Message-ID: <3C20CF3F.6000500@freesbee.fr>

Just found a lovely bug.

I have (for test purposes!) within my defaults.cfg an alias line
usrlocal = "/usr/local"

(Xitami is installed and runing in /usr/local/xitami-25b5)

I also have a subdirectory from /usr/local/xitami-25b5/webpages called 
UPPERCASE

http://computer/UPPERCASE/ works and returns the directory contents
http://computer/usrlocal/xitami-25b5/webpages/ works and gives the home page
http://computer/usrlocal/xitami-25b5/webpages/UPPERCASE/ gives a 404

The same applies to ftp aliases since they also call the same routine 
(see below)! but if ftproot is set to /usr/local/ for a user then that 
user can go to ftp://computer/xitami-25b5/webpages/UPPERCASE/ just fine

It looks like this is because the http_match_alias () routine in 
smthttpd.c lowercases the buffer for comparison and then returns as the 
 value of char **base the lowercased remainder of the url not the 
equivalent untoughed raminder of the url.

I think the fix would be to keep track of the offset and return that 
instead which means that base would have to be changed from a char** to 
an int *. Alternatively you could set base to &uri[slash-buffer] 
(??should be &uri[slash-buffer-1] if the leading / is absent??)

In looking at this code I think I also see a potential null pointer 
assignment (I think it never actually occurs because this routine is 
always called with a parameter for base) but there seems to be no check 
to see whetehr base == NULL before assigning *base to buffer at line 832 
although there is such a check for line 851

Forgot to mention the workaround : Add a link by "ln -s path alias" in 
the webpages directory.

Note this could lead to infitte recursion down directory trees if not 
careful and it does so in the toy example I just used above

chmod, etc, are not implemented in Xitami's FTP server -- it's a fairly
basic FTP server intended for anonymous-FTP and some basic webpage
uploads.

If you need more advanced features I suggest you disable Xitami's FTP
server and install another one with the extra features you need.

I'm having a slight problem getting this to run properly.  I've set the =

php 4.1.0

My problem is this, I have a "Picture Gallery" page written in php that =
you can upload images to, and it is supposed to show these images in the =
image index upon a succesful upload.  I've tested this script on IIS 5.0 =
and it was working fine.  Now when I run it, after the upload, it =
doesn't show the image I just uploaded.  The only way to get the images =
to appear is to open the script, edit it, say add a comment //a or =
something like that, save the script, then refresh the browser.  It's =
almost as if Xitami is not allowing php.exe to be recalled.  It's very =
strange behaviour and I've found no way around it beyond my little edit =
the source code/refresh fixer.  Any ideas on why it would be doing this? =
  Think it could possibly be the Xitami server? =20

I've also noticed that the $PHP_SELF function, doesn't call the =
path/filename, the whole weblink + php script, it only calls the root =
directory.  Here's an Example.

Say:   http://www.someplace.com/picture.php  is called.   Within =
picture.php is a call to $PHP_SELF, which is just supposed to be the =
previous link.  This is not the case tho in Xitami, it ends up being =
http://www.someplace.com/  without the picture.php  So I've had to edit =
a lot of scripts to add the actual file name.  Not sure if this would be =
PHP related, or Xitmai related, but I'd figured I'd mention that too.  =
Any idea's on either of these issues would be greatly appreciated.

Only scripts in some directories are treated as scripts and executed 
locally on the server. Anything else is send to the browser client.
Your script should look at the environment so it can find the output file.
and read your windows manual for topics on execute rights (i'm only working 
with w'98)

    I've had a somewhat similar problem regarding caching. I fixed it in my
case by generating an extra HTTP header, from my PHP source, like this:

header ("Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,
pre-check=0");


	I've also has a similar problem regarding PHP_SELF and portability across
Xitami and Apache. In my case I did this:

// Under Apache $PHP_SELF is what we want, under Xitami it is $SCRIPT_NAME
// We find out based on which one has ".php" in it.
if (ereg ("\.php", $SCRIPT_NAME)) $GLOBAL_SELF = $SCRIPT_NAME;
else $GLOBAL_SELF = $PHP_SELF;
$GLOBAL_SELF = str_replace ("\\\\", "/", $GLOBAL_SELF);

	and then I use $GLOBAL_SELF

	Hope it helps

Just tested the header suggestion, works like a charm, thanks a million :)
I will keep in mind the second one for future scripts, as I've already done
it the hard way with the current ones :)

   You are right, I know absolutely nothing about which
scripts do what. A few pointers in the right direction
would be helpful. I'm testing out Xitami at www.bd4u.com
I'm looking for replacements for what I'm currently getting
from CJB. I've already found CGI script replacements
for everything except Chat. I use mIRC alot, and would like
to tap into thier client base as well. Anybody with any
suggestions, specificly for Xitami?

  I like Xitami, it's short and sweet, and delivers quite alot.
The fact that it doesn't even use MS network software 
to run it is another plus. I'm running the server on a 
486 at 132 Mhz with PCI bus connected with 10/100 PCI
netcard  to 512k DSL. On a WIN95 platform with 48 Megs of ram. 
It runs smooth as silk. I'm very satisfied with it's performance so
far, and so are many of my associates. One of whom is
probably downloading a copy right now.

  So much for the intro, anybody know which IRC chat
works best with Xitami? There sure are alot to choose from..

Subject: [Xitami] access log
Message-ID: <rd482u8frbnkpeki9c1ebctffvnspk2md9@4ax.com>

Security question:


   This access log looks like a collection of hack attempts.
Is this true? They ALL appear to be calls to files and directories
that don't even exist. Resulting in 404, and 304 error codes. That is
if I'm looking at it correctly..

   Any idea why somebody would try to use or look for "Mozilla".

   Alot of calls to WINNT directory. Funny I don't have WINNT
running! Too bad I haven't figured on a reliable way to run a server
from W4WG yet. I bet that would really confuse somebodies sockets.
Which was one of the things that drew me to Xitami to begin with.

:-)

-Tales from the Dark Side no doubt. 


:-(

I'd like to hear them anyway..

Subject: [Xitami] FTP log
Message-ID: <nf682uc4pk2u73j59vf6hqo4il67fdeb42@4ax.com>

Is there an FTP log somewhere in Xitami
that will tell me which files are being transfered
from \ftproot\pub and when?

   What would be a good way to collect, store, and
delete old log files in Xitami. Thankfully the default is
to wipe them clean daily, which saves room. But doesn't
do much for analyzing the data. Nor does it actually delete
the dailies, it only empties them, at least that is what I see
anyway.

   Suggestions or info are welcomed..

Bruce

   OK, upon closer inspection I see two different log files
being saved as dailies. I guess I better put a maintenance
batfile together to do something with them. But should I
be getting two? One with " _000" on the end of the filename, 
and nothing inside it? Maybe it's a result of me trying to set
up the VHost, which will no doubt become another of my Xitami
for Dummies questions.

   Don't ya'll just luv people who ain't got a clue?

   Hey, I'm a hardware technician, not a Network Guru.
Anybody with some specifics on the log files? Please
don't keep quiet just cuz I don't know what I'm looking at..

Bruce if you want you can change the log file so it will rotate weekly or
what have ya.  Also A good program that is out there (shareware) isOpen Web
Scope.  Gives good graphics and details for me.

The link is http://www.openwebscope.com/
Hope this helps.

The FTP log is maintained in the access log, same with HTTP. I believe FTP errors are in the errors.log.
Do an FTP to your site, then check the access log. You'll see your actions.

Since you didn't post a snippet, we must guess what you are
seeing.

However, for the last few months, 95% of my errors.log and much
of my access.log is CodeRed, Nimba, or hack-scripts.

It is quicker for scripters to just try to access it than to
figure out what O/S you are on. That (invalid) URL will produce
no response or a 404 on most machines, but un-patched infected MS
IIS webserver will give a response (typically DIR). Hackers can
grep the script's output and quickly gleen a list of machines
worthy of further attention.

What does PHP stand for?
I see it referenced alot, but haven't
run upon a definition yet. Apparently
it has something to do with script
languages. It needs to be installed
to run from what I've been reading
so far. Can somebody please explain
further? Does it support WIN/95, any
chance of a 16 bit version? Sorry,
gotta ask due to the flaws of 32 bit
memory wraping. Realizing fully well
that Linux offers the only plausable
solution for a 32 bit OS. Still it's 32 bit.
I'd like to see something in 64 bit one
day besides hardware, and game 
cartridges.


Is PHP an acronym for Perl maybe?

IIRC originally "Personal Home Pages".  It's a scripting language.

See http://www.php.net./

It's evolved a lot since its "Personal Home Pages" origin.  The current
"official" expansion appears to be "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" (which
is a recursive acronym).

It's got nothing much to do with perl, although some of the syntax is
the same.

>Does it support WIN/95, any chance of a 16 bit version? 

There is a version for Windows, which ought to work on Windows 95 AFAIK.
There's almost certainly not a 16-bit version though -- 16-bit Windows
is _very_ old (7-8 years now), and not much is still supporting it.

These are recorded in the same log as the HTTP transfers -- as far as
Xitami is concerned, it's all just files :-)

You can configure Xitami to rotate the log files daily (weekly/monthly),
and save them.  Then you can have an external program process them into
pretty reports (analog, webalizer, webtrends, et al), and something else
archive them later.

Well, don't let the name fool you.  It actually stands for Personal Home
Page.  It was originally intended to be a simple cut down version of perl so
that home page users could put some scripting into their regular html pages.
But, the implementation of it grew in popularity over the years, and
webmasters started using it.  Since it was open source, it was contributed
to quickly. And, some will argue that it is at least as powerful as Perl
itself if not more now.

At least that is what my SAMs book says about it.

iHTML used to be called MivaMia and is very similar to cgi scripting. I'm
fairly sure you can get it to work with xitami (I did it back in the day when
it was called by its original name), however, iHTML is not well supported
everywhere as a programming language. There are plenty of other languages out
there that work like iHTML (but better supported) for example: C or Perl CGI
scripting, JSP, PHP,ASP, Python and ColdFusion.

OK, so If I download and install Sleepycat Berkley DB2

for the WEBpages, including some of those IRC

how do some of these people license thier scripts?
Is there a compiler for it too, to prevent piracy? Noticed

Hello

You should be lucky you are using Xitami and not a microsoft server.
There are attempts by virusses to get information out of your computer or 
to run programs on your server.
Since the virusses target microsoft windows servers and these servers 
mostly use win nt, the virusses are trying to get access to the windows nt 
system directory.

These need not be a concern unless you decide to switch to Microsoft's IIS.
They are attempts to exploit a vulnerability in that web server to gain access
to the webserver machine itself.

With Xitami we don't have those worries, as Xitami is _not_ vulnerable to
those attacks.

PHP is just another programming language for CGI.

PHP code is written directly into the HTML code, parsed by the server and
then replaced by the output of the program.

One strength of PHP seems to be database interaction.

Same as Perl, PHP is a scripting language that is not compiled.

PHP is available for all major (and many minor) Servers and operating
systems.

As far as I know PHP has been developed especially for CGI tasks and has
many built in commands for these - unlike other programming languages such
as Perl, C, etc., where you need libraries, modules or individual hard
coding.

Why don't you download PHP, install it and see for yourself? There are very
good tutorials in the web. When downloading, you will find out if there is a
16-bit version too. The official website is http://www.php.net/.

Good luck,

Hugo

How does PHP work (or not) with JavaScript.  Neither of them is compiled.

If you want to do something fancier than CGI forms for interactivity with a
database, can PHP interact and coexist with JavaScript interfaces??

What do you mean by "...something fancier than CGI forms..."?

While Javascript is (in almost all cases) executed inside the browser
(client side), PHP is executed on the server (server side). So the browser
"talks" to the server in Javascript and the server "replies" in PHP (which
is a somewhat misleading description because the server only returns HTML
code which has been generated by parsing the PHP upon the browsers request
generated by Javascript on in another way).
Inside a document, PHP and Javascript are distinguishable by their enclosing
tags. So they can both, coexist and interact. It works as well (or even
better) as communication by a mixture of letters, email, fax, phone and
personal meetings.

Go to www.php.net and read the tutorial for beginners. This will help you
much more because then you can actually see PHP.

Good luck,

Hugo

Hi All,

Merry Christmas!

I am running Xitami under Windows 2000 server.  My
Internet connection is DSL with one static IP address
and Proxy by a Linksys router.  I am trying to run 2
or more copies of Xitami on my PC, so each Xitami will
handle a single domain.

1.   The Xitamis are installed in 3 seperate folders
(ie. C:\Xitami;  C:\Xitami1\; c:\Xitami2).

2.    I changed the port base in xitami.cfg to 1000,
2000 for C:\Xitami1 and  c:\Xitami2 respectively.

3.    The port addresses are showing up as 1080 & 2080
on the console.

However, do connectivity!  After the 3 copies of
Xitami are switched and running!

when I tried localhost, Xitami under c:\Xitami
connects.
when I tried localhost:1080, Xitami under c:\Xitami1
failed to connect.
when I tried localhost:2080, Xitami under c:\Xitami2
failed tp connect.

Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated.

Thanks
Peter

Peter,
   Are you aware that 1 copy of Xitami will host many different domains on a
single IP address?  On one server alone (with 1 copy of Xitami) I am hosting
over 50 separate web sites, all completely independent of each other
including separate log files.

Just an FYI in case you didn't know you could do this.

   Hey Joe, yeah cool..


   That was my next question on the list of questions
I have for Xitami. This V Host stuff is ALL knew to me,
but I know it's all about seperate accounts, and domains
even. Configuring multiple accounts can be tricky I'm
sure, U got any pointers U would like to share? Anything
pop into your mind to be mindful of in the setup? Are there
some things U have to remember to set for ALL accounts
that U could list? Anybody else wanna contribute on this 
thought?

   Heck I know, basicly with DSL I can actually have
as many as 250 "different" connections, now whether or not
I'm prepared to service that many connections at once
is seriously questionable. But I know in theory that I could,
and that Xitami could take me a long ways towards reaching 
that number. I had 8 connections of continuous downloading all at 
once. It put a strain on the little 486, but Xitami was pumping it
as fast as the PCI bus could deliver it. The DSL was a constant
flicker of lights. It was kinda like "christmas" again for the very
first time.

Hi Joe,

I am aware of that, and I have tried but unsuccessful.  Trying to run
multiple Xitami with different port addresses was a result of my failure to
run a single copy of Xitami with mulitple domains.

I must have been doing something wrong, are there documentations for
newbies?  Would love to set it up point all my domains to the Xitami.

Merry Xmas,
Peter

Peter (and Bruce)
     The thing that brought me to Xitami first was the easy way it handled
multiple domains.  I sell DSL service and had to offer web hosting to be
competitive.  Xitami was a perfect fit, especially for the price!  The
easiest way to create a virtual host is by using the VHost Wizard from the
main menu of the Web Based Administor (http://localhost/admin).  Looking at
the VHost configuration page:

1. Virtual host profile: (The configuration file created for all custom
settings for this domain).  I use the top level domain name less the
extension. (ie. for imatix.com I would use imatix).  The extension .cfg is
automatically used.

2.  Over-write existing file:  There usually isn't one, but if there is,
check this to replace the old configuration file.

3.  Select IP Address:  If you have multiple NICs and you only want one for
Web hosting, select it here, otherwise (default) let Xitami use "All" IP
addresses.

4.  Or DNS Host Name.  Enter the Web address here, ie: www.yourdomain.com

5.  Web Page root directory:  The location on your drive where the web site
pages are stored.  This is the directory where your customer has FTP access
to update page in.

6.  cgi-bin directory:  I usually cut-n-paste the directory above and add
\cgi-bin to it.  You can point this to any directory where you want where
cgi scripts for this domain are allowed to run.

7.  FTP root directory:  I don't use Xitami's FTP server, but I assume this
is the "home" directory for the admin of this domain.  (same as #5 I would
guess)

The rest of the items are pretty self explanatory.  I usually let Xitami
create the above directories for me.  Once you save it, you need to restart
the server and your all set!  The DNS entries for the domain only needs to
have a CNAME or A record for www.yurdoamin.com (which is normally a default)
that points to your public IP address.  My default, xitami will try to use a
page named 'default.htm' when no specific page name is specified on the
address line.  If that fails, it will look for index.htm.  You can change
and add to these in the VHost configuration screen.  If you look in the
xitami directory, you will find configuration files (and .aut security
files) for each host (domain).  These can be manually edited just like the
default file, or you can do all your maintenance through the web based
administration app.

Its all very easy, even though it looks complicated at first site.  Once you
get two domains running, you'll be off setting up web sites for all your
friends!  (just make sure you charge them something....xitami may be free,
but bandwidth isn't!!)

Joe, thanks for your helpful post. I am new to Xitami, just learning to do my own hosting, so your comments are helpful. I did get beyond VHost creation, so you are right, after a couple of them others are easy to set up.

I will need to create a SSL for my server. If you have tips on how to do it (I am not knowledgeable at this point), could you please refer me to a good source on this? Explanations are welcome, of course.

Thanks a lot,

Thanks, Joe

   Any word on Passwords for the remote uploads?
That's what got me stumped last, when I went to the account
via ftp: uh-oh.. I also noticed alot of submenus in the V Host
setup, they got confusing. I think I ended up setting FTP for them
or something, I got confused quickly which portions of setup
needed to be "set up" for a V Host account.

Bruce,
   Can't help you there.  I never liked the way xitami implemented FTP.  I'm
of the old school anyway....a program ought to do one thing, and do it very
well.  Web hosting and FTP are not in the same ballpark.  I have used SERV-U
FTP server for years.  The new version (I don't see any great improvement)
jumped way up in price, but all previous versions sold for $30.00.  Really
hard to beat.  You can do what you want, but for me, I'd rather have a
separate FTP server and not worry about mixing configurations.

--Joe

I have the following problem using the web based administration on Xitami
for Linux.  When I make setting changes via the web admin screens the
settings do not stick.  If I manually modify the cgf files using the pico
editor, the setting stick.  I'm using the save buttons, restarting the
server, but no changes stay.

I agree with you.  I use CesarFTP (fir FTP) which is free at present, 
easy to use and works reliably.

Xitami is a great Web server.

   Nice Job on the WEBpages
there Gus, might I suggest a
Left edge nonscrollable frame
for an index. And getting rid of 
tables all together. Just a thought.

www.bd4u.com running Xitami
on a 486 with PCI bus WIN95
512k DSL it does the job.


   Actually the original question was
concerning password sessions with
remote users. I mean it would be a
wise move maybe, and I was wondering
about setting them for servicing thier own
domain. Which was part of my original
question about Which settings for
V Host, like passwords. I think
maybe U set them up after U set up
the Directories, cause until then, U
ain't got nuthin to password for.
Are there some specifics somebody would
like to add. I sure hope Xitami is
capturing all this good questions, cause I'll
only be a dummy for awhile, and then
I'll no longer be asking these "Xitami for
Dummies" questions.

Well, Windows XP has an Incoming Connections feature (the Network Setup
Wizard should be able to set that up) which by the sound of it is what you
want.

Is there a solution yet to the /AUX type problem? I am running Windows ME. I
have tried both the latest production version and the Beta version and this
problem still exists.

This one has been a known problem long enough that I thought it would have
been solved by now. I'm about ready to look elsewhere for software.

Any solution?

I remember having this same problem when first using Xitami. The solution,
in my case, was to click the Save icon (sometimes more than once if you are
on one of the sub-configuration pages) until the main Xitami Administration
page is displayed -- then click Restart Server. I found that clicking the
Restart icon on any of the configuration pages would lose the changes.

I will recheck when I return to the office and a win ME machine but I 
have personally been unable to reproduce the problems with 25b5 on win 
98 or win2k.

If you can reproduce it consistently you should give details of the 
machine config etc.

You are running 2.4d9 or 2.5b5 and still getting the problem?  (All
earlier versions will have the problem; these are the latest release and
beta versions available from http://www.xitami.com/)

If there are still problems with 2.4d9 with /AUX, et al, then we want to
konw.  But given how the device detection handling works in Xitami
2.4d9/2.5b5 I'm rather puzzled as to how it can be falsely being
not detected as a device.

If you're running a webserver on a linux system and want to use the
standard ports (80, etc), then you need to start the webserver as root
-- only root has the ability to open those ports. 

I suspect you'll find that's what's going on, rather than that there is
some other program using those ports.

Here is the basic info about my system. What else do you need to know?

System Properties says "Microsoft Windows Me 4.90.3000"

Currently have Xitami v2.5b5. I had the problem first in 2.4d9 then tried
the beta with the same results.

IE 5.50.4087.2300 update version sp2

When I access 127.0.0.1/aux it locks the system and forces a reboot via the
reset switch - end task does not solve the problem.

This is different from the "device bug" in Xitami -- that just caused
Xitami to crash (and sometimes required the machine to be rebooted
before Xitami could be started again, but the machine was still usable).

So it sounds like something different is going on.

Can anyone else reproduce this issue on another version of Windows?
(There were bugs like this -- accessing a device in the "wrong" way
could crash Windows -- in previous versions of Windows 95 and maybe
98, and there were patches available from Microsoft to fix it; but I'd
have thought these'd have been fixed by Me.)

Response

With Windows, if installing, ununstalling and fiddling ... consider
a clean format of the drive and a fresh install with all known (by you)
to work device drivers.    

The build of the OS ... in particular those
builds that 'burn' the OS image onto the drive ... can make a big difference.

Your weird behaviour is an indication of a need to service pack the OS
or rebuild it fresh.

Always good to ChkDsk the hard drive on a crash and certainly ... delete your
temp files.

Win 95, 98 and ME are not ideal environments for servers. ( In particular when you got
the MP3 jamming)

I'd look at the OS.

Dear List

This is a wierd one:

If I ftp across the network, PC to PC, no problem.
If I ftp from my iBook to my desktop, via ethernet crossover cable and 
static non-routable class C addresses, no problem.
But if I ftp from my iBook across the internet I can log on and chdir, 
but I every time I try to NLST, it times out. I've tried 3 different ftp 
clients to the same (non) effect.

Any ideas?

Bruce.

Do you have a firewall in between the Internet and your Xitami server?  
It looks a whole lot like the data channel connection is being blocked
by your firewall.  You might want to try active mode FTP (there's a
slightly better chance of it working in the case of the FTP server being
behind a firewall); most programs default to passive mode these days
(because it's got a better chance of working when the _client_ is behind
a firewall).

(And yes, if both the client and server are behind different firewalls
it is quite possible for FTP to be completely broken, so that neither
passive or active FTP will work.  Don't use FTP.  Use HTTP.  It's much
cleaner.)

HTTP uses a single connection from client->server for all transfers
(originally one per file transfered, but HTTP/1.1 allows more than one
file transfer per connection).  It can be easily proxied/cached, and easily
allowed specifically through a firewall.  All meta information is passed
in a clean, extendable, set of headers on the request and the response.

FTP uses two connections, a control connection and a data connection
(well, one data connection per file transferred).  The control
connection is used to set up the data connections, and no much else.
FTP has two modes: active FTP (the original) where the data connection
goes from sender to receiver (so if the server sends you a file, it
opens a connection back to you), and passive FTP (a later work around)
where the data connection goes from client to server (always).  

FTP picks the port numbers for the data port "at random" (some FTP
clients/servers can be told to be more specific, but in general you
can't assume what the port numbers will be).

So FTP is very hard to firewall.  A firewall at the client end will
generally break active FTP (won't allow the data connection to come
in), unless the firewall specifically knows about FTP and takes special
precautions.  A firewall at the server end will often break active FTP (if
the server isn't allowed to connect back out again), and will generally
break passive FTP as well (since it'll only allow incoming connections
to ports it knows about, and the data connections are chosen "at random").

FTP is also difficult to proxy (at least in the sense of a FTP proxy
that looks like a FTP server on one side and a FTP client on the other), 
since the proxy has to implement pretty much all of the FTP server
behaviour (cf a HTTP proxy which just passes the connections through
with some extra headers).

FTP has no reliable way to return date/time meta information about
files; each FTP client "guesses" this information from directory
listings, after having guessed what the directory listing format is.
HTTP specifically includes this information in its answer.  HTTP has a
"get if modified" request; the equivilent in FTP involves getting a
directory listing, guessing the format, guessing the details of the
file, comparing it with what you have, and hoping for the best.

There's plenty more.  But basically FTP was designed by a bunch of grad
students 20-something years ago making it up as they went along to solve
a much more general problem than was really required, in an environment
security and firewalls weren't an issue.  HTTP was designed more
recently (about 10 years ago), and is much more firewall friendly.

For single file transfers HTTP is more efficient (only one connection
setup); for multiple file transfers FTP doesn't look quite so bad, but
HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connections can give HTTP an edge even there.

Use HTTP.

I remember having this same problem when first using Xitami. The solution,
in my case, was to click the Save icon (sometimes more than once if you are
on one of the sub-configuration pages) until the main Xitami Administration
page is displayed -- then click Restart Server. I found that clicking the
Restart icon on any of the configuration pages would lose the changes.

Ewen, I think Bruce was asking "How do I use HTTP for FTP-type
stuff?" rather than "How is HTTP better?"

It isn't quite clear what Bruce is doing. But I turn to FTP for
many small chores. My text-editor has a "Save As... FTP" that
opens an FTP server as if it were a local disk (almost), but no
HTTP protocol there. Sucking a LOT of files from one machine to
another (as when moving a site from one host to another) is
natural in a smart FTP client (WS_FTP understands "move directory
structure" as a sequence of basic FTP commands). 

While I'm dimly aware that HTTP can support all this, it isn't so
often done. And I thought Xitami did not natively support HTTP
PUT?

One more piece of info in case it helps. I set up my old computer in the
garage and dialed in to my ISP. This way I was on a different machine. I
connected via the url for my dynamic IP account with no trouble. I have not
done any other setup except a minor change to the default page so I could be
sure to recognize it. This worked fine. I tried some other / items such as
"/hello" and got the expected "can't display" error message.
I then tried /aux and also got the error message. I went back and forth a
few more times and got results I would expect.

Interestingly when I went back to my main 'server' PC it was locked and
required a power off. Thus it would apprear that it was working even though
the PC was locked???????

127.0.0._2_?  That's a fairly unusual address to be using.  Are you sure
you don't mean 127.0.0.1?  You might want to try pinging the IP address
you're trying to use first, to make sure the computer can see it.  As
well as any details from the IE error message (turn off the "friendly"
error messages to get the real deal as to what is going wrong).

Well I only use Xitami for testing things offline. I have two websites ie
Domain names so I set up one on

127.0.0.2 praying.cfg

and the other

127.0.0.3 hinchliffe.cfg

I am using the Virtual Hosts page to do this. Is this not the correct way
of doing things?

I solved my problem thanks to your help anyway. Once I turned of the
(un)helpful messages I got

Internal error: your request was unsuccessful 
Cannot create CGI process - program not found

So I knew I had not got Perl and PHP installed properly and now I am up and
running find again. Thanks a lot.

I have now just reproduced Jason's bug. http://localhost/lpt1 kills 
xitami if a printer is installed on win2k

http://localhost/aux gives 403 as one might expect. However the lpt1 
problem only seems to apply to localhost. In otherwords a remote machine 
doing http://myhost/lpt1 gets the expected 403

Thank you.

I did find that if I'm root Xitami does startup on port 80.

So I tried putting /pathto_xitami/xitami in my rc.local file at startup, and 
it doesn't start.  :-(

> which distro of linux are you using?

Mandrake 8.1, which I'm utterly disgusted with right at this moment.  
Upgraded the kernel which required a new iptables.  Installed the .rpm's from 
mandrake and now they tell me I need to:

Dec 29 09:11:48 bastille-firewall: iptables v1.2.4: can't initialize iptables 
table `filter': Module is wrong version 
Dec 29 09:11:48 bastille-firewall: Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to 
be upgraded. 

I'm rebuilding from 2.4.17 from kernel.org in the hopes that that solves this 
problem right now.

If any one has any help to offer with this problem, please contact me off 
this list since this isn't on topic here.

Some place out there there must be a nice small linux distro?  FreeBSD is 
looking better all the time.

Well, if it works for you, by all means keep doing so.  Typically only
127.0.0.1 is actually supported as a loop back interface.  And
name-based virtual hosting (rather than IP address based virtual
hosting) is often the way people use to test multiple sites on a single
IP address.

>I solved my problem thanks to your help anyway. Once I turned of the

:-)  The "friendly" error messages are one of the more annoying features
of IE.  It's a shame they didn't put the friendly message at the top and
then some sort of "technical section" at the bottom of the page with the
real details in it.  This way anyone developing websites/setting up
webservers/whatever has to remember to turn off the "hide error
messages" option (under its other name).

And doesn't if no printer is installed?  (Can someone check this:
temporarily uninstall the printer in Windows, and try again to see if it
locks up.)

I'm wondering if the key difference from the last set of problems is
whether or not there is an actual device (modem, printer, whatever) 
installed on the particular port name in question (aux, lpt, etc).

The fix in Xitami 2.4d9/2.5b4 was to take each filename it was asked to
open, open it, and ask Windows "is this a file?" -- if Windows said
anything other than "yes, it's a normal file", then Xitami closed it
again and backed away quickly (returning 403 etc).  

Possibly this test is either (a) getting an unexpected result when there
is a real device installed, or (b) something about doing the test that
way causes problems when there is a real device installed.

Also, can those who have crashes with "http://localhost/lpt1" please try
"http://localhost/prn" (which ought to be the same device, according to
DOS tradition), and see if it gives the same effect.

Please report:
(a) the exact URL used during testing (including the exact upper/lower 
    case, etc)
(b) the version of Xitami being used (2.4d9, 2.5b5, windows gui, windows
    console, nt service)
(c) the version of Windows you have
(d) what web browser you used (name, and version)
(e) any service packs, patches, etc that you have
(f) what devices you have installed (modem, printer, etc)
(g) what crashes (eg, just xitami so you can kill it off and keep going;
    the OS freezes so you need to ctrl-alt-del and reboot; the OS
    freezes so hard that you can only turn the machine off/hit reset)

If we can figure out what is causing it then, yes, we will fix it.  At
present it doesn't happen for me, which makes it difficult to debug and
fix!

If you want to see a fix, please help out by testing the situations in
which it does happen, to help narrow down what is causing it.  See my
earlier message for the types of details that are helpful, and what to
test.

Just tried, it does.

I'm not keen to do this on an open list. So it's http://www2.xxx.com/lpt1
(but not xxx) and http://www2.xxx.com/prn but the case doesn't seem to
matter as http://www2.xxx.com/LPT1 will also bring it to its knees.

Just to clarify, it doesn't always happen first time, you have to refresh
the page a bit. Also it is NOT restricted to local connections. Remote
connections will bring it down just as easily.

Xitami, stops responding to requests and the service will not shutdown. You
can not force it to shut by using the services applet or by using
taskmanager but you can be using pskill.exe from sysinternals.com. The OS is
not effected.

I was going to ask if you had problems with AUX. 

AUX is the "auxillary device", dating _way_ back to the CP/M days.
It's basically another name for one of the COM ports these days --
that people have problems with AUX and COM1 does not surprise me at all.

I suspect that:
- anyone who has a problem with lpt1 will have the problem with prn, 
  and vice versa
- anyone who has a problem with aux will have a problem with com1 (or 
  perhaps one of the other com ports)

(If anyone has problems with only one of prn/lpt1 or only one of
com1/aux please speak up!)

And as mentioned before, I suspect the issue is now restricted to
situations where the device is actually present (eg, a printer
installed).  

If someone who has the problem with prn or lpt1 could try uninstalling
the printer, and see if the problem goes away, and then try installing
the printer again, and see if the problem returns, that would probably
confirm this part of the hypothesis.

The other interesting factor from your detailed post is that it doesn't
happen every time, only when you've hit refresh a lot.  That screams
"race condition" to me -- ie, that it's only when the access happens at
an "inconvenient" time that the problem occurs.

I've got a vague hunch now as to where the race condition might be _if_ the
problem goes away when the printer is uninstalled and comes back when it
is installed.  (Figuring out how to fix it will be a little more tricky,
but I've got one possibility to try there.  Of course the fact that I
can't reproduce this doesn't make it any easier...)

 NT 4 WKS, sp6a. No printer has ever been installed on this server.

www.domain.com/lpt1

     -- no response back. Attempts with the same browser to access the web server fail.
     -- but ... if I go in with another browser ... Opera ... no problem.

     -- I did not have to reboot Xitami or NT.

www.domain.com/aux

    -- server responds "After repeated attempts ..."
    -- browser kept reading pages from server.


These are my findings. Your mileage may vary.

I advice to download the latest PHP 4.1.0 version because I experience
a great speed-improvement, just as is said on:
http://php.nederland.net/release_4_1_0.php

My server now works with Win95, the xitami 2.5b4 as service

Yes did that before. This was my previous report:

OK, physically removing the printer's cable does not help (still dies). But
removing it completely from Control Panel/Printers (or moving its port)
solves the problem completely.

Actually moving it to LPT2, in the OS and then issuing
http://<mydomin>/lpt2 does not bring the service down either but then I
haven't actually got a physical LPT2 so this may be an issue only when you
physically have a known device assigned to a real hardware port.

I don't think this is the same thing. What if you close the browser and open
it again?

Ok I've now done the definitive test. I created a new printer (generic text
only) and told the OS it was on COM1 (it didn't actually exist you
understand). I then entered www.xxx.com/com1 into Opera and lo and behold it
crashes. The same for AUX. So that is it I'd say. Your theory is correct.

Indeed. Although only the OS has to think it is present it doesn't actually
have to exist if you see what I mean?

Well... yes but don't get too stuck on this as I can make it happen on the
very first go sometimes as well. I did with the COM1 test above.

I've tried:

Probably interesting to know is that only the following shows up in

So, lpt1 does not show up in the access log!

No printer or modem on prn or lpt1, a mouse on com1, I think.

In the latest beta you can use the virtual host wizard from the front
web page.  You can also do it manually in your config file like this:

[Virtual-hosts]
	www.sklep.limit.pl = "skelp.cfg"


The contents of skelp.cfg would look like this:
[Server]
	webpages = "c:\\Xitami\\skelpwww\\"

This [Server] section tells xitami that when a request for
www.sklep.limit.pl is recieved, the files are located in the director
c:\\Xitami\\skelpwww\\"


The wizard is the easiest way to get this setup though.

Okay, it sounds like the fix in 2.4d9/2.5b5 narrows it down to the
situation where:
(a) the device actually exists and is being used (eg, a printer is
    installed); and
(b) the timing of the access is "unlucky"

_Sometimes_ "first go" is fine -- that can still easily be a race
condition, it's just that the timing happened to be right the first
time.

If it was _always_ first time, then it wouldn't be a race condition
(since it'd be repeatable quite easily), but it doesn't sound like
that's the case here.

The "device problem" handling in Xitami 2.4d9/2.5b5 (same code in both;
testing one version or the other is fine folks -- but no earlier
versions have the fix) works like this:

Try to open the path name given
If it opened:
   Ask Windows "what type of file have I opened?"
   If Windows says "a disk file": it's not a device
   If Windows says anything else: it's probably a device, ignore it
If it did not open:
   Assume that it isn't a device

If the path name is not a device:
   Open the file for reading (to start sending the results out)

The catch is that the file is being opened twice, once to check what
type of file it is, and once to actually access the data.
(Unfortunately we need to do this because only the special Windows API
call will let us ask if it is a device file, but everything else in
Xitami uses the more portable C standard file handles.)

If "something changes" between these two situations, so that the first
open fails, and the second one succeeds, then I think we'll get the
problem we're noticing here (at least if the path name is a device
file).

And my guess is the "something changing" is something like another program
having the device open (blocking us out, so we assume it is not a device)
when we first try to find out if it is a device, and but it has closed it
(freeing up the device) by the time we try to open it again to read from
it.

Unfortunately the Windows API documentation doesn't have much detail
about doing this type of test, or what types of errors we can get back
from the first open attempt, so we're left to guess what might happen.
(It would be _really_ handy for instance if the first open gave us an
error of "someone else is using that device right now" for instance,
then we could know if it was a device even if the open failed.)

I've got a couple of ideas to try, although as I commented, I'm somewhat
hampered by the fact that I can't reproduce the problem...

> What is aux anyway? 

In CP/M (before MS-DOS), the devices were CON, PRN, PUN, and AUX. 

CON was (still is) the CONsole: display and keyboard, teletype or
CRT. 

PRN is a printer, and generally Serial (but not always RS-232!)

PUN is the paper-tape punch, to save data on. (I can't remember
if you read tape on the same port or if there was another, RDR?)

AUX was basically "extra", like spare inputs on the back of a
hi-fi amplifier. Usually AUX pointed to the serial port driver. 

IBM had CP/M in mind when they made the IBM PC. The first O/S for
the PC was that thing Gates bought and modified, which IBM sold
as IBM PC-DOS. But IBM had mapped out multiple serial ports and
adopted a parallel interface for the Epson printer they were
re-badging. So the ports had to have more names to cover all the
new possibilities. LPT1 LPT2 LPT3 (and LPT4 on PS/2 BIOS) denote
the parallel ports. For back-compatability, by default PRN points
to the same routine as LPT1. 

A fully IBM compatible PC has a display much faster than any
serial port, and CON defaults there. However you can re-map CON
to a serial port and there is even a utility to do so. I once had
an Intel-made 286 that would run DOS but was -not- IBM PC
compatible: no internal video. On that beast, CON defaulted to
one of the serial ports and DOS and WordStar ran on a terminal. 

There are a LOT of reserved device names in this tradition.
MS-DOS 2+ has CLOCK (or CLOCK$$). And let us not forget NUL.
Win95/WinNT extend this by giving "LPT1.DOS" a special meaning:
much like "LPT1" but not quite.

I'd agree with that.

I'd be surprised if this was the case as it is repeatable on every occasion
and nothing else is using the device, so the "other program" can only be
Xitami itself. One thing I forgot to mention is that in every case where
there is a device present pre-crash I don't get an error page returned, just
a blank page.

Happy to install debug code on my PC if it helps. I suppose your code
automatically denying access to known device names is a no no?

Put it in Xitami's CGI-BIN directory, make sure you have Perl installed,
and that the Perl executable is on your PATH (eg c:\perl\bin is in your
PATH).  If you're running on Windows then Xitami will treat things in
the cgi-bin directory that have a #! line as their first line that
mentions "perl" in it, as perl programs to run; the chmod is not
necessary under Windows (it's a unix/linux thing).

The easiest way is with windows explorer (and you have all the windows 
explorer functionalities, like drag-and-drop).
(sorry for those who are using *nix)

1
Start windows explorer

2
in the address bar type ftp://aaa.bbb.ccc
if you don't have an address bar in we, go to View, Toolbars, and click 
address bar

3
now the right part of the screen is the remote location

4
If you have to log in with login and password, click on File, Login...

It's that easy!

I'm not so sure that nothing else is using the device; amongst other
things Windows is able to monitor the paper status of a printer, and I'm
guessing that involves opening the device, querying the status, and
closing the device again.  Providing a window of opportunity for Murphy
(of Murphy's law fame) to sneak in.

Given the way that Xitami works I'd be surprised if it was Xitami itself
that was blocking its own test out -- there's no thread switching
between the test point and the file open point.  But the OS could switch
to another proram/task.

We tried that before.  The problem is that there are so many,
undocumented, special ways in which Windows can spot the device name in
a longer path, that it rapidly becomes infeasible to properly check for
known device names without also blocking a whole bunch of filenames
which are otherwise valid.

I'll post something here when I've got a test version with a possible
fix/work around in it.

I just started Xitami and don't know a lot about it.  One of the things I
am interested in is using my private machine to let others ftp to me on
the net. I assume I can do this on win 98. I looked in the faq but didn't
see anything that was clear to me.

Basically, I want to know what URL I would give to others to be able to
ftp to my xitami folder. I seem to recall fuzzily that I need an IP
address for my machine, and that some ISPs don't supply a usable IP, but
I also forget how to find that. If you reply assume I am in a total state
of ignorance about this ;')

Yours,

   Thanks Ewen, here is another one for U, if U don't mind.
In the following Perl script snipet, where would the URL
be fit in exactly..

======================>

<a href=\"$guestbookurl\">Guestbook</a>

======================>

Also what do U mean by the term 


>   "have a #! line as their first line"


Which line and where is it found?

I'd imagine that $guestbookurl is defined somewhere towards the top of
the script and should be set to the URL of either the perl script or
some HTML page it generates (depends on how the script works).

That would be the first line :-)  (Of the perl script.)  It should read
something like:

#! /usr/bin/perl

or similar.  For Xitami the important part is that it contains "perl" in
it.

   The above HREF command is part of the Perl script. The helpfiles
say to edit the href command in the Perl script to point to  the  html
file. If by default it's the root, then I figure it might look
something like

<a href=\"$208.33.152.220\guestbook.html">Guestbook</a> 

But I have NO idea of the correct syntax for using in Perl. Does
the above look right? Remember the above is supposed to be
in a Perl script.

   Also if the file resided in the CGI bin, do I add the directory
structure, or will it be found by default of "root", so that all I
need is the filename such as 208.33.152.220\guestbook.pl
for a CGI URL?

Message-ID: <00c201c191b6$93f3ac20$020aa8c0@Master>

1.  #!  is the first line in your perl script.
2.  C:\perl\bin needs to be in your PATH
3.  all perl scripts need to go in your /xitami/cgi-bin directory (or what
ever directory you have designated to hold your CGI files
4.  The URL alias reference would be: <a
href=/cgi-bin/guestbook.pl>Guestbook</a> OR if you wanted the full path it
would be: <a href=http://208.33.152.220/cgi-bin/guestbook.pl>Guestbook</a>
5.  Your reference below is calling an .html file (guestbook.html), not the
perl .pl file

When calling a CGI file you need to call the script itself, in this case the
perl "guestbook.pl" file.  Xitami allows you to define where you are going
to keep your CGI scripts at.  You only get one root location.  By default it
provides you the /cgi-bin directory but you could modify that to
/my_cgi_files or /perl_scripts or what ever you want, assuming that the
directory EXISTS in c:\xitami\.  So when you are calling CGI files through a
href tag the CGI directory needs to be the first directory in the reference
path: <a href=http://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/....>click here</a>.  Xitami see's the
/cgi-bin in the URL call and then goes to the /cgi-bin directory to complete
the rest of the URL reference.

valid calls assuming Xitami defaults (/cgi-bin must be at the beginning of
the path):
<a href=/cgi-bin/file.pl>
<a href=http://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/file.pl>
<a href=/cgi-bin/perlscripts/file.pl> ## /perlscripts is a subdirectory and
it must exist for the URL call to work
<a href=/cgi-bin/blah/blah1/blah2/file.pl>

If Xitami is configured to accept /cgi-bin anywhere in the path:
<a href=/personal/cgi-bin/file.pl>
<a href=http://x.x.x.x/files/yourfiles/cgi-bin/myfiles/perlscripts/file.pl>

hope this helps.

   It's supposed to be calling the guestbook.html file from within the
Perl script. I'm guessing that is the reason for the dollar symbol in
front of the URL. I'll give it a try based on what U already told me.
I should be able to muddle through it, based upon what U have
already said. Thanx..

I've been fighting CGI and it's awful permissions for so long I've
decided to move to PHP. The latest version of PHP integrates
automatically with the Xitami server so you can learn it very easily. Of
course, the one problem is there is still a dearth of good PHP as opposed
to free perl scripts, for things like bulletin boards or group event
calendars, that are the equal of the ones in Perl at Matt's Script
Archive. I  like Perl but I really get tired setting endless permissions
in the cgi-bin.

Anyone know where I might find a good bbs or calendar in PHP?

And speaking of permissions, I was thinking of getting cable so I'd have
a fixed IP and setting up FTP (which I finally figured out).  But just
how secure is the Xitami FTP? It will be open to the world, so I assume
it's nearly impossible for hackers to break out of so they can go ravage
my disk.

Oy, now I've got to learn server security. PHP today, security tomorrow.
It never ends on the web ;')

Happy New Year, by the way.

Yours,

This one will get you started on the PHP road:

There's a bunch of good stuff here:

Hello Folks,

Why is it that the "\n"  and other escape characters in my Perl script are =
not being recognized in the IOExplorer browser?? I start the html code =
with the prescribed  .....print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";..... I'm =
running Win NT 4.0 and perl5 and IOExplorer 5.5.

By the way, after much pain and suffering, I discovered from this Q&A list =
that I had to include the ".pl=3Dapplication/x-http-perl" statement in the =
Mime section and "pl=3DC:\perlpath\perl.exe" in the Filter section of the =
Defaults.cfg file in order to get my NT 4.0 to execute the Perl5 script.=20=

Thanks for that.

Regards to all!

General comment on ftp through cable modems. 
 
My ISP was blocking port 80 but not 21, so I had to use a different www
port (I ended up using 443, ssl port, which got around problems with
some firewalls [a friend's at work] which was blocking unusual ports to
unknown ip addresses)
 
The problem was that Xitami would accept the FTP connection and login on
port "which ever" (other than 21), but when my ftp client asked for a
"list" there was either no response from Xitami, or for some reason my
Linksys cable router, or the cable company was blocking the return list.
I got around it by disabling Xitami's FTP and used another FTP program.
