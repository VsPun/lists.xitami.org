<PRE>In the last few days I have seen several people talk about dynamic name 
services from the likes of dns2go and tzo.com. I am sure they work just 
great but I have never used their services having been a long time user 
of another service that I haven't seen mentioned recently. I stress, I 
am just a user of dyndns and not affiliated with them in any other way!

I use the services of dyndns.org - and having looked at both dns2go and 
tzo.com I would suggest that if you are interested and have a need for 
dynamic IP services you look at what's available from dyndns.org, 
especially from a cost standpoint on the advanced offerings! Everyone, 
including dyndns.org have the free services for basic dynamic IP 
management and will give you a xxxxx.dyndns.org username but the built 
in clients in the LinkSys router and Netgear routers will automatically 
keep your dyndns.org address pointing in the right direction, so to me 
that's a plus (although maybe this is true for the others too... but 
from what I saw on the other sites the client is something you have to 
run on the server itself and if it is a private IP behind a NAT device 
like a Netgear or similar, you may be out of luck!)

The advanced features of dyndns are inexpensive though - just a ONE off 
donation of $30 for each www.yourdomainname.com you want to use and 
you're off and running, managing your own DNS (and they make it easy if 
you are a beginner) that you can always have resolve directly to your 
dynamic IP for anything you want to use it for, including mail (MX) 
support... in fact I have found no real limitations to their services 
at this price... they even support an offline redirect, web hopping 
(for services where port 80 is blocked) and various other tricks.

Anyway, that's all I will say... I am sure dns2go and tzo are great, 
I'm not saying they aren't... but just from what I saw on prices and 
since no one else had mentioned it... I thought I would tell you about 
dyndns.org!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can't do it yourself, unless you order a static IP from
</I>&gt;<i> RoadRunner.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But, that might be expensive (don't know, never checked the price).
</I>&gt;<i>  So,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead,  you can go with an IP forwarding service like
</I>&gt;<i> www.dns2go.com .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You point your URL (with your domain provider (or just use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; www.yourdomain.dns2go.com for free)) to dns2go (They will tell you
</I>&gt;<i> the DNS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IPs).  Then, you run  their client software on your server that
</I>&gt;<i> updates
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dns2go with your current IP.  Then dns2go re-directs all domain
</I>&gt;<i> requests
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your current IP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is one more problem, however.  RoadRunner blocks port 80
</I>&gt;<i> (standard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; html port).  So you have to tell Xitami to run your webserver at a
</I>&gt;<i> port
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6800 or something (read how in the Xitami docs).  You also have to
</I>&gt;<i> tell
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dns2go client software to portforward requests with a www. prefix
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever port you use.  And, bring your FTP port back down to 20
</I>&gt;<i> (see
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; docs).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then, your html URL will be www.yourdomain.com and your FTP URL
</I>&gt;<i> will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="ftp://yourdomain.com">ftp://yourdomain.com</A> .  You have to use the www. prefix or dns2go
</I>&gt;<i> will not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know to portforward html requests to your new html port (6800 or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you picked), and you have to make sure not to use it with FTP
</I>&gt;<i> requests, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dns2go will portforward those to the same port as your webserver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Its all free (and pretty transparent) unless you want email.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; charge a bit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good Luck,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello! There,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have installed xitami-2.4d7 under linux at home network with
</I>&gt;<i> cable(rr)
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3Com-3C510.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like to change my dynamic IP to static IP. Being new to NW I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how and where.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can not locate any document.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Appreciated if you can point me to the right direction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Myint
