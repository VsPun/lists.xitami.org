<PRE>XiFusion handles the redirect Nuke 5.6 uses, bug or not. Some what like
Apache, for some reason pure Xitami does not like it (non-conformant
redirects may very well be the issue) . Hence my life was easier...
I don't really think I needed to use it either but it eliminated a problem I
encountered quick and easily. That's what it is meant to do, and it did it.
I have Nuke setup on both Apache and Xitami, Apache works fine first shot,
Nuke on Xitami gave me some grief. Not a heck of a lot (due to some help)
but some.

Yes there are plenty of places to go for help regarding most Nuke issues...
for instance Nuke Forums is a good place to start.

My response was not meant as an AD for Xifusion ...
I was not aware giving credit where credit was due is an AD.
To some point I agree about advertisements but I'm sure the moderator would
have tapped them on their shoulder and let them know if he felt it was out
of hand. You have to remember some of the products are made for Xitami and
are free. I could see if the author was making $$, then by all means pay for
advertisement,
but these are utilities that authors wrote for convenience and are allowing
others to use them
free of charge.

But the answer to the question still is yes Nuke will work on Xitami.

&gt;<i> I once ran postnuke (a phpnuke descendant) with xitami 3.4d9 and php 4.0.5
</I>&gt;<i> without any problems. Don't understand why I should need XiFusion or
</I>&gt;<i> something. BTW, I think there is too much advertising for this and some
</I>&gt;<i> other products on this list (apart from Xitami of course).
</I>&gt;<i> There were indeed some problems, but they were all implementation-related
</I>&gt;<i> and could most often be found in the  various discussion boards and
</I>&gt;<i> buglist. Especially the redirection problem, which is a known bug (has
</I>been
&gt;<i> half a year ago, I wonder that it still is) which, as far as I recall,
</I>&gt;<i> stems from an incorrect use of the php redirect function, namely usage of
</I>&gt;<i> relative paths in the redirect which is not conformant with the HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> specification.
</I>&gt;<i> _Maybe_ Apache with compiled-in php _corrects_ this improper use. I don't
</I>know.
&gt;<i> But apart from that (looking at the code of nuke) I can't see any relation
</I>&gt;<i> to the actual webserver used.
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, in my opinion, there is no reason to think that any php product
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever depends on the webserver in use.
