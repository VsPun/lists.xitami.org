<PRE>Hello, let me introduce myself. I am a web designer
(strictly client-side) and I have recently downloaded the
Xitami package onto my Gateway 20000, which runs
under Windows 98.I know almost nothing about the
server-side aspect of things, but ya gotta start somewhere,
and nearly everything I know I have learned the hard
way, so.... here I go again!

The main reason I got Xitami was to give myself a home
workshop where I can begin learning the mysteries of
CGI, PHP,SQL...etc,etc.....(I don't plan to become a web host
any time in the near future!)

As far as I can tell, the installation was successful. I did the
PING thing on the DOS command line and it works dandy.
The Xitami icon appears in the tool bar just as it should,
and I can follow the various steps and get to the Admin
screen, etc. When Xitami is turned on, I am able to access
127.0.01 via IE6, otherwise... no go. I believe that's how it
should be, yes?

Naturally, I have 10,000 neophyte questions, but I shall limit
myself. At this point I'd like to accomplish one
concrete, significant goal. I would like to install an elementary
web document just for testing purposes, and log onto it from the
public library. Just to make it happen; to prove that it can be
done. That's all. Nothin' fancy.

Once I've got that down pat, I will feel that I've passed a meaningful
milestone, and can profitably turn my attention to whatever comes
next. Can anybody on this list steer me down the right road
with a few brief and crystal-clear directives (taking into account
my prior knowledge, which is close to zero.)?

I shall be thankful...
