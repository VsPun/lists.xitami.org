<PRE>&gt;<i>  &quot;GET /default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNN
</I>
I get thousands of these a week from all over the world. I'm not
crashing and other Xitami users here are handling it fine. It bloats
the log-files, that's all.

The over-sized request is a deliberate attempt to break into MS IIS
webserver. It is very specific to unpatched IIS and products based
on IIS; no other software can be be infected.

The over-sized request can confuse and crash some non-IIS software
that never expected over-sized requests. Several network printers
and some routers lock-up or die after one of these.

Unlike IIS, written by children, and printers with a web interface
that is only a frill, Xitami was written by adults who won't take
candy from strangers without examining it carefully and safely.
Request buffers are checked and don't overflow. And even if they
did, the code that Red/Nimda tries to inject would not run in Xitami
because it needs to hit a specific place in IIS's code.

&gt;<i>  this always seems to be the last entry in the log
</I>
At the height of these epidemics, over half of my logs were
Red/Nimda requests. On a low-traffic server, the odds are high that
the &quot;last log entry&quot; would be one of these.

Xitami sometimes has trouble rotating its logs, a problem that gets
worse when under heavy traffic as from these epidemics. Especially
on Windows which does get sluggish with thousands of files in one
folder. It seems to help to clear out any temporary or odd-name
files in the logs and temp folders.

Do you have a second machine that is networked, always on, and has
Perl? I have a little script to read a web page at intervals and
report if it isn't there (or does not have an expected phrase, to
distinguish the right response from error-messages). That would
narrow down the actual time of crash.
