<PRE>&gt;<i> Xitami to run on my Windows XP Home Edition ... somewhat confused as to which
</I>of the many versions that are listed on
<A HREF="http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm#download">http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm#download</A> I should download.

Don't go there. That page has been out of date for years. Go to:

<A HREF="http://www.xitami.com/download.htm">http://www.xitami.com/download.htm</A>

Do you want the stable old 2.4 series or the 2.5 series with new
features not fully debugged? If in doubt, go with 2.4, and
specifically 2.4d9

Win 95/NT bw3224d9.exe [705 Kb] works fine but has to be started
manually (or with trickery). For occasional testing, this is what I
use.

Win NT service bs3224d9.exe [740 Kb] can be told to auto-start, even
before you log-in. This is what I use for unattended full-time
servers.

The &quot;Vanilla Win95&quot; version will probably work, but the NT versions
will be more stable (XP is just NT with new decorations). The Alpha,
Unix, OS2 etc versions won't work on MS Windows. You don't sound
like you want the Source Kit, you want the Install Package.

2.5 adds some new frills, including (I think) a different
implementation of SSI. 2.4's SSI needs Perl installed, so it may be
better to use 2.5 if stability is not paramount. (FWIW, several
people here are running 2.5 perfectly well in heavy use.)
