<PRE>I have been Having Heaps of problems over the last week with DNS2GO.
I was doing a regular service scan on my domain  using
<A HREF="http://domainwhitepages.com/">http://domainwhitepages.com/</A>

Although the dns2go client was saying i had &quot;x&quot; IP  the service scan was
telling me i had &quot;y&quot; IP .
stopping and starting the dns2go client sometimes fixed it but not always.
I checked the dns2go site and there was a msg there saying they were having
problems.
seems to be fixed now .

Subject: [Xitami] Some can access some can't


&gt;<i> This is weird but probably a normal issue considering the
</I>circumstances....
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some people can access my server and some can't.. here's my settings:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using DNS2GO to manage my dynamic IP, so it assigns a regular web
</I>&gt;<i> address: <A HREF="http://surfto.27south.com.">http://surfto.27south.com.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> All is well with that. In my Xitami settings it states my Hostname is
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://default">http://default</A> and the IP addresses are 192.168.1.100 and 127.0.0.1. That
</I>&gt;<i> seems normal to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My log files are filled with people traveling through the site as normal,
</I>&gt;<i> but then I talk with people specifically who cannot access the site even
</I>&gt;<i> though the server is running and I am able to access it at the same time
</I>&gt;<i> they are not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a clue in here somewhere for me?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Rob
