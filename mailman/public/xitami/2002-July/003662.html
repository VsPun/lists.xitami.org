<PRE>&gt;<i> how to change their IP numbers. So they ask you to use DCHP, a
</I>&gt;<i> protocol that assigns IP numbers when you connect and can re-assign
</I>&gt;<i> if needed. (PoET is another variant of DCHP-like service, adapted
</I>&gt;<i> for spread networking.) Or to be honest: many ISPs deliberately
</I>&gt;<i> change IP numbers from time to time, just to make it hard for you to
</I>&gt;<i> run a busy server on a &quot;home&quot; account, so you will pay more for a
</I>&gt;<i> Business account.
</I>&gt;<i>

were'd you learn this from?

DHCP is designed to assign the same IP to the same adapter if the network
permits it. each NIC has a specific identifier code, somehow (and I have no
clue how) each NIC sniffs out the DHCP server, and talks to it. then, based
on the info the DHCP server is given, a IP is assigned. a good example is
me. I have an external DSL modem/router and use DHCP. using a standard
network switch DHCP assignes each NIC a public IP. they've only changed when
the network did. for example, up till last week, the NIC in my computer was
4.63.10.123, same as it was the day I got DSL and was using it to test the
connection (it was in a second PC, I was using a USB NIC) and when I
switched back, it recieved the exact same IP address, amazing

PoET isn't a protocol, it's a program for PPPoE which I'm not sure how it
works.

Dynamic DNS was already explained.
