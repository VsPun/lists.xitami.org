</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I am quite upset with the ongoing advertisements of this person on the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>admin of the list to ban him from the list.
</I>
All of my announcements are Xitami related.  I don't intend to advertise
ProtoNova on this list any more.  I just know that there are many users on
this list who are looking for alternative servers and I wanted to let
people know that I have an alternative server available.  I still intend on
helping people with problems with XiFusion and Xitami out and updating
XiFusion a few more times.

&gt;<i>I don't intend to do so, certainly not on the strength of a single
</I>&gt;<i>message.  Thomas has been very helpful to Xitami users on this list, and
</I>&gt;<i>with the expection of this one message all has other messages have been
</I>&gt;<i>about programs that work with Xitami, helping fill in the gaps between
</I>&gt;<i>what Xitami does and what users want to do (eg, use it with ColdFusion).
</I>
And sending e-mails, grabbing webpages, and otherwise simplifying life.
Life is difficult enough, why use tools that are difficult to understand
and use?

&gt;<i>Obviously if there were continuing advertisements for a competing
</I>&gt;<i>webserver then it would be a cause for concern.  However a single
</I>&gt;<i>announcement of a new program that might be of use to users of an existing
</I>&gt;<i>program that isn't being updated is well within accepted netiquette
</I>&gt;<i>(based on a dozen or so years on the 'net).  
</I>
No way was I even considering that.  I realized that I would be stretching
list rules when I posted that announcement last night.  Multiple posts
would be out of line even for me.

However, I do want people to know that nothing has changed in the XiFusion
arena and is still supported.  I know it is an extremely popular product,
and there is no reason to stop supporting it nor stop updating it.

&gt;<i>Thomas is right that Xitami really hasn't been maintained much (due to
</I>&gt;<i>lack of time) over the past few years -- IIRC the last minor update was
</I>&gt;<i>over a year ago, and the last major update was more than 2 years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>From time to time there are plans to change this, but a lack of free
</I>&gt;<i>time often gets in the way of such good plans.
</I>
I couldn't have said it better myself.  Time is something I think every
person here wishes they had more of...
