</I>
Another answer would be to set up some sort of handshaking in the HTTP
protocol (however, I don't see the IETF moving to change that very
quickly).  It isn't that difficult to add a level of security that would
make it much more difficult to crack.  ESMTP already does this with the
header in the first message from the server.  You then run an MD5 hash with
your password and the string sent in the first message and send it with the
EHLO command.  Much more secure than even DIGEST since a replay attack
requires cracking the username and password before a replay can occur.

However, I agree with the use of SSH tunnelling for remote admin.  Yet,
HTTP could offer a little more security than it does right now (which is
basically squat).
