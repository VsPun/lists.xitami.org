<PRE>I've just received the following strange e-mail, claiming that a message
of mine was deleted (by the recipient) without reading.  So I checked
back on the message of mine referenced therein, and found that it was
something I posted to this list exactly two months ago, on the 1st May.

Has anyone else been receiving similar strange &quot;notifications&quot;?  Can the
list owner confirm, or otherwise, that the purported sender of this mail
is a subscriber to the list?

Incidentally I don't, as a matter of routine, include a Return-Receipt-To
header in my mails, and am pretty sure that the list exploder doesn't
(because otherwise everyone would be being inundated with these sorts of
notifications all the time.

[All headers retained, for obvious reasons]

Hmm, exactly two months: could it be that Russell is so far behind on
collecting traffic from his ISP that the latter has deleted it?  (I know
that my ISP does something similar; if mail is neither delivered by SMTP
[for those of us that run our own smtpd] nor collected by POP3, then it
will be bounced back to the originator [as required by RFC-[2]821] after
30 days.  But surely this notification is insufficient to comply with
that sort of bounce mandated by the RFC?)

Forwarded message follows:
