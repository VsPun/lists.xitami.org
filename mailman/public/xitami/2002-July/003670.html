<PRE>&gt;<i> It seems that PHP/mySQL is quite the thing to learn these days.
</I>
And if it were simple enough to explain it all here, then everybody
would be an expert and it wouldn't be &quot;quite the thing&quot;.

And of course this mail-list is primarily for the webserver, not the
add-ins.

But here's the nutshell. Get PHP from the obvious place. Install it.
Read the documentation. As I recall, it is pretty clear about how to
hook it into a webserver. (Hint: in Xitami Admin, Filters, &quot;.PHP&quot; =
&quot;C:/PHP/PHP.EXE&quot; or something like that.)

I think PHP comes with sample pages.

Get PHP doing things first. In many ways, PHP is almost all you need
for many things. It has some database functionality built in.

But when you are sure you need an SQL-level database, get that,
install it, read the documentation.

Much info for PHP and mySQL is available on-line at the obvious
websites.
