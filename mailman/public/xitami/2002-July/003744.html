<PRE>&gt;<i> I am quite upset with the ongoing advertisements
</I>
I think it is fine with me.

If I were totally uninterested, it takes only a second to hit DEL
and move to the next message.

Although Thomas is hawking his product on another product's list,
Xitami never made money for iMatix so he is hardly stealing sales.
Ewen could still decide not to allow his list-serve pennies to be
used to distribute someone else's wares; I am glad Ewen has come out
in favor of reasonable mention of related products (even when that
product might replace Ewen's product).

And Thomas has been one of the most generous and genuinely helpful
people on this list, with deep experience in Xitami and other
webserver related issues.

Personally, I have decided that when Xitami no longer does what I
need, I'll just shift to Apache. Win-Apache is now considered
&quot;stable&quot;, or as stable as the underlying O/S; no more warnings.
However, I am about to take a good look at Thomas' product: he seems
like a good guy.

Oh, Thomas: why do you have a 650-pixel image next to a sidemenu? It
makes the page too big to read without horizontal scrolling.
