<PRE>Okay, so this is going to seem like a stupid question, but I have to ask
anyway...

I installed Xitami a few months ago to test CGI scripts locally on my
computer. At that time, I gave myself a username and password somehow that
work fine on my computer. Unfortunately, now that I've been using the
program for a while, I forgot what I did that worked. I've tried changing
the admin password as per the instructions in the FAQ, and that doesn't
work. I've tried creting a new user (writing the 2 files - also as per the
FAQ) and that doesn't work either. I can still use my own username and
password on my computer, but I'm trying to help my employer install Xitami
over the phone so he can view the CGI files I've made, and he can't get any
passwords to work. Any suggestions?
