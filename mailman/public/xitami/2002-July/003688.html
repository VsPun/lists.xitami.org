  Hello all,

  I am having problems getting my site listed in the major search engines.  
Even with free sites like Geocities, I was able to at least be listed in  
Google.  Is it because the search engines look at sites hosted on your own 
computer (with Xitami), differently than sites hosted in other ways?  Any 
help or advice would be appreciated!  I have gone to great lengths to 
compile meta tags, and title indexes.  I know of people who don't even use 
meta tags, or go to any effort to list their sites, yet they are listed way 
up in them, and it has just gotten frustrating to me.. Thank and I hope 
everyone is doing well!  have a good day.

  PS:  Would someone send (to my email address), the exact link that I need 
to use to come read, and post to this list online, without reading and 
posting through my email service?  I &quot;just&quot; now realized that I do not get 
many posts to my email, like other lists!  Only very few actually come 
there!  Thanks all!

   John - {dummy}
