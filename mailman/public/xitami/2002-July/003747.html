<PRE>Let's see if I can narrow the scope of my question - because I only have 
one, and this question is the sole reason I subscribed to this list.
I need to change my admin password. According to the FAQ, all I need to 
do is change the &quot;-&quot; after &quot;Admin=&quot; to the password I want to use in the 
file &quot;xitami.aut.&quot; I've done this, and it has no effect. I'm not trying 
to use Xitami as a web server - just using it to test CGI scripts 
locally. What can I do to fix this?
Incidentally, I understand that default passwords can cause security 
risks, but they're only a risk to people who don't remember to change 
them. If the program came with ANY password that worked, I wouldn't be 
bothering you with this question right now.

Thanks,
  - Greg
