<PRE>If you don't pay don't expect to see anything for at least 4-8 weeks. 
 There are so many sites going up each hour that they are back logged.

BTW: Wait 30-45 days before you re-submit.  Anything earlier will get 
you blacklisted as spammer.

</I>&gt;<i>  Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I am having problems getting my site listed in the major search 
</I>&gt;<i> engines.  Even with free sites like Geocities, I was able to at least 
</I>&gt;<i> be listed in  Google.  Is it because the search engines look at sites 
</I>&gt;<i> hosted on your own computer (with Xitami), differently than sites 
</I>&gt;<i> hosted in other ways?  Any help or advice would be appreciated!  I 
</I>&gt;<i> have gone to great lengths to compile meta tags, and title indexes.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> know of people who don't even use meta tags, or go to any effort to 
</I>&gt;<i> list their sites, yet they are listed way up in them, and it has just 
</I>&gt;<i> gotten frustrating to me.. Thank and I hope everyone is doing well!  
</I>&gt;<i> have a good day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  PS:  Would someone send (to my email address), the exact link that I 
</I>&gt;<i> need to use to come read, and post to this list online, without 
</I>&gt;<i> reading and posting through my email service?  I &quot;just&quot; now realized 
</I>&gt;<i> that I do not get many posts to my email, like other lists!  Only very 
</I>&gt;<i> few actually come there!  Thanks all!
