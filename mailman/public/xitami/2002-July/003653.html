<PRE>Vance,
didn't mean to be mean with my comment.
Over time it just got a feeling that a newbie might come to the conclusion 
that xifusion is a more or less manadatory prerequisite for sucesfully 
running any php-projekt together with xitami. And this is definitely not 
the case. In some cases it may be a quick and welcome  workaround to some 
problem, in general i think its rather a matter of misconception to wrap a 
coldfusion server around a php-engine.
Most of all, I believe that virtually no problem with a php-projekt has 
something to do with the webserver in use.
Kind regards,
tony

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I once ran postnuke (a phpnuke descendant) with xitami 3.4d9 and php 4.0.5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without any problems. Don't understand why I should need XiFusion or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something. BTW, I think there is too much advertising for this and some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other products on this list (apart from Xitami of course).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There were indeed some problems, but they were all implementation-related
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and could most often be found in the  various discussion boards and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buglist. Especially the redirection problem, which is a known bug (has
</I>&gt;<i>been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; half a year ago, I wonder that it still is) which, as far as I recall,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stems from an incorrect use of the php redirect function, namely usage of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relative paths in the redirect which is not conformant with the HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specification.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; _Maybe_ Apache with compiled-in php _corrects_ this improper use. I don't
</I>&gt;<i>know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But apart from that (looking at the code of nuke) I can't see any relation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the actual webserver used.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, in my opinion, there is no reason to think that any php product
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatsoever depends on the webserver in use.
