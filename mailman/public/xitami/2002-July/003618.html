&gt;&gt;<i>Clean-memory assertion failed - xitami.c (208)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is (strangely) located at the end of Xitami's execution in main().
</I>&gt;<i>I'm surprised the program got that far.  However, it is due to Xitami
</I>&gt;<i>attempting to use or access memory it doesn't own or no longer owns.
</I>
FWIW, no, what it means is that the memory usage tracking in the
library that Xitami uses (SFL) has detected that not all the memory
allocated has been freed up.  Typically this means that not all the
&quot;free my memory&quot; logic has been run, which often happens in a crash
situation.  This is primarily present in the code for the benefit of
developers, because if not all memory gets given back each time it is
taken, then eventually the program will take all the memory in the
system!  (It's enabled in the &quot;user&quot; versions as well to try to catch
those hard-to-find situations that occur only for real users.)

&gt;&gt;<i>Abnormal program termination
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It looks like the program exited but then the CPU took over and realized a
</I>&gt;<i>memory fault took place during the clean-memory scan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>core dumped
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hence, the core dump.  So much for avoiding it...
</I>
These two are actually _caused_ by the clean memory assertion failing;
the state of the program in that situation is saved to help in tracking
down where things might have gone astray.  This is mostly only of use to
developers though, who can match it up with their source code.
