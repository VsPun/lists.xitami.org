<PRE>Let me start off by saying I agree with your opinions, portability is a must
with my apps and I probably could have gone in and changed the script as
well, but... for alot of users editing a package like Nuke this is NOT an
option (as a matter of fact some users should not even have keyboards) and
they would not have a clue on how to follow the source to fix it (or even
follow instructions). I'm not a PHP person I prefer perl for CGI so yes I
could have fumbled through it (and I did a bit) and got sick of  looking
for, at the time, the unknown.
XiFusion is a viable quick and dirty soulution for me. However if this was
Nukes authors solution to the problem then it's a poor solution.
Personally I think they could have done a few things better with Nuke, for
instance do you think requiring setting php_display_errors=Off is any
better. To me that's another mask... (Ok I know I'm going further OT here)
So XiFusion masks a problem without having to go fix someones elses mess and
I think it does a good job at it too...

I like run-on sentences !

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> My opinion:
</I>&gt;<i> -) change the script: YES
</I>&gt;<i> -) modify xitamis source: NO WAY
</I>&gt;<i> -) use a wrapper: POOR SOLUTION, camouflages lost portability (and raises
</I>&gt;<i> lots of questions in messageboards)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;/snip&gt;
