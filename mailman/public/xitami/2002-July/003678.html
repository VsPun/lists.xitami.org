<PRE>Hi Thomas,

   THANX for replying... I took this off list as it's definitely
   Off-Topic...

   Actually what I had been looking for was a simple groupware application
   that has a DB backend.. and whiteboard functionality... to allow my now
   way too small a solutions design and support group a collabware
   solution that wasn't as heavyweight as the one Cisco typically supports
   and if we sign up they will design and support (in months) a version to
   our needs.. but then we loose control and it takes too long.. but for 5
   to 10 users and something that installed and ran in 5 minutes.. (except
   for the redirect issue..) the price tag though not free... seemed to be
   reasonable.. and that thing had way more than we would typically need..
   for simple schedule, project and case tracking... yet still was a
   really small footprint on a system...

   I have researched numerous freeware pieces.. to do the same thing.. but
   just don't have the time to glue it all together... so was opting for a
   bundled $70-80 a seat solution that wasn't completely optimum.. but on
   first glance seemed pretty simple to get running and configured in a
   hurry...

   Given my druthers ;&gt;) I would have enjoyed having a freeware or one
   time cost solution to reuse on a project/project basis, thus perhaps
   using VHOSTs to allow a Project based setup.. and thus also allow
   customer access to their project... ...and had thought of cobbling
   together a prepackaged freeware set from;

     Xitami - as the Web/(low usage) FTP server Server

     WhiteBoard/Chat - <A HREF="http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben/">http://hem.fyristorg.com/matben/</A>

     Backend DB/Info Portal - <A HREF="http://j.iis.free.fr/">http://j.iis.free.fr/</A>

     Simple Forum/listserv and/or Wiki addon.. - some Perl or PHP freeware
       from the multitudes available...

   If only I ever have some free time... ;&gt;)

   I had seen (many times ;&gt;) your Xifusion as an answer for resolving
   this issue with PHP (thus my comment in the original email ;&gt;) and
   Coldfusion, but wasn't aware it was totally generic in it's benefit..
   so I will give it a try...

   THANX for the help...

                                         Best Regards,
                                              Jim

Not sure why you want to pay $400+ for a product that looks horrible.  If
you want a piece of software like that but looks and runs better, I'll
develop it for Nuclear Vision (which is by far a cheaper, more versatile
product) and you won't have this problem and will end up spending less money.

However, if your company has made the unfortunate decision to purchase that
software, you can use XiFusion with Xitami to fix the problem.  Both
Nuclear Vision and XiFusion are products of Shining Light Productions.

Hope this helps!
