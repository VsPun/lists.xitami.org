<PRE>I was signed up for this list a few years ago and recall it being 
relatively active.  I'm still using an old version of Xitami for better 
or worse -- mostly better as far as I can tell.

I saw that a new version has been released and thought it would be a 
good time to re-subscribe to the list but it's been a couple of weeks 
and all I've received was the initial acknowledgment email telling me 
that I have successfully subscribed.

So my question is:  is the list dead or am I mis-configured somehow and 
just not receiving it?  I'm really interested in hearing what folks may 
have to say about version 5.  I'd love to be able to get it working 
under Ubuntu but I've never had any luck compiling the software for 
myself.  The system I do have working was pre-compiled and part of the 
basic installation under a-linux.

Thanks
       Mike
