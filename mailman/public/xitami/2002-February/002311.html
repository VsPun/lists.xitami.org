&gt;<i> &gt; Hello Control-Freak,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please make sure you are not sending out HTML-formatted emails,

Indeed; and this post of yours was correctly in that format.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, Outlook automatically responds to a html message with html.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think there is a way to change it, other than to change the format

</I>&gt;<i> replying to an html-formatted email, it is replying to an html
</I>
Amazed though I am to hear this, I've just looked at my partner's machine
(she uses Outlook 2000 as a mail client, fetching her mail from this OS/2
machine using POP3, and sending her outgoing mail to the SMTP server
hereon), and indeed I cannot find anything that deals with what to do in
that event.

Netscape has an option &quot;always send in plain ASCII, even when the
original is in HTML (or multipart/alternative)&quot;.  Whilst astounded by
MICROS~1 non-provision of an option to suppress HTML altogether, I am not
completely surprised.

All the same, it might be worth asking if there might be a setting after
all on the &lt;news:microsoft.public.outlook.configuration&gt; froup.

In the meantime, I'll try to remember to be less scathing of those using
Outlook [Express] (although, of course, one has to question the wisdom of
using a piece of software that has been demonstrated to commit over 200
violations of Internet standards (as enshrined in various RFCs).

&gt;<i> I checked the format of this response before I sent it, and according to
</I>&gt;<i> Outlook it is plain text before it left me.
</I>
Yep: it's fine.
