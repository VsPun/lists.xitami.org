<PRE>Go to ebay and make a search for: INTEL NETSTRUCTURE 1520 RACKMOUNT 1U
SERVER.  There is one of these server cache appliances there right now.

I like the idea of a proxy server or a cache server translating the dynamic
ASP content from Microsoft IIS.  Hey, sometimes you cant get around using
the Microsoft products!!!

Xitami is rock solid and no one has ever hacked into one of my Xitami
installations.  As for IIS.....I have trouble keeping it running for more
than a month.  If your business is using Microsoft databases then the
ASP+IIS is a very convinient application server.  The problem is keeping it
running and secure.

That is why I am asking.

I have always known proxy servers to be the definition you give below.  I
knew them to manage user access out to the Internet, but not Internet
browser access to your web pages.

I found it curious that you used a cache server and a proxy server
interchangably as if they were the same thing.

I take it a cache appliance can serve dynamic pages, since by definition
dynamic content cant be stored and re-served without a new query taking
place.

Q:Intel Cache Appliance racks on ebay go for about $300.00 nowadays.

Response: I didn't know that Intel made internet Caches. Could you send
me a link offline? Thanks

Q: &quot;Is a cache appliance the same thing as a proxy server???&quot;

A: As the name would suggest they are both different functions which are
often combined into the same device.
Internet Cache, Cache Appliance, Squid basically refer to a box which
sits at a connection before the internet.   If the WebPages are used
often the computer stores it on the hard drive, next time someone makes
a request to the internet it will check the box to see if a cached
version is there.   If it is, it saves time for the user and bandwidth
for the business &amp; Isp. Which contrary to belief is not free.

 A Proxy Server is essentially a gateway in which can perform specified
network functions. Most of the time when people refer to a proxy they
either want to a)use NAT Network Address Translation b)Restrict what
websites you can access or c)restrict or control bandwidth. (How much a
particular IP can download etc.)

If you are a whiz at linux you could make a little box do your e-mail,
web server, nat and caching  very inexpensively.

Q:&quot;Do they all have the capability of serving ASP (or other dynamic
pages) that are sitting behind them?&quot;

A:  If you wish to know how a device would &quot;serve&quot; ASP pages then it
would also depend on the &quot;web server&quot; software that you choose.

I think its neat. Squid is great! Saves you buying a cache rack for a
couple of grand.
