<PRE> Yeah it was I guess.  I got a chance to mess with it last night.  I decided
to completely uninstall xitami.  I reinstalled it and had new problems.  It
wouldn't run.  I would start the server and after a few seconds it would
stop.  I think I had probably &quot;ran&quot; 2 different exe files, as in one for win
2000, and one for win95 or something like that.  Which caused some really
weird things with the server console.

 It runs fine now.  Thanks list.

Have you got the old version running as a service or whatnot?
