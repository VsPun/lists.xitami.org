<PRE>Q:Intel Cache Appliance racks on ebay go for about $300.00 nowadays.

Response: I didn't know that Intel made internet Caches. Could you send
me a link offline? Thanks

Q: &quot;Is a cache appliance the same thing as a proxy server???&quot;

A: As the name would suggest they are both different functions which are
often combined into the same device.
Internet Cache, Cache Appliance, Squid basically refer to a box which
sits at a connection before the internet.   If the WebPages are used
often the computer stores it on the hard drive, next time someone makes
a request to the internet it will check the box to see if a cached
version is there.   If it is, it saves time for the user and bandwidth
for the business &amp; Isp. Which contrary to belief is not free. 

 A Proxy Server is essentially a gateway in which can perform specified
network functions. Most of the time when people refer to a proxy they
either want to a)use NAT Network Address Translation b)Restrict what
websites you can access or c)restrict or control bandwidth. (How much a
particular IP can download etc.)

If you are a whiz at linux you could make a little box do your e-mail,
web server, nat and caching  very inexpensively.

Q:&quot;Do they all have the capability of serving ASP (or other dynamic
pages) that are sitting behind them?&quot;

A:  If you wish to know how a device would &quot;serve&quot; ASP pages then it
would also depend on the &quot;web server&quot; software that you choose.

I think its neat. Squid is great! Saves you buying a cache rack for a
couple of grand.
