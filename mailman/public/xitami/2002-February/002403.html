<PRE>This is off subject, but I reported the spam to the provider of the IP
address that the &quot;click here&quot; pointed to, and apparently the server has
been closed down just since this morning. 

I am working on a set of pages that show how to report spam to the
managing provider of the place the spam actually originated from. The
pages will also cover how to report to the provider if the spam came
through an open SMTP server or through a mailing list like this one did.
I have had very good results using this method.

The pages are still under development and probably won't be complete for
another couple of weeks, but some of the data is available now if anyone
is interested.
