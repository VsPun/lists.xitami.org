<PRE>About this whole Linux superiority complex:

1.) The internet is a visual medium, like it or not.  Most of these over
zealous Linux fans brush the reality of this off by saying that you can
create web pages with a simple text editor.  However true that may be, that
assumes that your web graphics are already made, and only need to be called
up.

Until you can run the full suite of Adobe products on Linux, then Linux is
useless as a web graphics platform.  No text editor replaces Adobe Photoshop
or Illustrator.  And if your answer to web graphics is colored text and font
manipulation........well, you just don't get what the Internet is doing.

The ideal environment for graphics is an Apple (considering that Silicon
Graphics machines are out of the reach of everyone who is not Lucasfilm and
Pixar).  Considering that Apple does not even have a server, much less a
database server or web server, they are quickly becoming uncomfortably
unconnected to the new breed of web designers.

This leaves Windows (Winblows to you Linux zealots) as a very attractive
option.  You don't need to know three operating systems, and you can even
stretch your machine to host both a Xitami server and have that same machine
create the graphics, create the web page, manage the web page.....and even
host a database.  Crazy, but if budget is an issue, you cant beat having a
minimum of software titles and a minimum of operating systems to learn and
deploy.

2.) I wont even get into the sound editing issue, since Linux does not even
exist in that field.  However, I will point out that sound IS PART OF the
multimedia realm.

3.) I guess you could pay a graphic designer $90.00 per hour if you want
your web pages to have more than just colored text and pasty
backgrounds........but, hey, that would defeat the whole &quot;self-sufficiency&quot;
of the Linux religion.

4.) Reading nasty messages is definitely much more distracting than simply
erasing a post that was sent using HTML mail.

So lay off the newbies....or simply go create the user group that someone
suggested below.  In order to keep the email list name shorter I suggest you
simply call it LINUX.  Everyone understands this term to be the synonym for
ONE DIMENSIONAL anyways.

P.S. --- Hey look ma!! I wrote this without using HTML!!!


YOU WROTE:



If those guys really have that much of a problem with it, then they should
go start their own list and call it
<A HREF="mailto:PlainTextXitamiLinuxFanaticism@yahoogroups.com">PlainTextXitamiLinuxFanaticism@yahoogroups.com</A> .  Its free, and it can be
setup to work just like this.  We'll stay here and direct the newcomer Plain
Text 'enthusiasts' over there.

Don't sweat the small stuff in life.
