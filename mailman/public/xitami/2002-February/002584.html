There is a Xitami bug about case sensitivity and aliases which I have 
found. This could be related perhaps? The problem I have found is that 
if your OS is filename case sensitive (e.g. Linux) then you are hosed 
because the alias detection code goes and lowercases the path and the 
alias to check for a match.

I don't used PHP so I can't say whats wrong there but I will say that 
the Xitami alias matching code is perhaps not the best written part of 
Xitami. If you downlaod the source code then perhaps you can figure out 
what the difference is.
