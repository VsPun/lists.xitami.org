<PRE>The last time the Xitami authors answered this question they said that they
had no intentions of reverse engineering to accomodate Microsoft's
propriatary work.

I think you can use the &quot;Publish&quot; feature of Front Page to put up the web
site and the subsequent versions.  This is no different than uploading
through an FTP connection, like Macromedia Dreamweaver uses to publish.

What you wont be able to do is manage the live site.  You wont be able to
log on with Front Page and browse the live folders in a Xitami web site, and
use Front Page's many management features.

You also wont be able to apply their &quot;Themes&quot;, which make a lot of the
tedious formating work go away.  If you know CSS then this is not a problem.

This is actually a blessing in disguise: Macromedia has the right approach:
You should never fiddle with the live site.  You should only update the
latest version after testing the changes locally.

Also, Cascading Style Sheets make your site easier to manage than Front Page
extensions.  As long as you know CSS and HTML well enough, you are better
off than using Front Page's formating features.

YOU SAID:


I few years back I bought a Linux distribution which had the option of
loading FrontPage Extensions on it. Since Linux runs on so many Internet
servers perhaps giving that portion away for free was a way that
Microsoft could get into the market?

If it was not just for MS how could one load FP extensions for Xitami?

Thanks
