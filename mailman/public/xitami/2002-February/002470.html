Well, its really not the language that bothers me, its the attitude.  Its
just friggin text - whether its HTML or plain text.  I admit some take it
too far by adding backgrounds and graphics, but it is generally not the case
here.  I really don't understand the big deal about it.  A deleted HTML
message takes up no more space than a deleted Plain Text message.

And the whole Linux Supremacy bit is very irritating as well.  I would
prefer a religious freak any day.  At least religious fanatics think the
rest of the world is just lost.  Linux thumpers believe the rest of the
world are just lowly idiots that are nothing more than herded cattle being
led to slaughter.

Xitami is a web server that works on both Linux and Windows OSes, so like it
or not, there are gonna be quite a few Windows users on this list.  And even
though it isn't necessarily a good thing, Windows is still the most
popular/common OS on the planet.  And most of these Windows users who are
starting a Xitami-based web server for the first time, and are requesting
assistance, have not yet encountered the likes of a Linux thumper.  They
probably didn't even know that Outlook defaults to HTML messages.  And, they
surely had no idea that it was gonna piss someone off to no end if they did
unknowingly post in HTML.  Face it, HTML is gonna keep coming . . . .

If those guys really have that much of a problem with it, then they should
go start their own list and call it
<A HREF="mailto:PlainTextXitamiLinuxFanaticism@yahoogroups.com">PlainTextXitamiLinuxFanaticism@yahoogroups.com</A> .  Its free, and it can be
setup to work just like this.  We'll stay here and direct the newcomer Plain
Text 'enthusiasts' over there.

Don't sweat the small stuff in life.
