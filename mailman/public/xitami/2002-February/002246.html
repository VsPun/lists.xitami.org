Subject: [Xitami] Two domain names.

Hello to everyone.

I have had Xitami 2.5b5 running for over a year now and first I must say it
has been a joy to use. Actually all I had to do was install it, made some
html and after that, just forget about it. No need to check every day if my
pages were alive. They truly have been. Including FTP.

I have to agree.  I have, been running Xitami Powered for over 4 years, on a
M$ Operating to say the least! ;-0   I have found over the final OS switch
to a flavor of UNIX, LINUX, xBSD.

I have ADSL connection with static IP. So my
both domains point to same IP-address. Is it possible to make Xitami to
separate these domain names and guide the visitors to sites (in this case
two different folders on same HD) they are looking for or do I have to set
up a DNS-server or something else? I've tried to use virtual hosts but I
just 

Ok here is how I do it and it works, and one thing I have to say before I
tell you is that, it is here at the Xitami Support Forum from great people I
have learned to achieve this.  Another STRONG feature from Imatix! 
-----remember this is just one way to set it up, there are many solutions
and alternatives, I am just telling you the way I have it setup and it works
 

1st:  You have the DSL connection and the Static IP, (The best start you
could ask for), even if you had a block of addresses, it is still better to
bind &amp; multi-home all your Virtual Hosts to one IP, I mean the IP system as
Area codes and phone numbers are running their course.

2nd-Solution-A: Set up a box with FreeBSD (again, there are many available
solutions, I do not want to start a OS war here).  This will be for your
name server.  You will also need 2 more IP's Static for the Name Server. 
Just ask your uplink to provide you with some.  There is rarely a cost
associated with getting more IP's, you just need a valid reason for usage, a
name server is a very valid reason.
!!-This is the most effective solution-!!

2nd-Solution-B:  Have someone do your name server (DNS).  Point of the
matter is, the more control you have of your OWN name server the better. 
There are people that will do it for you, the question is, are they
available to update a name server when ever YOU want, and then at what cost?
If you are interested in this solution, we www.thecomputerdojo.com can
provide this service for you for 9.99 per month.  It is cheaper than buying
another machine and dealing with your uplink trying to get IP's, (some
uplinks charge for extra IP's).

3rd:  Setup a box for Xitami using whatever operating system.  I myself
still run my Xitami Web Server on the M$ Platform.  I am sure some people
will think this is a mistake and would suggest running under some flavor of
UNIX/LINUX.
Bind this machine to the static IP you choose.

4th:  Setup name server with A-Name and C-name, you can do MX resolutions
too, Deerfield 
has a great Mail Daemon   www.mdaemon.com

5th: Now that you have all that setup, the easy part is dealing with Vhosts.
 Here is how you do it.  Go into Xitami Setup, click on Virtual Hosts, click
on NEW:


Create virtual host profile:   .cfg extension is assumed 
stick to the actual domain name, for example: cybercoalition

Overwrite existing?   
ALWAYS!



Select IP address:   All addresses (recommended)209.5.45.142127.0.0.1 
do not change

Or, enter DNS host name:   
here you would put  www.cybercoalition.com




Web page root directory:  
Here you put the path eg: webpages/cybercoalition 
CGI-bin directory:  
best to make separate cgi-bin directories eg:
webpages/cybercoalition/cgi-bin

FTP root directory:  
I use WAR_FTP, was not happy with Xitami's FTP server for what I run.  For a
stand alone webserver FTP it's alright.

Create directories if necessary?  
Absolutely

Superuser password:  
anything you want

Uses shared logfiles?  
Up to you, I make separate, do not want everyone sharing log files.

Can use Browser-Based Admin?  
again, up to you.....

If so, user id:  
anything

and password:  
anything


Now restart the server and exit....




So, in short. Two domain names pointing to same IP and in Xitami I have two
different folders for two different domains. How can I make this work?


see above......  ;-)

Hope this helps you out....

Best regards

Hogan
