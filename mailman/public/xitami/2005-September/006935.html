<PRE>
your hostnames in system hosts file (located in 
\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\) to recognise hosts by the operating
system?
for example:
127.0.0.1      localhost john.locahost jack.localhost


In all windows versions for localhost on lan base domain names use the 
&quot;hosts&quot; file. The hosts file is the lookup table that each windows pc 
uses befor it querries a dns server. Note that you might want to use the

ip address of your network card and not the loopback ip of 127.0.0.1 and

copy the setting to the hosts files of the other pc's on your lan. So 
the can view the pages you are serving. This is all so needed if you are

running an e-mail server over a lan.
sample of hosts file
127.0.0.1  localhost
127.0.0.1  mycomputername
127.0.0.1  john.mycomputername



Hi Jeff - Hi Andris

Thank you for your help. Tried both your suggestions.

C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts already had one line in it:

127.0.0.1	localhost

but both mycomputername and localhost were accessible via browser.

Tried 
all possible combinations/versions, 
changing Xitami config every time, 
restarting both computer/Xitami every time, 
clearing browser-cache every time,
requesting everything from browser every time.

The entire test took about 2 hours.

Browser did not behave per new information in the hosts file but still
could access mycomputername and localhost everytime.

Used IP 127.0.0.1 and left localhost in primary position.

Tried and added :
- subdomain.localhost
- subdomain.mycomputername
- subdomain  all by itself without any dots

In both forms:
- all host names accross IP separated by spaces on same line
- host name accross IP, each on an individual line

All of them seem to be ignored during browser request.

Almost as if XP takes no notice of the hosts file. 

Could there be some other entry on some other XP file that needs to be
carried out? Or could two hosts files be located in different places on
the system?

I appreciate your help.

Ayhan
