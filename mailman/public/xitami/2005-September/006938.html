<PRE>Hi Martin,

My file extensions and hidden + system files are all visible.

It is the first time I see the contents of the drivers/etc folder.

I opened and examined each file in amazement and wonder, and saw they
look like Xitami config files.

I tried to enter the new host names also into the networks file, because
it had the IP No.s accross the names. I wanted to see if the computer
would respond. It didn't. So I changed everything back to its original
state. 

The imhosts.sam looked like a complicated format. I decided not to
interfere with it.

I tried many many different names in the hosts file.  Nothing worked. 

I remvoed the localhost entry - localhost was still accessible. I put it
back in.

I tried everything back at work next day on XP Professional. No problem
at all - hosts file absolutely functional. 

There is something wrong with the laptop's XP Home configuration. It
does not respond to changes in the hosts file. There can be two reasons:

a) It is reading the hosts from somewhere else or
b) it is somehow configured to try the dialup first.

The laptop is new and the XP Home was pre-installed together with Norton
Internet Security. I had to turn its firewall off because I could not
get it to peek out and register+live-update itself. It responded to no
kind of &quot;allow&quot; instruction. The XP firewall is enabled in its place
right now.

&quot;I do not have any users on the laptop yet.&quot;
I am just beginning to move my things in. Users or passwords wait until
after everything is installed and working.

I don't want to take up much more of the Xitami group's time and
attention with a problem which is evidently Windows-related.

It would be a big help if you could point me to some basic 
XP admin and account management 
reference or discussion group for non-sysadmins. 

I did try the MSDN but I could not find information because I do not
know what exactly I should be looking for.

Anyway - thanks for all trouble.

Ayhan

Are you sure you edit the file &quot;hosts&quot; and not &quot;hosts.sam&quot;?
Must always be a single line for each entry.
Maybe when Windows sees the keywords &quot;localhost&quot; or &quot;mycomputername&quot; it
does not look into the hosts file at all. 
You can try to put entries into hosts when you use a name different from
your computer's name:
127.0.0.1  anothername
127.0.0.1  sub.anothername
127.0.0.1  more.anothername

&gt;<i>Browser did not behave per new information in the hosts file but still
</I>&gt;<i>could access mycomputername and localhost everytime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Used IP 127.0.0.1 and left localhost in primary position.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Tried and added :
</I>&gt;<i>- subdomain.localhost
</I>&gt;<i>- subdomain.mycomputername
</I>&gt;<i>- subdomain  all by itself without any dots
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In both forms:
</I>&gt;<i>- all host names accross IP separated by spaces on same line
</I>&gt;<i>- host name accross IP, each on an individual line
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>All of them seem to be ignored during browser request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Almost as if XP takes no notice of the hosts file. 
</I>&gt;<i>
