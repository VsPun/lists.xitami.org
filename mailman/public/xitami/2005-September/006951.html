  the wireless router mentioned above, is actually a brand new replacement
for an older (linksys befsr41 ver.2 &quot;wired&quot;) router which was previously
assumed to be the cause of this issue. the new unit however, did not correct
the problem, and i'm now left holding 2 fully functional routers which both
produce the exact same results. i'm hoping i'll still be able to use the
older unit as a switch at some point, as i've already exceeded my time-frame
allowance for returning the new one. the only really good thing that came
out of the purchase, was an error made by the retailer... and as it turns
out, the new router only cost me about $35 canadian (after rebates). that,
in my opinion, was a very cheap price to pay for a brand-name wireless-g
upgrade.
 my decision to purchase a new router, came after replacing all my cables,
switching rooms, running all the usual security scans, rolling back software
versions, and 2 visits from an isp tech. replacing the router seemed to be
the last logical step at that point.
 the problem first began on the evening of july 26 while a scene from a new
tom selleck movie was being shot on my front lawn. interference from the
film crew's equipment, is what was first assumed by my isp to be the
problem... but it continued right through the entire month of august, long
after the crew had packed up and moved on.
 the problem did however, seem to stop immediately on september 1, right
after disabling the wireless function and updating all nic-card drivers
across the entire lan (a coincidence perhaps)... but decided to return
again, about 4 days ago. just like before, this problem is most likely to
get out of hand in the evenings, weekends, and late at night when the
offices at my isp are closed, and nobody's available to observe what's going
on. my requests for a replacement (isp provided) modem have gone ignored as
well, as they've already given a clean bill of health to the one i currently
have, twice (comtrend 9186).
 pppoe and &quot;keep alive&quot; settings on the router seem to all check out when
the isp's help desk walks me through. they are the same settings i've been
using for the past 4 years.
 i do apologise once again for bringing this into the &quot;xitami&quot; forum, but
from where i sit, i clearly see the relationship between the two... as my
server is unable to perform well as a result.
 thank you kindly for your comments magnus... should anything else on this
topic cross your mind, i'd be very pleased to hear from you. as the old geek
saying goes, &quot;i'm about ready to chuck this thing out the window&quot; :)
