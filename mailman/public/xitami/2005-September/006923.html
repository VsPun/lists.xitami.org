<PRE>Hello Jim,

&gt;<i> Hi Folks:
</I>
&gt;<i> I am trying to access the default dirrectory on my server at:
</I>&gt;<i> ftp.compuconference.com
</I>
&gt;<i> If I access the server from home using either an FTP client such as
</I>&gt;<i> FileZilla or even Internet Explorer, I am having no problem at all.
</I>&gt;<i> However, It doesn't seem to work anywhere else. I am reaching the
</I>&gt;<i> server but cannot obtain a dirrectory listing.
</I>
&gt;<i> Any help would be appreciated all over the place.
</I>
I've been following this discussion and decided to see if I could get
in with FileZilla. I had no problem at all and I would like to thank
you for the copy of &quot;The Complete Idiots Guide to HTML&quot;. Not that I
need it as I have the book version. I copied the log of the session
and have attached it hereto.

I hope this helps.

Best regards,
 Magus
