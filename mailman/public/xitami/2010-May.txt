Hi!

Please can anyone tell me what is the status (legal regarding usage and 
distribution and technical regarding support) of the previous versions 
(v.2.5x)?
Also, to whom I might write to ask for a permission to distribute modified 
installation package of version 2.5x?

Thank you!

Best regards,

Hi Faik,

Legal status is the source code is (c) iMatix and unsupported.

You don't need permission to distributed modified packages, just make
sure you publish the source code of any files that are licensed under
the GPL or another open source license.

Contact me directly if you need more details: ph at imatix.com.
