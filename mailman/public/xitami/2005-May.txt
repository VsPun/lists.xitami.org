  At a glance, mine is surely not the dumbest question ever asked here, so 
i'm going to try this again since I've fought with it for this darn long 
now!

  It has got to be something I'm doing 'or not doing' here, because I know 
there is 'a way' to make an "include" work on my server, either with or 
without ssi..  Testing as free script that uses a template.html page with " 
<!--content--> " as it's only place-holder for the index.cgi page of the 
script, I have tried it both inside and outside of the cgi-bin, and with 
every possible cfg and place-holder I can think of, but I still cannot 
"include" the file!  Someone "please" steer me in the right direction here 
to make this work!  Anything that anyone can tell me to try, to include a 
file in another, I will certainly give it a shot!  Thanks ANYONE!    harthon

I am sending a file from an MVS system to a Windows system with Xitami
configured on it

The problem is that when it is sent in ascii mode an additional end of line
character gets embedded at the end at the receiving server

i have attached the formats below

The format for the input file  is as for : UCC_0032.WS

The format for the  file (AT CLIENT SERVER WITH XITAMI)  is as for :
UCC_0042.WS when sent in ascii mode

When sent in binary mode
The format for the  file (AT CLIENT SERVER WITH XITAMI)   is as for :
UCC_0041.WS  ( which is unreadable)

I tried sending it by ftp to another server where IIS was set up , there was
no problem  the formats at this server . the input and the output files had
the same format when opened in notepad.


Can you help me overcome this problem of an additional eof character being
embedded at the client server.
Any help would be appreciated

Regards,
Joel

I do know that for includes to work such as:  <!--#include virtual=3D"site=
foot.txt"--> it is going to 
look for the file you are including in the main web page directory of your=
 server (i.e. 
/webpages) and it will not show if you place the file within a subdirector=
y of /webpages where 
you may have your template.html file.

If you want to include a .txt file within a scipt what I use is:

sub include {
# --------------------------------------------------------
# This is text to include. Use like an SSI.

my $file =3D shift;
open (FILE, "<$file") or die "Can't open $file ($!)";
print <FILE>;
close FILE;
}
## Then add this line wherever you want file included:

 |; 
&include ("dbside.txt");
print qq|

I use this for many scripts to include a footer and side menu within my di=
splays.   Especially 
for hosts sites which don't always allow SSI.

Hope this help :)

  Thanks Ron, "AND Lois"

  I have about decided that I am also having problems with the cgi script 
itself, for the following reasons, unless someone here might recognize 
something else I should do.
  I CAN make the opening page "template file" include the index.cgi file 
which allows me to set that page up using html etc;  HOWEVER, the script 
automatically builds additional pages as you go, (it's like a blog or bb 
script), as well as it auto-prints page numbers "on the fly"  ie: [Page: 
1.2.3...] into that page, BUT that first page is the ONLY page that seems to 
be using the <include>!!  IOWs when you click one of the additional page #s, 
you are sent directly to the index.cgi instead of everything remaining 
inside of the template page....  hope @ makes sense!!   So although I AM 
able to link to the template.shtml page where it is working correctly, and 
the index.cgi is included into the html design etc; once you click to go to 
another page of the script, all of this is gone!   Sorry so long and 
confusing, but I really do appreciate all of your help and consideration.  
Have a good day!  harthon

  Thanks Ron, "AND Lois"

  I have about decided that I am also having problems with the cgi script=
=20
itself, for the following reasons, unless someone here might recognize=20
something else I should do.
  I CAN make the opening page "template file" include the index.cgi file=20
which allows me to set that page up using html etc;  HOWEVER, the script=20
automatically builds additional pages as you go, (it's like a blog or bb=20
script), as well as it auto-prints page numbers "on the fly"  ie: [Page:=20
1.2.3...] into that page, BUT that first page is the ONLY page that seems t=
o=20
be using the <include>!!  IOWs when you click one of the additional page #s=
,=20
you are sent directly to the index.cgi instead of everything remaining=20
inside of the template page....  hope @ makes sense!!   So although I AM=20
able to link to the template.shtml page where it is working correctly, and=
=20
the index.cgi is included into the html design etc; once you click to go to=
=20
another page of the script, all of this is gone!   Sorry so long and=20
confusing, but I really do appreciate all of your help and consideration. =
=20
Have a good day!  harthon

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I think you should look within the script you are using and see if
there is a place where it is including a header or footer for the
pages other than the first page - which uses your template.   Or where
you can create a space to include what you are trying to include and
then use the 'sub include' I offered in my previous post to call it
within the script itself rather than just in the template.   I've done
this with other scripts.

  Thanks Lois!  You hit the problem "dead on the money"!  Of course I would 
have never found it or figured it out on my own, I see now that you are 
exactly right about what is going on!  The problem is howeveri, I'm not sure 
that I will be able to fix it..  Since I renamed the "template.html" file 
that came with the script, and replaced it with cpsa.shtml, does this mean 
that I will now have to change every instance of "template.html" to 
"cpsa.shtml" within the script??  I sure hate being this close to making 
this thing work and not have the ability to make this final adjustment, but 
I hate bothering you or anyone else with my prob also..  Is there a simple 
method, or is there any kind of work-around so that I might be able to make 
the appropriate changes to this script without messing it all up?  Again I'm 
really sorry to bother anyone with this, but I aprreciate it a lot, and it's 
quite obvious to me that you know/knew exactly what's going on with it!  
Thanks a ton and have a good day all!   harthon

Tom:

Yes, since you renamed the "template.html" file
that came with the script, and replaced it with cpsa.shtml, you should
do a search and replace and change any instance of "template.html" to
"cpsa.shtml" within the script.

Make a backup copy of your script just in case something goes wrong :)

I'm a little late here..

A signed short int boundary got hit in this case. Decreasing the size by 
one octet/byte took the sign bit out of play.

Subject: [Xitami] running cgi on xitami problem
Message-ID: <427BDBF6.27820.7A27CD@localhost>

Hello All,

as I wanted to run the small utility provided by Marc here on the list I ran into some 
problems. Some are solved with the help of Marc, but one thing I am still wondering 
about and would like to get some input from the list.
What I found so far is that cgi is not running proper, if ever, on xitami 2.5c2. Too bad, 
had to switch the whole server to 2.4d11.
My problem which is left:
I can't get cgi running if xitami is started as a service with xisrv32 even when the user 
who starts the service is in the same user group as the user who starts the xigui32. 
Starting xitami with xigui32, cgi is running proper. Does anyone has any ideas why ?

I like to run xitami as a service while I don't have to log onto the machine 
( power outage...power back on = xitami back on).
Has anyone running xitami as a service with xigui32 and srvany ? Haven't tried it yet.

Johannes

I don't have any problem running gap.
My system is win 2k, running v2.4d9
and win 98 running v2.4d6

For those interested in solving the problem, here is the source code of the 
gap utility:
(PBCC, looks like visual basic without GUI)

Most problems with running cgi applications were caused by incorrect home 
directory (assuming a running directory), but this is not the case here, 
there is no file access.


DEFINT a-z
FUNCTION PBMAIN()
     OPEN ENVIRON$("CGI_STDOUT") FOR OUTPUT AS #3
     a$ = ENVIRON$("QUERY_STRING")
     l = INSTR(a$, "://")
     IF l THEN
         a$ = MID$(a$, l + 3)
     END IF
     ip$ = EXTRACT$(a$, ":")
     qs$ = "/" + REMAIN$(a$, "/")
     ip$ = EXTRACT$(ip$, "/")
     po = VAL(REMAIN$(a$, ":"))
     IF po = 0 THEN
         po = 80
     END IF
     PRINT #3, "<html><body>Connecting to <strong><font color=blue>" ip$ 
"</font></strong> port <font color=red><strong>";:
     PRINT #3, po "</strong></font> query <font color=green><strong>" qs$

     IF ERR THEN

         EXIT FUNCTION
     END IF
     TCP PRINT #2, "GET " + qs$ + " HTTP/1.0
     TCP PRINT #2, "Host: " + ip$
     TCP PRINT #2, "Connection: close"

         INCR l
         IF TRIM$(a$) = "" THEN
             EXIT LOOP
         END IF

     PRINT #3, "</strong><xmp>
     WHILE NOT ERR
         TCP LINE #2, a$: PRINT #3, a$

Subject: [Xitami] [Alias] and [Filter] do conflict?
Message-ID: <428227C9.91B24A54@libero.it>

Hi,

my build of xitami 2.5c2 on OS/2 works well but I've found something which I
think is a problem with xitami itself and not with the build.

I have this defaults.cfg

--------8<---------------------
#*END

[Alias]
   /schede = "w:\\wiki"


[Cgi]
    workdir=-
    Form-query = "1"
    debug=1

[Filter]
    .php = "e:/internet/php/cgi/php.exe"
    .prg = "./cgi-bin/hscript.exe"

[Server]
    Cache-defaults = "0"
    Webpages = "w:/web"
    temp-dir = "./temp/"
    debug=1
-------------------------------

Look that I have an [Alias] and a [Filter] section for .php files.

Now, when a request arrives for a .php file which resides in an aliased dir it
does not get "translated" as if it where a simple .html file.

Look at this debug log:

It's a problem in Xitami, yes.  I think it's running the filter but in the 
wrong place, or it's passing bad arguments to the filter.

I don't have time to debug this but if someone can trace the problem in the 
code - especially the difference in behaviour between a working filter and a 
non-working filter, I'll release a patch.

OK.  It's smthttp.c, and smthttpl.c.  smthttp.c is built using Libero and has 
an animation ability (you need Libero installed):

 - lr -animate smthttp.l
 - rebuild

This shows what the HTTP agent in the server does when the request comes in.  
You can test with a local (working) filtered file and an aliased (failing) 
filtered file.  If there's a difference in the animation trace, that makes 
the problem easy to find.

Next, smthttpl.c does most of the hard work of handling a HTTP request.  There 
are two or three main functions that check the type of file, resolve aliases, 
etc.  You'd have to start with the code in smthttp.c and follow it as it 
calls these functions (you can see which ones, they are printing the debug 
statements you reported in your email).

Pieter,

after further testings I've found out that xitami calls the php interpreter
passing to it the correct script file name (that is, the correct full path from
volume name to script name - w:\wiki\pmwiki.php in my case).

But, php.exe does not use it's arguments to find the script but some environment
variable (like PATH_TRANSLATED and/or - I'm still investigating - SCRIPT_FILENAME)
and, for sure, PATH_TRANSLATED does not point to the right path (relative to
yesterday defaults.cfg) but to a subdir of webpages configuration.

I mean, path_translated becomes w:\web\schede\wiki\pmwiki.php and not
w:\wiki\pmwiki.php.

So, the problem seems not to be in the code that spawns the .php interpreter but
in the code that creates the cgi environment before spawning the cgi executable.

Does this help you in any way?

Maurilio.

Yes, this makes sense.  I vaguely remember this being reported as a problem in 
the past.

I've taken a look.  I don't have time to set-up a test environment so this is 
speculative, but the problem appears to be in smthttpl.c where it formats the 
path_translated variable, wrongly sticking the rootdir before the path name.  
Try this patch (smthttpl.c, line 2656):

    if (filter)
        path_translated = xstrcpy (NULL, p_http-> url, NULL);
    else
        path_translated = xstrcpy (NULL, full_rootdir, p_http-> path_info, 
NULL);

No guarantee this works but if it does I'll patch the source code.

Regards,
Pieter Hintjens

Pieter,

sorry, it still does not work, right now a request for

http://localhost/schede/pmwiki.php

becomes a path_translated like "/schede/pmwiki.php"

but the .php file is inside w:\wiki\ as per [Alias] section of defaults.cfg (so it
should become /wiki/pmwiki.php, I think, to become reachable by php.exe - or even
more a w:/wiki/pmwiki.php to take into account the possibility of an alias that
points to a different volume)

I'm still looking at cgi_main.c code of php to understand what it really uses to
find the .php file.

Thanks!

Maurilio.

Pieter,

I owe you a beer :)

With this last fix I can now correctly execute http://localhost/wiki/pmwiki.php
:) _but_ I cannot execute http://localhost/schede/pmwiki.php since, after the
first request, all links point to /wiki/ instead of /schede/.

I don't know if this is a "problem" in xitami, php.exe and/or pmwiki.php but it
is not a big problem since it is easily fixed simply having the [Alias] equal to
the folder it is aliasing:

[Alias]
    /wiki = "w:/wiki"

maybe it is enough to write

[Alias]
    /wiki = "/wiki"

if inside same volume, tomorrow I'll do some tests (and with a symlink I can have
/wiki to point to some other volume on my system :))

Thanks!

Maurilio.

?... Ah, I understand: the generated PHP page links contains the real path 
rather than the alias.  There must be another environment variable that is 
being wrongly set.  If PHP is using PATH_TRANSLATED then we are stuck because 
it means there is basically no way to run PHP scripts on an alias.

Not really a good fix since it's just avoiding the problem.  We should find 
out what variable PHP is using, and fix that.

BTW since we are on this portion of the code there is a fairly ugly
"lowercasing" bug in the ALIAS area which means that (IIRC) aliases on
case sensitive OSes (i.e. linux) have a problem with paths where the
path after the alias contains an upercase letter

E.g. if you have /alias as an alias of /usr/local/Alias is OK. But a
subdirectory (/alias/SubDirectory/ returns a 404 even if
/usr/local/Alias/SubDirectory exists

I fixed it once in one of the 2.5b releases but I stopped using Xitami
on Linux shortly thereafter and mislaid the code otherwise I'd provide
the patch. I seem to recall it required using a copy that is
lowercased for comparison and then inserting the original in the
actual path

I believe it's been fixed.  I don't see a note in the change history, but the 
aliasing code does its lower-case comparison in a temporary buffer (before it 
squashed the entire request URL to lower-case, so caused the file to be not 
found).  Unfortunately this change predates the version controlling on the 
file so I can't see when it was changed.

If someone can confirm that the problem is still there, I'll take a look.

I finally got xitame, php, and mysql to run on a thumb drive.  No  
"installation" of any files onto the host computer needed.  Just plug it  
in, run a batch file to start the programs, and start browsing.

It seems most of the trick was to make sure that all .ini files use  
relative addressing, so that everything works regardless of what drive  
letter your computer assigns to the thumb drive.  Because of this, the  
directory structure of the thumb drive cannot be changed, although  
anything under xitami/webpages/ is up to you.

I use it to demonstrate my php/mysql pages on localhost, but I'm sure the  
computer will listen and respond on whatever addresses you put in  
xitami.cfg.  The total size of the install is about 50 meg plus whatever  
size your database is, plus whatever session variables you might have  
running.  Logging of the web server is turned off.  Security is not a big  
concern for my purposes.

If anyone would like a step-by-step, copies of the .ini files, etc. feel  
free to ask.  It might be a week or two before I can get back to you,  
since I now have to take this package to a few spots around the country  
and demonstrate my pages.

If this has already been done, I apologize for taking up your time!

Hi "Exectec,"

Are you using php?  If so, I can probably help you.  If not, I'm at a  
loss, since Xitami responds to requests, and doesn't initiate any actions  
its own.

I am highly interested in this format.  I am constantly developing my 
site(s) and am tired of copying everything between 4 different computes 
(based on where I am at) - I would love to be able to just plug in my usb 
thumbdrive and start working.

Hi Michael,

I would like to get a step by step instruction, although I am not using a thumb drive now. 
But one never know for a handy tool like this. One can " just "walk around"  with the 
webserver and can show the projects which one need.
As I have not yet installed mysql on my "normal" server, if there are some detailed 
instruction in there as well, I would be happy.

Thank's already upfront for taking the time and making this available.

Here's what I'll do....I'm going away this weekend, but the beginning of  
next week I'll do a couple of web pages with instructions to set up your  
thumb drive, and I'll put them on....my thumb drive server, plug it in,  
and give you all the web address.    :-)  I used it for a lecture I did  
tonight, and it worked quite well.

Here is what I am going to use it for. I do a website for a coupl of
businesses which are all done with Xitami, PHP and mySQL. I'll put their
site on a thumbdrive and send it to them. That way they will have a back up
and if necessary can take it with them to conventions and confrences. As you
know, you don't aways have access to the internet but this will allow them
to pull up their site even though there is no access.

MySQL is the only part I don't have working so that will be a big step for
me.

Sometimes Xitami crashes due to the following errors:

(Expect-Event, Timer-Event)

Can anybody explain what's happening?

 Also the ftp server is not running stable, it also crashes often. 
Does anybody have experiences with this? It matters some 
uploads of 4mb files.

Hello

Hier geen problemen met voornoemde fouten, wij gebruiken Xitami in LAN en 
WAN omgeving (4-tal servers).
Het is wel geweten dat Xitami problemen heeft met FTP indien grote 
bestanden over een snelle verbinding (LAN) gestuurd worden. De enige 
oplossing is een andere FTP server te gebruiken.

Subject: [Xitami] defaults.cfg & aut
Message-ID: <000501c55fb8$c792b930$1201a8c0@niallpc>

I have been running xitami on a windows xp pc with all updates with success. 
I have decided to run xitami on a different pc but with the same os.  When I 
setup my defaults.cfg & aut they appear as test files and xitami cannot read 
them and therefor I cannot log into the wba.

Any suggestions

Is there a way for Xitami to start an app when Xitami starts?

No, but there are ways to start another application in addition to Xitami,  
which would have the same effect.  DOS batch files, program scheduling,  
etc.  Do you have particulars about what you are trying to do?

Never mind, I was working on the Xitami thumbdrive batch file thingie.
Because I was having problems with starting 2 batch files on inserting the
drive. I have mine working a little differently I'm starting with AutorunUSB
and AutorunPro starting both Xitami and mySQL. A few more things to iron out
but it is working pretty sweet.

I do have a little issue with winmysqladmin, putting the my.ini file in the
root dir of Windows. Have to check for an updated version.

I recently made some changes to my home network, which included a change  
of E-mail and mailing list clients.  It seems that now I am seeing new  
posts on the Xitami lists very infrequently...somewhere between 0 and 3  
per day.  Most recently, I have seen a couple of posts for last Tuesday,  
May 24, and one post for Wednesday, May 25, and no posts for the last five  
days.

Is this what everyone else is seeing?  If this is all of the activity for  
the list, great.  If not,would someone let me know about what kind of  
activity I SHOULD be seeing, so that I can go reconfigure a few things?

Thanks.
Michael

So yes; that seems to be the limit of recent activity.
