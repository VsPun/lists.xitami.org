Thank you Marc.

Oddly enough I am having a very odd error in my Visual Basic CGI too.
I know for a fact I am releasing everything in a proper manner in that
application.

However, I do the full file upload, perform a very sloppy multipart
form-data
parsing at the present, but catch the full contents of an image file.

When I write the file to disk, it will save it anywhere I tell it to.
However, when I look at the link in a html document or try to
open the image in the web viewer on the server, I cannot see the image.

It is as if it was corrupted in the upload.
Then I ftp in and download it again, and open the same uploaded file in
ACDSee
image viewer, and the image works again.
It is probably the most odd thing I've ever experienced since 1996.

Clearly I can write files to the serverside but not view them afterwards.

Thanks for the help though, it clarifies some issues I've experienced.
