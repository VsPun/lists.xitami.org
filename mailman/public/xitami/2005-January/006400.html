<PRE>TCP port 80 is all that needs to be open for HTTP.

I have not used the Xitami FTP server much, but the following applies to =
any
FTP server.

TCP port 21 must be open.

Port 20 is the FTP data port, which is used with an active FTP session. =
For
a FTP server it is not necessary to have this open since the server will
initiate it with an outgoing packet to the client. But, to use active =
FTP,
the client must have port 20 open in one way or another.. Usually done =
by
port triggering (outbound 21 will trigger inbound 20). If port 20 is not
open on the client then the client will get an error when they try to =
send a
command.

For passive FTP sessions, usually you can specify a range of ports to =
use.
For passive FTP to work, the server must have these ports open and
redirected to the FTP server. For example, you specify that you want =
passive
FTP to use ports 13000-13100, so in your firewall you would redirect all =
100
ports to your FTP server IP.

UDP ports do not need to be open for HTTP or FTP.

So to summarize, TCP 21 and 80 need to be open. And for passive FTP to =
work,
a specified range of ports must be open as well.

I looked at the Xitami configuration screen and did not see any open to
specify what range to use for passive FTP.. Maybe someone else can =
enlighten
us on how Xitami handles that.

Hope this helps.

Steve

Subject: [Xitami] Firewall/Routers &amp; UDP


Hello,

I've been using Xitami for the past three or four years, both for FTP =
and
HTTP purposes.  Throughout this time, I've achieved satisfactory =
results,
simply by forwarding ports 21 and 80 [TCP only] from the router to the
applicable PC, and opening TCP ports 21 and 80 on the software-firewall
installed to that machine.

What troubles me however, is that I constantly find myself reading posts =
on
various message-boards which have been written by people of questionable
knowledge, and with unknown skill and experience, about the set-up and
configuration of Xitami and similar web-servers in general.  Quite =
often,
they specifically instruct the user to open incoming TCP **AND** UDP =
ports
20 (???), 21, and 80... but ALWAYS fail to explain why.

I admit having very little understanding of UDP protocol... and because =
I
have very little trust for my information sources, I've refused to open =
any
incoming UDP ports (or port 20) for Xitami's use.

Is it wise of me to keep unnecessary ports closed, or am I just being
paranoid, and robbing myself of true optimization and efficiency?

   Rick
