This list really doesn't like non-Xitami promoters (for obvious reasons -
it _is_ a mailing list for Xitami).  I've been sort of relegated to &quot;Xitami
advice columnist&quot; status here because of former activity on this list
similar to yours.  Might want to tone it back a _teensy_ bit just to keep
the hardcore Xitami fans happy.

That said, they have an interesting server with a couple of features I
could swear they stole from Xitami and, erm, a couple other servers.  They
probably copied source from SFL as well.  Of course, as someone mentioned,
they probably have serious security issues that I'd be able to pick out
blindfolded.
