</I>Thanks to all those who responded. I have emailed imatix about the 
future or status of xitami development and support, and have as yet 
received no reply. I believe nothing has happened in the way of 
development with xitami since late 2004. I do really wonder whether 
there is any point in continuing to use xitami, and as I have need for 
ssl, I was considering xitami pro.

</I>2.5, perhaps I should step back to the last 2.4 stable? Are there any 
security issues if I do?
&gt;<i> What operating system is it running on?
</I>Win2k
&gt;<i> Are you running it locally or on a remote computer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It is running on a co located machine.
&gt;<i> If you are running locally, that is on your computer:

</I>&gt;<i> can anyone actually connect to your web site?
</I>Yes, everything works fine except for log files are always empty.
