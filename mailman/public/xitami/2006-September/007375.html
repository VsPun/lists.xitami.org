That was covered  back in 2004.
Here is a copy. of the instructions that should work with any version 
that contains the required files.

Alex B.,

From: Steve Winn 
Subject: RE: [Xitami] Installing Xitami as a service

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to figure
out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you figure out
what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami
2. In the \xitami\win32 folder, copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory.
Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type &quot;cd\xitami&quot; to change to the xitami
directory. Then type &quot;xisrv32.exe -i&quot; to install the service. The service is
now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run &quot;xisrv32.exe -u&quot;.

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into services
and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and start it there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you may
need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with an
account that has access.

Steve
