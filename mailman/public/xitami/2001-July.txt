Well, I downloaded 2.5b5, both for my win95 laptop and for my win2000 desktop 
and the SSI demo does not work for either. Other people are having success, 
so obviously there is something fundamental I'm doing wrong. If I install 
Xitami fresh on a system, what needs to be done just to get the SSI demo to 
run? I've added SSI_INSECURE=yes to autoexec (w95) and the env (w2k). 
Anything else, or should it now work?

I'd like to stick with this until I get it fixed, and appreciate any help 
offered.

Regards,
Carl

Hi,

I have a major problem. As I reinstalled my system (windows 98 SE), an =
error occures each time I try to start CGI or PHP script on Xitami =
server. Before reinstalling Windows98 It worked oky, no problem =
reported. But now I don't know what to do.
As I start my page expl.: "http://localhost/test/test.php" Windows just =
freeze and only hope to get back is CTRL+ALT+DEL and kill either =
InternetExplorer or Winoldap (I think it is from windows to start old =
applications). If I kill Winoldap then php executes script ok.

Where is the catch ? Does any one know, or is this just another MS bug ?

  Hi Vladimir,

  I have the same problem with perl. The problem is very common, but it 
doesn´t happens always.
  I increased the amount of memory on my machine but it didn't solve the 
problem. Something that I noticed is that when vscan and the firewall 
(zonealarm) are off the problem occurs very rarely. 
  My next try, will be chaneg the calls to the system from "system 
("perl","perl_program.pl","arqguments");" for something more windows 
compatible as the win32 perl package.

  If you find some solution let me know.

  Thanks,
 
     Gustavo

Carl,
This is a shot in the dark since I'm no Web Server Guru,
But try Installing Perl (http://www.activestate.com) see
if that changes anything for you.

Thanks for all the suggestions, but I may have left out one important 
detail. I am "serving myself." That is, Xitami, my browsers, and all 
the web pages, etc are on this machine. I can see things more like 
they will work on the production server that way. The production 
server is Apache running on some Sun/OS system out there 
somewhere.

Thanks,
Dennis

Yes, I've done that, too. Already had Perl on my laptop (cgi's work fine) and added it to my Win2000 system, still no SSI. SSI in 2.5 is supposed to work w/o Perl.

Did you get all of the Windows updates for your system?  Usually installing
IE 5.5 fixes a majority of the bugs in Windows (IE actually has kernel
updates embedded as part of the package...some people don't really care
about IE, but the updates to the OS are worth having).  I recommend
installing all of the security updates, then updating IE to v5.5, then
running the remaining security updates.  (BTW, don't install Windows Media
Player 7.1...it doesn't do anything more than 6.4 does except consume 7MB
more RAM).

If that doesn't work, try re-installing Xitami using a more stable release.

I'm running Xitami v2.4d7 without any problems (yeah, I know about the DoS
bug that's fixed in the latest version...just haven't installed it yet).

Xitami tends crash on low-memory machines or machines that run out of
memory.  If you run Xitami regularly, then I suggest getting something like
RamIdle (RamIdle is freeware and I haven't had problems with it compared to
other packages) to keep enough memory free for Xitami under Windows.  I
haven't had problems with Xitami since I have 384MB RAM and usually have
around 150MB free.

Hope that helps!

You can use a utility called NeoTrace Express to get a general idea of the
physical location of the server.

>From earier thread and answer about SSi not working:

Folks,

There is another way, I think better. I have a site
http://www.altair7.com/index.html that uses a perl script for opening =
page,
see for your self.

I do not have the SSI_INSECURE set.  I do have MIME types defined as =
following
for the master config:

.pl =3D c:\perl\bin\perlis.dll
.cgi =3D c:\perl\bin\perlis.dll

This solved all my problems.

Steps:

1. http://127.0.0.1/admin
2. configuration -> mime
3. enter the above values
4. save
5. click on restart from the main page

Done.

With that done, then this works:

http://www.altair7.com/cgi-bin/od.pl

This works with xitami 2.4d1 through 7 and xitami pro versions.

Hope that helps, always make sure that you protect your perl scripts.

Cheers,
-Roberto

Hello everybody,

I was trying to find out the link to download the XiFusion 2.5 wrapper. But
unfortunately the link on the Xitami site points to a dead link. Also the
Shinylinght website intself contains only info on ZX80 software.

How and where could I obtain the newest version for testing if Coldfusion is
something I could manage to use ?

Thanks very much for the help

Try <http://www.xitami.com/xifusion.zip>.

BTW, it's called 'Shining Light Productions' and that miserable site is
about to be wiped off the face of the planet (good riddance...it's 3-4
years old).  It will be replaced with a newer and better-looking site.  It
will still have the Z80 stuff, but it will be a whole lot faster, easier to
navigate, less pink, and will be updated much more often.

Message-ID: <200107021910.f62JA4U13178@spock.bestway.com.br>

  As I said before I´m having this kind of problems with xitami and perl cgi-
bin. I investigate a lot this kind of problem, and it happens not just with 
perl but also with php. The problem is not with xitami also. 
  The conclusion that I got is that the problem is with windows, more 
specifically in the user.exe program. There is a bug in this module related 
with dos prompt windows. They are not open during the execution of a cgi-bin, 
but in some way windows get lost with it. I don´t have a solution but a good 
point to start is searching about user.exe problems. By the way winoldap 
executes user.exe.
  I am afraid that there is no solution for this problem. 

  Bye,

    Gustavo

Hi Paul:

Many thanks for your attempts to help but to no avail.  I still can't

Actually, I have a HOSTS.SAM and a LMHOSTS.SAM.  Because I have 
seen some reference to renaming the HOSTS.SAM to simply HOSTS, 
I did that too but your instructions below continued to fail.

Yes, once I started up Xitami, I typed "localhost" in my browser and I 
got the Xitami documentation that is on my system.  I also typed 
127.0.0.1 and the same result.  Pinging both 127.0.0.1 and localhost 
resulted in positive results.

Didn't!  This may be where the instructions fail but I continued along 
with the rest of your suggestions anyway.

Given the suggestion of yours below that since I had originally 
installed Xitami on H:\Xitami and the webpages for stc are at 
O:\Websites\stc, I then uninstalled Xitamin and reinstalled it in 
O:\Xitami and moved the stc webpages to 
O:\Xitami\webpages\stc\public_html\.

No luck

Ok, I think I understand but I think other problems exist that are 
preventing it for working properly.

I moved the webpage files as I stated above.

I do that too.

Paul:

I have had success.

I setup HOSTS.SAM with

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.0.1 stc

and saved the file.

I then installed Xitami in O:\Xitami and copied the stc files to 
O:\Xitami\webpages\stc\public_html\.  I setup the stc "site" begins 
at "./webpages/stc/public_html/" (and cgi-bin begins at 
"./webpages/stc/cgi-bin/" and ftp root is at "./webpages/stc/").  I 
also setup the stc "site" so that it uses the DNS name of "stc" which 
is tied to the configuration file of "stc.cfg".

I restarted Xitami and typed "stc" in the location bar.  This time, I 
let IE dial up and once it connected with my ISP, IE then showed me 
my stc "site".  I am puzzled by the need to connect to my ISP because 
everytime I try a link within my stc site, it needs to connect to my 
ISP.

Technically, it is working but I wonder if anyone knows how to 
prevent it from dialing my ISP (I am using Win98SE).

Do you have these set in the

[Filter]
    .shtm=perlssi

    .ssi=perlssi

however other than the Exec=1 the others are defult

make sure you have the path to perl set

I downloaded what I thought was the latest production Win32

  http://users.skynet.be/sky37432/bs3224d9.exe

Installed clean: on a new machine and also to a new folder on a
machine that already had Xitami 2.7.

In three tries, it installs without complaint, but there is no
Xitami/cgi-bin folder extracted or installed, and no Testcgi.exe
program. (There is a cgi-src folder with the usual contents; no
cgi-bin folder.)

Is it just me or is it supposed to be this way?

I guess it's normal in current implementation. SSI does not accept

hey julian the sam bit of hosts.sam means sample and the file needs to be
saved as hosts ...most txt editors even add an extension to it when you dont
select one so the answer is to rename it from windows explorer or from the
disc directly ...hope this helps

ps if your dns host allows dynanic dns (i think its called) where any
name.yourdomain.com is pointed to yourdomain.com then you could vhost easily
(assuming you have a domain name pointed at your pc)

Yes, I have set all the recommended vars in the cfg file, autoexec, everywhere. No matter what I do, no matter what system or OS, the SSI stuff does not work. I've tried two revs of 2.4 and two revs of 2.5... each time the SSI call gets passed through unparsed, just as if it were a normal comment line.

Thanks for the suggestions, any more?

Hi everyone:

If you have been following this thread, you will remember that I was 
able to get Xitami to deliver my local websites (ie on my hard drive) 
to my browser.  Because the current site I am developing cannot use 
SSI (their hosting package does not allow it and they don't want to 
pay for the upgrade), I have yet to test that feature.  However, 
absolute paths work perfectly.

The only drawback that I encounter is that everytime I want to 
browse a new page or refresh the current one, Win98SE wants me to 
connect to my ISP before it would show me the new page.  This was 
true with IE 5.5 and Opera 5.1 but when I tried Netscape 6.0, I found 
that I could cancel the dialup and it would show me the page I wanted 
to see.  Furthermore, because I cancelled the dialup, Netscape 6 did 
not ever ask for my ISP again which means that I can browse my 
"local" site as if I was not running Xitami.  It is slower than not using 
Xitami (I know that N6 is a bit of a pig too) but it is not 
unreasonable and the benefits of making my local site act like a 
"true" hosted site is tremendous.

Therefore, for anyone wanting to setup Xitami for the same 
purposes as myself would be recommended to use N6 as the test 
browser.

Hi people

i have had a very annoying problem that i finally figured out last week and
thought i might share with you all.

i found a neat php4 installer that included xitami in its list of servers
and having experienced the troubles that a lot of you mentioned here
installing php i decided to give it a shot.

when i chose xitami as the server it came back with a repy "sorry cant find
xitami".

i thought bugger .. and went off to get the lastest version assuming it was
installed into a different directory.

i was right and the installer worked fine, but after this i had problems
with some perl scripts that simply wouldnt work.

i chased the obvious paths etc and still nothing but noticed new scripts
added with the .pl extension worked fine.

last week i decided to sort it ..got the lastest version of xitami and perl
ran the installs and still a few scripts failed but as per before.
if i ran the old version of xitami i was using everything worked fine.

in the early days of hosting i had found that using no extension instead of
.pl or .cgi forced windows to rely on the #! perl line in the script so i
renamed realland.pl to realland , but also had a realland.exe in the cgi
bin.
now using /cgi-bin/realland my script worked but i didnt seem to be able to
change (edit)anything.

finally it hit me the realland script wasnt being accessed at all.
for some reason either xitami or win2k was giving  realland.exe the priority
and using that instead of realland and realland.pl gave a 500 error.

i renamed my realland.exe to reallandtest.exe and realland.pl started
working instantly as well as changes made in either realland or realland.pl
being visable.

my exe files are made with perl2xe if anyone wants to try and replicate this
problem

This is a "feature"; apparently there were some complaints about
shipping with testcgi.exe installed by default (for security reasons)
so it got removed from the install set.  I suspect that the cgi-bin
directory isn't being created because it is empty.

Possibly what we'll do next time is include a cgi-bin-eg type
directory with those in it.

Of course. Xitami looks for the exact name. If that fails, it tries the
name with EXE COM and BAT appended. If you ask for "foo", and there is
no "foo", it looks for "foo.exe", "foo.com", "foo.bat". 

So realland.exe will be found, and realland.pl won't be found unless you
give the full file name. 

> using no extension instead of .pl or .cgi forced windows to rely on the #! perl line in the script 

Actually, Windows does not know #! at all, Xitami is doing that.

OK, then it is a feature. 

I did have doubts about leaving testcgi.exe out in public. I guess it
does no harm if people know my CPU is "x86 Family 5 Model 2 Stepping
12", but COMSPEC gives the exact full path to a command processor, and
some other lines give local paths to non-public places. 

Thanks for clarifying. 

Making those tools available, as a dummy folder or as another package to
download, would be nice. Is it just testcgi.exe? My old folder is full
of stuff, and I forget what came with X2.47.

Thanx paul ...perhaps i didnt make it clear that realland realland.pl and
realland.exe were all present and i was using the full path for these.

realland appeared to be working but it was in fact realland.exe that was
doing the job.

only when the exe was renamed did realland and realland.pl respond
correctly.

both realland.pl and realland.exe were copied from the cgi-bin in the old
version (the xiwin dir) to the new (xitami/cgi-bin/) dir and worked
seperately in the old dir if i started the old version of xitami.
it appears to me that the new versions are giving the .exe file preference
even when the exact path to the .pl file is used while the old versions did
not.

Hi All,

I have a question for the experts out there regarding IP routing
and purchasing Class C blocks of IP addresses. I'd like to know:

	- Who do you buy a block of IP's from.
	- Can you then use them on any computer you choose.

Actually have lots of basic questions on this stuff. If someone
could point me to a website or email me off the list, I would
appreciate it. Thank you again all!

David,

You don't buy ip addresses. You purchase internet access from an ISP and they supply
your ip addresses. They buy big blocks and subdivide them. Sort of like a land
developer. You buy a domain name from one of the many places that are now selling them.
You can then have as many subdomains as you want, or that you can afford, depending on
your isp's requirements.

Good Luck!
Dennis

Yes, the only CGI that was being shipped by default was testcgi.exe.

My personal feeling is that the default configuration of most programs
is insecure in some respect, so that one should always do things like
remove the default CGI programs.  And hence it wasn't such a big deal.

But general 'net experience says that there are a lot of people that
don't remove/disable insecure default items, so I guess a little
paranoia is called for.

At present, no.  Good idea though.  The closest thing is the setuid
features of Xitami (which currently work only under Unix; you can do
something similar with the service version for Windows NT); but the
setuid feature only lets you change which uid Xitami runs as once (and
all CGIs will also run as that uid).

access.log; and any logs you may have defined for virtual hosts.  HTTP
and FTP are mixed together, in a sometimes slightly confusing fashion.

There's lots of log processing tools which will turn those logs (in
common log format by default) into pretty webpages, etc.

As others have noted, these headers are non-standard, and basically only
an IE/IIS communication channel.

However that said, Xitami tries to make all the headers that it gets
available as HTTP_... headers to CGI/filter/LRWP programs if that
option is turned on (it is by default: [cgi] http-fields=1 and [cgi]
http-prefix=HTTP_).  So in theory I would expect the headers that you
mention to be available like that as well.

If this isn't happening for some reason we'd need to look at whether IE
is passing them as "real" headers, or as something else that is special.

These people that are connecting: where are they connecting from?  The
LAN that you set up?  Or the Internet?  Where is Xitami running?  On the
Internet-facing machine?  Or on the one that is only on the LAN?  And
did you really use the same IP address on both machines?

Probably the setup you describe can be made to work: but we need to know

This is a browser feature: when browsers have something cached, they
send get-if-modified requests to see if they need a new copy of it,
which Xitami answers correctly.  However by default most browsers are
configured to check "once per session" -- which saves time and network
traffic, but can mean that you don't see the new page until you force a
reload if it changes during your session.

You can either change your browser setting, or force a reload -- or
force a particular page to not be cached (as others have described).

The only Xitami-related bit is that Xitami can be told to cache
index.html type defaults (to save opening/closing them all the time);
[server] cache-defaults=[0/1] controls this.

The link on the Xitami site for the XiFusion 2.5 wrapper is correct;
however something on the Shining Light website doesn't like it being
used.  If you use it manually it is okay, but if you click on the link
it fails (perhaps because the website is set up not to accept access to
the links from outside).

There's a cached copy at:

http://www.xitami.com./xifusion.zip

If we can't make the link to the Shining Light website work, I'll update
the link to point at that cached copy.  Any comments Thomas?

I think you missed the part where I said the browsers work correctly
when the pages are served from an Apache/linux server. And, I have my browsers 
setup to check every time, and at least one of the pages has a no-cache meta tag. Has all the indications of being a Xitami problem.

What is the extension on the file that you are trying to have processed
for SSIs?  By default Xitami only processes a few extensions: .ssi,
.shtml.

You can set up a webmask list which denies that one address and allows
everything else _and_ allows access without a password.  But it may
block more than one person (eg, if they're using their ISPs proxy
cache), and may not block them completely (eg, if they have more than
one account).

If you need to explicitly block someone from a site that often means you
have to require everyone to log in, and then ban the person you don't
want.

Can you try it with Xitami in debug mode then?  [server] debug=1.  The
details in the debug.log and request.log may well indicate what is going
on.  Possibly it is a date parsing/processing issue of some sort.

Actually, testcgi is a key part of debugging/testing my Perl/PHP/CGI/etc.
programs.  It works properly every time, so I can count on it to return
data about the current environment...well, under Linux anyway (Windows is
weird in the environment variable arena).

I think I replied via personal e-mail about this to the OP.

Crosswinds.net has officially denied direct access to files without going
through a webpage on the server first.  Right now I'm in the middle of
moving my entire website to my own machine for self-hosting.  Maybe later
this evening I'll go live...right now it still looks a bit like it is still
being developed :)

(As well as not being completely secure - I need to run the latest
installation to upgrade Xitami and then a couple tests).

Subject: [Xitami] SSI Help desperately needed
Message-ID: <67729171.69DD503E.0EEEC7A4@cs.com>

Right now I'm just trying to get the SSI demo page to work, xitami/testpages/testssi.ssi. I have just installed xitami on another system running Win98 and right off the bat SSI does not work. This is 2.5b5, which I recall does not require Perl and should not need any additional settings (like SSI_INSECURE=yes or exec=1) for a simple <!--#include file="blahblah"--> to work, which is all I need in my.

Again, is there anything I'm missing? Can anyone else do a fresh install on a new system and get the SSI test page to work?

Do you mean that when you type http://www.geocities.com/ (for example), you
want to go to your local Xitami server? If so, then create a file named
"HOSTS" in the Windows directory (or edit it if it already exists), and add
the following line to it:

127.0.0.1    www.geocities.com

You don't need to set up any virtual hosts, etc, in Xitami.

Actually you can't do that unless you host your own DNS server as well...of
course you would then not be able to upload anything to geocities.com until
you disabled the DNS server, uploaded, then re-enabled the DNS server.
That's too much of a pain in the neck if you ask me.

My question is, if you are using a static host for your site, why bother
with a web server?  You can write static-HTML on your computer and it will
look the same both locally and remotely (providing the remote host doesn't
use case-sensitive filenames...but that just requires a bit of fore-thought
- and Xitami is _NOT_ a case-sensitive server under Windows).

All the "online" and "offline" browsing modes do is determine whether to
use already cached pages or to get them from the remote server.  It really
has little relation to web page development since you want to be in
"online" mode anyway or nothing will change when you reload the page.

If you want to have more power, you can host your own web page with
Xitami...which is what its true purpose is.  If all you are going to do is
create static webpages for some other host, you are probably missing the
point of a web server (the point is to serve web pages from your computer
to other people...not to test static pages to upload to geocities).  I
suggest checking out <http://www.dhs.org/>.  It may be a bit confusing for
you, but I highly recommend their dynamic DNS service if you want to host
your own website (and don't have a static IP address).

Hope this helps!

Yeah, you can do that too...the person still has the same problem (in this
case changing the HOSTS file back again) when they want to go and actually
upload/test it on the remote server.

I am running two versions of Xitami, the standard, and the Pro.

I've been running the standard for several months with no problems,
but now I go to run the Pro alongside it, and everytime it starts, it
suspends itself. Is there any way around this? I checked the logs, and
it's not showing any errors at all. 

The FTP Server is shut off on both, and on the standard, HTTP runs on
port 80. On the Pro, I set a port base of 10, so HTTP runs at 90, but
HTTPS still runs at 443, it seems to be working fine, but just
suspends itself on start up.

Thank you for any ideas with this.
Jeff

Xitami normally only suspends itself (automatically) when it cannot
talk
to the network for some reason.  Looking in the log might give you
some
idea what it is having problems with (eg, the console.log) in
situations
like this.

Pro runs in console mode if you are running v2.4c1.  Just press Ctrl-C to
stop it and it should shut down cleanly.  Not sure about more recent
versions of Pro.

If you put the standard version in the same directory as the Pro version,
then there will be conflicts with the configurations (Xitami standard might
be detecting changes to log files and thus suspends itself).  You should
re-install both and put them in separate directories.  To make both
versions work well together in separate directories, point Pro's Xitami.cfg
[Server]->webpages variable to the standard's webpages directory...be sure
to spell out the directory path letter for letter (e.g. Program Files, not
Progra~1) or you will get strange errors.  You can point Standard to Pro,
they should just point to the same place.

Hope this helps!

Does Xitami support ASP Active Server Documents and if
so do I need a interperter like Active Perl for perl
and cgi scripts

No.  There are some third party addons that will add some support, but
basically ASP is a Microsoft thing.

If you want to run perl scripts you'll need a perl interpreter.

I did figure it out, it had to do with a port confliction that I had
missed. Just had to change the LWRP port in xitami.cfg, and that took
care of it. 

Thanks for your help.

Pro runs in console mode if you are running v2.4c1.  Just press Ctrl-C
to
stop it and it should shut down cleanly.  Not sure about more recent
versions of Pro.

If you put the standard version in the same directory as the Pro
version,
then there will be conflicts with the configurations (Xitami standard
might
be detecting changes to log files and thus suspends itself).  You
should
re-install both and put them in separate directories.  To make both
versions work well together in separate directories, point Pro's
Xitami.cfg
[Server]->webpages variable to the standard's webpages directory...be
sure
to spell out the directory path letter for letter (e.g. Program Files,
not
Progra~1) or you will get strange errors.  You can point Standard to
Pro,
they should just point to the same place.

Hope this helps!

Subject: [Xitami] Running 2 Servers on 1 Computer
Message-ID: <te0gktohtegce6a66ntulpjlt3nsbmha34@4ax.com>

OK, I have another question for everyone...

I've been running Xitami for several months now, and it's been working
great. My needs have changed, and for one site, I'll be setting up a
shopping cart that needs to be secured for credit card payments. What
would be the best way to set this up.

Do I just run the Pro version, and have it handle everything,
including Virtual Hosting? Or, do I run them both, and have the Pro
version just handle the secure CC entry pages?

Currently I have them both running, and I have the baseport on the pro
set at 10, so there isn't any confliction with the other server, since
I'm currently not using the pro version for port 80 hosting anyways.

This is all still pretty new to me, so any ideas/help/criticism would
be appreciated. 

Thank you,
jeff

Sure.  Unless you've got a specific reason for having both Xitami/Pro
and Xitami running (some dramatically different configuration that
cannot be merged together), then Xitami/Pro can do everything that
Xitami will do "and more".  So you need only run Xitami/Pro: it'll
handle virtual hosting, HTTP/HTTPS/FTP, etc.  HTTPS virtual hosting is
tricky (needs to be IP address based) but if you're using HTTPS only for
a single secure order site that shouldn't be an issue.

jeff set both pro and std to use the same pages with pro running on
different ports.
pro will only be called when there is a call to https and will dish out the
pages on port 443 ...you may have to tell  std that https = :443 in the
filters section but im not sure for the latest versions ?

Yes, I just want to test my sites and also learn server-scripting languages
(executing my scripts) using my computer both as server and as browser. I
tried to modify the "hosts" file but it doesn't work, Xitami Hostname is
still http://mycomputername. What can I do?

My problem is that I want to create dynamic pages too and test if all the
links I wrote are correct and really poit to existent pages, simply using my
computer both as server and browser. It's a thing that is not connected to
geocities, that was just an example... I don't know if I need a server, but
I thought yes... Another question, where can I find informations about how
servers work? The Xitami manual start with a lot of things that you should
already know, but I need to start from the beginning.

As Ewan has said, there are third-party add-ons which will work with
Xitami (amongst other http daemons) to provide ASP.

One that I have tried is iASP == instant ASP from HalcyonSoft.  If you go
to http://www.halcyonsoft.com/ and navigate your way around the menus,
you will find that there is a "developer's edition" which is a free
download (after answering some questions).  This is a slightly limited
version of the full commercial product, in that one is limited to only
ten sessions (the web site says two, but Halcyon have assured me that
it's ten).

I had been intending to use this, along with Xitami, to provide a
platform for an annual "DIY e-Commerce" course that we run at the end of
our undergraduates' first year.  Unfortunately, I discovered a gaping
hole in Halcyon's implementation of VBScript; one cannot instantiate the
RegExp class.  Since some of the lecturer's code depends upon using this
(and other classes), iASP was not "fit for purpose", so sadly this year
we did as in previous years and used M$'s IIS 4.0 --- a shame, because we
wanted to encourage the thought-process that Microsoft is not the only
way of doing things.

Halcyon assured me that this "bug" would be fixed in v2.0 of iASP, but
with a fixed timescale we did not have the luxury of waiting for this to
be released.

Incidentally, iASP works on other platforms apart from Windoze, so with
Xitami provides an ASP capability of Linux, for example.

Access it.  It should "just work".

What happens when you try to access it?  Is there anything in the log
files?  What about if you put Xitami into debug mode ([Server] debug=1)
and try again -- what does the debug.log say?

SSI_INSECURE is needed only for running programs (CGIs, etc); the basic
SSI substitutions will work without it.

The Host: header is compulsory in HTTP/1.1, which has been out for about
2 years IIRC.  It was widely supported before that, and pretty much
everything that has been produced in the last 5-6 years has used the
Host: header.  Basically I don't see any problem using Host:-based
virtual hosting any longer; there are very very few people using the
older HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0-without-Host: browsers now, and a lot of
sites that won't work for them if they continue to do so.

If you're really bothered, put all the virtual hosts in subdirectories
and make the base configuration point at each subdirectory so that users
can choose which one that they want.

The default hostname _will_ be the name of your computer.  Providing you
use HTTP/1.1-style Host: headers everything should work fine anyway; but
if you really can't do that, you can override [Server] hostname.

I've been a lurker for some time now, I'm using Xitami on a win98 machine
with all the current updates and a dynamic dial up IP (hoping someone will
offer cable or DSL where we live soon). What I'm looking for is a piece of
software that will detect when my machine goes on and off line and close and
start Xitami at the appropriate times so that the IP address is correct.
I've tried using ICQ and Net cruiser, both will run Xitami but it closes 2
seconds later and unfortunately if either of these managed to start the
server they don't offer the facility to close it when the computer gets
disconnected.

I hope this explains my dilemma, anybody got any ideas?

  Check out NetLaunch at
http://www.blackcastlesoft.com.  It will dial your isp
for you, can be set up on a schedule and will launch
and close programs on connect and disconnect.

What does "does not work" mean?  You get an error?  You get the page

It's very hard to diagnose "does not work" remotely :-)

Hello!

I am having trouble understanding how to set up the virutal host system.
I am new to this, but catch on quickly. Could you guide me a little it
on how to set it up?


Thanks!!

Hello Again...

I am also looking for a DNS server software that can be run on the same
PC, so I may have the control over the domain names, and where they will
be referred to.

Thanks again....

Use the web based admin for a quick start to virtual hosting.  You'll
need to sort out DNS entries (so that the name points at your IP
address) separately.

Well, I am lost to how exactly to do that, Ewen. I have 12 domain names,
and I am told I need a DNS server in order to use Xitami as a
multi-domain web host. I only have 1 IP, and I want to be able to use
the web server for a hosting system. This is my first time at setting up
a hosting center, and I want to do it right the first time. LOL!!! I
know that won't happen, but I need to learn.
I have been using the server for a while, testing, and learning, but the
Virtual Hosting has thrown me, time and again....
I find the server software superb, for as much as I know about them.
Again, I am learning.


Thanks Again for all you do to help...

Ron,

This is just an example...
1) defaults.cfg
[Virtual-Hosts]
www.douglasdemocrat.com=dd.cfg # site www.douglasdemocrats.com
www.orangekitty.com=ok.cfg     # site www.orangekitty.com
douglasdemocrat.com=dd.cfg # what if someone just types in
                           # douglasdemocrats or organgekitty.com?!
orangekitty.com=ok.cfg     # ....this handles that!

[Server]
Webpages=webpages

Now, do not put anything under webpages or the default pages you would like
served, say for my_business_domain.com (your
business!?).

2) dd.cfg
[Server]
Webpages=c:\douglasdemocrats (or /var/douglasdemocrats or whatever)

c:\douglasdemocrats -> all your files related to the democratic party of
douglas county
3) ok.cfg
[Server]
Webpages=c:\orangekitty

c:\orangekitty -> all files related to orang kitty web site

Now, remember if you IP address is 111.222.333.444, you _must_ have DNS
records setup (or request your ISP to do) such that both
these domains point to your server's IP address (111.222.333.444).  This is
the key for the whole setup to work!

Hope this helps.

There isn't a way to do this at present (although it's a good idea,
which has been suggested before).  Generally for most sites forcing
HTTPS doesn't gain you very much other than avoiding the possibility of
users accidentally sending things in plain text they might not want to
do so.  However that's usually balanced against allowing users to do so
if they're really not able to use HTTPS.

the binary that is on the website is (a) an older version, and (b) was

changes under BeOS now, so if someone is interested in recompiling it,
please feel free.

For example the images located in ./webpages/images do not load

This is rather puzzling.  It's almost as if the path definitions are
wrong.  You might want to turn on server debugging mode ([Server] debug=1)
and see what path locations it is trying with each request.  And you
might also want to compare the configuration file in the Windows version
(or source package) with the ones in the BeOS one, just in case they are
wrong for some reason.

>Another serious issue for me is that when Xitami is started, cpu load for my

It sounds like it's getting stuck in a loop for some reason.  Normally
Xitami should "go to sleep" waiting for the OS to tell it that someone
has sent it a request to deal with.  For some reason this doesn't seem
to be happening for you.

Has anyone else found this with the BeOS version?  (I don't have access
to a BeOS version to test.)

If there's anyone who's built Xitami from source under BeOS, they could
perhaps turn on the tracing functions and try to figure out where it is
looping.

It sounds like Xitami isn't picking up the new settings for some reason;
some of the settings are only checked fairly early in the startup phase,
and it's possible that is one of them.

Have you tried exiting from Xitami (ie, not just stopping it in the
control panel, but actually quitting the application) and restarting it?
Did that make a difference?  (Other than forcing Xitami to start from
scratch I can't see what a reboot would do differently.)

If we can narrow down what is causing this problem we can put it onto
our bug list.

Xitami doesn't handle drive letters like that (as you say, some Windows
based FTP servers do).  Instead Xitam insists that you define an alias
that points at the other drive, and that people use that alias instead.

As you've found there are some issues with the Xitami FTP support, and
it doesn't always seem to play nicely with others.  A number of these
issues are on our bug list, but meanwhile if you need some of the
features in other FTP servers you are probably better disabling the
internal FTP server in Xitami, and using another one alongside it.

This sounds very strange.  It sounds like Windows is causing problems
with Xitami trying to run programs.  We've seen this occassionally if
you have a virus scanner running, or some other security product that
tries to restrict what programs can do (Xitami needs to be able to run
other programs, to do CGI/filters).  

If you do have a virus scanner running or some other security product,
try disabling it briefly and see if the problem with Xitami and
CGI/filters goes away.  If it does, it's a conflict between the two
things.

If you don't have either a virus scanner or security product running, it
sounds a bit like something has got messed up with your Windows install
-- although that's a little suspicious given that it sounds like a
relatively recent install.  But sometimes Windows is just like that :-(

:-(  One really silly question: you said you had two Xitami instances
running: are you 100% sure that you're restarting the right one? :-)

Otherwise I'm rather puzzled as to what might be causing the problem.

a thought about reinstalling windows

windows 98 especially, but also win95, goes in search of any existing
version of windows on your hard drive ..in my experience it then cheats and
uses the settings from the previous install where ever it can.

assuming you reinstalled cause you had a problem the odds are this problem
still exists

the answer is to totally remove windows by deleting its directory and all
the system files before reinstalling the new version.

To start Xitami from another program is fairly simple to do (e.g. the
system() command in C).

To shut down Xitami from another program is a bit more difficult:
First, enumerate all the Windows and loop through them until you run into
the window name "xiwin32" or "xitami" or something like that.
Then, send a WM_QUIT message to it (or you could try sending the
appropriate message to suspend Xitami instead - WM_QUIT is easier, though).
 Xitami should shut down.

Look under the RAS Services section of MSDN for details on connection
information.

So, here is how your program would work:

1)  Wait for RAS to connect successfully to the Internet.
2)  Start Xiami.
3)  Wait for RAS to disconnect.
4)  Shut down Xitami.
5)  Repeat until you cause your program to quit.

I don't think there is any other way to accomplish what you want to do.
So, now might be a good time to learn how to write Windows programs.
Otherwise, keep searching - there is probably a utility, I just don't need
to use it (cable modems are very nice - 100-200K/sec transfers on avg.).

Thanks Ewen! I will try to set them up similar to what you sent me.

Also, I have been told there is several free DNS server software
programs available, but I cannot seem to find them. Do you have any
Links for them? Also, I have Visual C++ 6, and if there is an open
source program available, I could compile that type, if it is out
there...


Thanks again!!!

Apache uses HTTPS="on" as well as setting SSL environment information to
let CGI applications know that they are being run on a secure protocol.  I
think setting HTTPS="on" is enough for 99% of the CGIs being run out there.

I had a question when I want to lock something out and
I download a cgi script called lockout.cgi and
configure it ect and it makes two files call .htaccess
and .htpasswd and I have been told that these are
suppost to be picked up by the server and run like you
do when you run http://127.0.0.1. It is suppost to
require a username and password.  Am I doing something
wrong I can't seem to figure it out?
Can anyone help?

Thanks, 
Nick

I'm sure of that!  This was a problem before I split it to two instances of
xitami.  It also occurred with the previous beta, though I am using the
current one (2.5b5.)  FYI, I use one instance on port 2080 that I rarely
shutdown.  The other on the standard port I restart twice a day.

Thanks!!

I keep trying to tell people to re-install IE 5.5 and the security updates
first before re-installing Windows...and if they haven't, then do so.  IE
has _kernel updates_ embedded in it that will repair ailing OSes.  I've
literally brought PCs back from the dead (one had 4 different viruses on it
and they had trashed a lot of the data) just by (re)installing IE (which
restored the OS data - F-PROT took care of the remaining mess).

I don't use a real-time virus scanner either.  I just use a good ol' DOS
program called F-PROT and maintain my knowledge of how viruses *REALLY*
work (many people think they are magical and McAfee is magical too...or
something like that - guess what...neither are magical).  F-PROT is
freeware, scans more viruses than McAfee's bloated piece of junk, and is
the tool of choice for removing viruses from virtually-dead machines (even
viruses designed for Windows).

Finally, Xitami and CGIs will crash if there is not enough memory
available.  Suggestion:  Install RamIdle.  It is an excellent freeware
product.

Hope this helps!

Those are used by Apache webserver.

Xitami does not use that form of access control.

Xitami has a password protection feature. It is demonstrated on
the default home page when you install Xitami.

Hello:

I'm running the NT service version of 2.5b5 on Win2k and I'm wondering
if this version has a tray icon to indicate that the service is running,
and perhaps giving indications that the server is being accessed. 
Nothing shows up in my tray area.

Thanks for the great software :-)

No.  IIRC, there's a control panel that you can get at through the NT
services area, but that's it.  Services just exist in the background.

Thanks Thomas, but your answer is a bit beyond my capabilities at the
moment, I tried the previous suggestion, "Net Launch" works great and is a
good utility for "windows" programs, but though it tries it can't close the
DOS window, so I'm still stuck.  Guess I'll just have to keep looking.
Meantime I'll get my C++ books out and maybe I'll learn how to program for
windows and write my own utility, before I can find one that someone else
has written.

Hi Gerry for nt there is a resource called kill.exe which allows you to

Currently the only way to change the HTTP port is to change the port
base, which shifts _everything_ up by that base amount, including FTP.

Some FTP clients let you specify which port number to connect to, in
this case 1021, eg:

ftp HOSTNAME PORT

which may let you work around that.

Alternatively as a work around you can set the FTP port in the
configuration file to a sufficient negative number to offset the amount
it is shifted, and get you back to the standard port 21, eg, (21-1000) =
-979.

This is on our bug list, and eventually there'll be a way to change just
the HTTP port number.

hi ewen,

Thanks for the reply.

But this is not working.I am quite strange everything
works finw with default port 80.

The reason,I have to run xitami on different port is,i
am already running apache on port 80.That's why.Just
for FTP i don't change the port of apache.

Take care,

Ad

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami for BeOS
Message-ID: <NEBBJNPBILLCPIGFCBEDEEEBCBAA.fveggerby@fdf.dk>

HI there.

I've tried the port of Xitami for BeOS. Look good BUT....
I have some problems:
FTP hangs when logging on. I've read that the NT version 2.5b4 has the same
problem.
Admin-section doesn't work, I believe it's a problem with tha path to
images, which is acting weird.

Do you have any solutions/ideas????

I've enabled outside admin, and trying to use it from Win98, the reason I
need it is because the server physically is placed 65 km away, I can
sometimes load the admin pages on the server, but never from the outside, I
get login, and it tries to load but can't (hangs). When I load the server it
says "web server binding to address 127.0.0.1", can this be the problem, the
rest of the web server is working fine, except sometimes the images is
missing. The FTP server is enabled and I get Welcome text, logon OK,
Logintext OK and then ex. CuteFTP says:
STATUS:>	Login successful
COMMAND:>	TYPE I
	200 Command okay
COMMAND:>	pwd
	257 "/" is the current directory

	200 Command okay

and then I'm stuck. It doesn't matter what user I'm logging on as.

I hope you can make something of this.

Subject: [Xitami] POST troubles (longish)
Message-ID: <01C10BA4.D1051D80.boyan@sanbolic.com>

Here is the story. Yesterday downloaded dcl - a project tracking system 
written in PHP. At startup you have to login, supplying username and 
password.
But as long as I click the Login button on the startup screen, I get a 404 
error.
The Xitami access log looks like this:
127.0.0.1 - - [12/Jul/2001:17:06:14 +0200] "POST /login.php3 HTTP/1.1" 404 
97 "http://localhost/index.php3" ""

As you can see, the index.php3 is the main file with the login screen, 
which posts the username and the password to login.php3. login.php3 is 
there, I checked that, even checked the case.

The most curious thing is that a similar system, Keystone, written in PHP 
as well, works just fine:
127.0.0.1 - - [12/Jul/2001:17:39:59 +0200] "POST /keystone/nbrowse.php3 
HTTP/1.1" 200 13095 "http://localhost/keystone/index.php3" ""
The only difference between Keystone and dcl that I can see is that 
Keystone, unlike dcl, doesn't use JavaScript. Otherwise both use <form 
method="post" action="[filename].php3"> </form>

By the way, I just changed the filename from login.php3 to the_login.php3 - 
changed it both in the template for the page and on disk, of course. The 
result is:
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Jul/2001:13:41:28 +0200] "POST /the_login.php3 HTTP/1.1" 
404 97 "http://localhost/index.php3" ""

System: Windows 2000 Pro (no SP), Xitami 2.4d9 service, PHP 4.0.4, IE 5.0

Some more logs comparison.

Any help is greatly appreciated

I recently upgraded to 2.4 d9 and am now seeing alot more .lwo files
being left in my .temp directory than before.

I am running xitami on WinME

Is there something I forgot to set when I upgraded?



Also, (and this may be related), is there any reason why .lwos (ie
lrwps) may not be compatible with Netscape 6?

Thanks

I need someone to take a perl script I have and make it so that
I can pass form values to it. I know just about nothing when it
comes to perl thats why I was looking for someone to help.

Anyone able to offer a hand? It's very very simple. I can do it

> take a perl script I have and make it so that I can pass form values to it. I know just about nothing when it comes to perl 

Xitami parses form values into the Environment with the prefix "POST_"
(this can be configured). 

Perl lets you read the Environment in an array called $ENV{}. Note the
curly-braces... in some fonts they look like parenthesis, but aren't!

If the form has fields named "name" and "gender", use this to print the
values: 

 print "Name            $ENV{FORM_name}\n";
 print "Gender          $ENV{FORM_gender}\n";

Instead of "print", you can assign to variables and do something else.

Perl variable names are case sensitive. name is not the same as Name. 

> it doesn't show me anything on the page.

Always have some simple literal text that "must" display, without any
tricky variables or calculations: 

 print "Hello there! You typed: \n";

Then you know if the script is sick, or you just printed an invalid
variable. 

> The script doesn't return any errors....

The script you cited will never barf-back errors (they may go out into a
log file, but in this case probably not). 

Start all your CGI Perl scripts with this: 

 use strict;
 use CGI qw(:standard);
 use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);

"strict" will catch many "easy" errors. 

The "fatalsToBrowser" option of CGI Carp will send error messages to you
(in the browser) rather than in some obscure log file. You "may" want to
disable this when your script runs perfectly; but in debugging it is a
real time saver.

There is an even better version of this error catching code but I don't
have it handy. It catches compile-time errors and lets you set a custom
message.

Did you start with a new set of configuration files?  If not it sounds
like it might be in your configuration file.  Xitami tries to recognise
the host name passed in and use that to figure out which directory to
use: for some reason it sounds like in your case the names aren't
matching.  You'd probably be best checking spelling, etc, carefully.  Or
turning on the server debugging ([Server] debug=1), and checking the
debug log carefully for what Xitami is doing internally.

Hmmm.  In theory these should be deleted after they have been sent (they
contain LRWP responses that are bigger than 16KB).  Do you have any of
the debugging options in Xitami turned on (some of these disable
removing temporary files).

>Also, (and this may be related), is there any reason why .lwos (ie
>lrwps) may not be compatible with Netscape 6?

Not as far as I know.  The data you're returning may have some
incompatibility with Netscape 6, but as far as I know there's nothing
about the LRWP process per se which would give trouble.

Just thought you all would like to know that running two different Xitami
servers on different ports do not mix (in theory they were running on two
different ports).  They both decided to be cute and proceeded to handle
requests on port 80 at the same time...the result?  Disaster.  No
seg-faults, just a _really_ ugly webpage.

The following two functions will extract each value from STDIN (where form
values are placed) and put them into a hash.  Just use '&ParseForm();'
(without the quotes) to parse the data into the 'values' hash, then you
access your form variables using '$values{FormName}' to access each
individual element of the form data.

sub ParseForm
{
  local ($fields, $name, $value, $data);

  read(STDIN, $data, $ENV{"CONTENT_LENGTH"});
  @fields = split(/&/, $data);

  foreach $item (@fields)
  {
    ($name, $value) = split(/=/, $item);
    $name = &UnescapeString($name);
    $value = &UnescapeString($value);
    $values{$name} = $value;
  }
}

sub UnescapeString
{
  local ($s) = $_[0];
  local ($pos, $ascii);

  $s =~ s/\+/ /g;       # Replace the + sign with spaces

  $pos = 0;             # Replace %xx with hexadecimal
  while (($pos = index($s, "%", $pos)) != -1)
  {
    $ascii = hex(substr($s, $pos + 1, 2));
    substr($s, $pos, 3) = pack("c", $ascii);
  }
  $s;
}


Hope that helps!

Take the [Server] webpages entry out of defaults.cfg.  Put it in
basehost.cfg if you want to set the default.

This is a known bug already on our bug list.

Huh?  If they started off on different ports, I can't see how that could
come about.  And if they didn't start off on different ports, then one
of them should have refused to start because it couldn't answer the
request.

I suspect something else must have been causing the issue that you report.

The @error/text-404.htm is how you get a custom error message.  But only
if the browser is willing to display it.  IE has its own ideas, and by
default displays a "simplified" (read: useless (IMHO)) error message
instead.  Any IE user that wants to see your customised 404 errors will
have to display this feature (called something like "simplified error
messages") in their IE configuration.

I can't see why it shouldn't work providing whatever user you run the
service has, has permission to access the files the hit counter needs.

An example pipedef.xml file got missed out of the 2.5b5 installation
packages, due to an oversight.  Xitami will function without it, so it's
not a major issue.  You can get a copy either from the Xitami 2.5b5
source packages, or via viewcvs from:

http://cvs.imatix.com./cgi-bin/viewcvs/xitami/pipedef.xml

Okay... It shows the hits in the Console but not from the control panel cpl
file.  The control panel is just blank where it says hits but other data is
okay.

It might have something to do with the fact that I've got a bazillion
pipe*.* files in my c:\temp directory...but I really don't know how it
would come about unless Xitami isn't cleaning up after itself or the other
version is assuming that there is only one copy running and the pipe files
are "okay" to write to.

I've done enough socket programming that I have to agree that Xitami
shouldn't have started if they were both trying to get port 80 (it is still
possible to do it, but fairly difficult to achieve).  Since it is extremely
unlikely that this is the case, my guess is that it has something to do
with the pipe files.

BTW, I'm now just using one version of Xitami, so it works fine.  Besides,
this is probably an ancient issue considering the two versions I was trying
to mix :)

Ah ha.  If you've got two things writing to the same temporary directory
using similar file names that could be bad.

We've always said that if you are going to run two instances of Xitami,
you should run them in different directories.  Obviously if you are
using dynamic content this should include different temp directories as
well.

I'm curious about the "bazillion" pipe files though -- which version of
Xitami are you using?  Do you have any debugging options turned on?
(We've had this issue reported before but I thought it had been resolved
providing the debug options were all off -- if the debug options are on,
Xitami keeps them around to assist with debugging.)

Well, I needed SSL capabilities, so I stepped back a couple versions to
Xitami/Pro v2.4c3.  I was trying to combine Xitami v2.4d9 with it (they are
in separate directories), but both seem to want to use c:\temp for
temporary files.

By default the config entry for temp says "temp", which uses the value
of the TEMP environment variable (if present) or the temp directory.
Just override one of them with some other setting.

BTW 2.4c3 is rather old -- handy for a trial run, but not really optimal
for production use.

That's because Xitami 2.4d6 was released before Windows Me was even a
glimmer in Microsoft's eye.  It should work just fine, as Me is
basically Windows 98 warmed over.

That said we'd suggest you use Xitami 2.4d9 (from http://www.xitami.com/)
as it includes some fixes for important bugs.

Check cgierr.log for error messages; it sounds like something is going
wrong during the attempt to run PHP and get things processed.

There's two things that could be generating the 404: Xitami and PHP.
I can't remember off hand if Xitami logs a 404 only when it generates
it, or when that's the code it's going to return (which a CGI/filter can
supply).

Since the request/debug log entries you supply don't match up with the
times in the other snippets you supply, it's hard to know exactly what
is going on.

However I'd definitely suggest (a) looking for messages in cgierr.log,
and (b) adding something to the PHP so you can tell if it is being run.
The fact that Xitami seems to be trying to transfer .flt files (filter
files), suggests that something must have generated those files to
transfer.

You might also want to enable [cgi] debug=1 (which controls filtering
too) and let it preserve the filter files (normally they are removed
after being sent).  Then you can check the contents of those to see if
it is PHP that is writing the 404 error (or indeed if it is writing
anything).

Given that you seem to have a working PHP setup in general (since some
of your other PHP works) I suspect that looking closely at what the
problem PHP script is doing/trying to do has to be your next step.

errors.gsl is basically a template file for what to output, with the
bits in $(....) being values that Xitami has set which you can
substitute into the HTML.  There's a list of which values are available
at the top of the file (in comments).

So essentially you need to edit the HTML in there to match what you
want, using $(...) to put in values that Xitami has from the request
where you want them.

This is just a warning; if you're not using the pipe control feature you

Are you _sure_ you're loading your pages through Xitami?  Both those
problems sound a whole lot like you're just getting IE to load the files
form disk -- in which case it's no surprise that Xitami isn't doing any
SSI translation: no one is asking Xitami to do so.

You should be using a URL like:

http://localhost/

when you are testing.  Not one file file:///.....

The file:///.... one would have problems with image urls like "/image/...";
but Xitami would definitely find them in the default configuration with
a url like that.  This would also explain your empty access.log, and
empty debug.log.

Subject: [Xitami] RE: POST troubles (longish)
Message-ID: <01C10E1F.0F9877F0.boyan@sanbolic.com>

Thanks for the tips. I've found and worked around the problem, now the 
question is if it is a bug in Xitami or some misunderstanding by the 
developer of dcl.
On login, dcl sends user name, password and so on to login.php3.
login.php3 in turn calls its own function Refresh(). This function is used 
to redirect the server to a new file - main.php3 or listFrame.php3, 
depending on your choice of frames or not.
The Refresh() function can use two types of redirect - through the php 
Header() function or through html meta tags.
The relevant part is:
		if ($GLOBALS['cookieMethod'] == 'header')
		{
			$hdr = '';
			if ($GLOBALS['redirMethod'] == 'php')
				$hdr = "Location: $toHere\n";

			$hdr .= "Set-Cookie: DCLINFO=$theCookie\n";
			$hdr .= "Set-Cookie: DCLTYPEMENU=$DCLUI\n";
			$hdr .= "\r\n";

			Header($hdr);
			if (substr($toHere, 0, 10) == 'index.php3')
				exit;
		}
<snip some code>
		print('<html><head>');
<snip a little more>	
		print("<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"00;URL=$toHere\">");
		print('</head>');
<and snip till end of function>

In the non-working configuration I have $redirMethod=="php" and 
$cookieMethod=="header"
In the working configuration the $redirMethod is set to "meta".
In both cases the $toHere variable gets the value 
"main.php3?menuAction=boMyDCL.show" (actually, the php3 filename depends on 
the type of the interface, but this is not important here). Unfortunately, 
it is hard-coded: Refresh('main.php3?menuAction=boMyDCL.show', $id, 
$thispwd, $GLOBALS['DCLUI'], $GLOBALS['LANG'], $GLOBALS['DOMAIN']);

In the non-working case the generated output is (from *.flt):
X-Powered-By: PHP/4.0.4
Location: main.php3?menuAction=boMyDCL.show
Set-Cookie: DCLINFO=1/0/dfe2c07de313f0d7ca27146e068767f1/en/default
Set-Cookie: DCLTYPEMENU=0
Content-type: text/html

<html><head><meta http-equiv="refresh" 
content="00;URL=main.php3?menuAction=boMyDCL.show"></head>



In the working case ($redirMethod=="meta") the generated output is:
X-Powered-By: PHP/4.0.4
Set-Cookie: DCLINFO=1/0/dfe2c07de313f0d7ca27146e068767f1/en/default
Set-Cookie: DCLTYPEMENU=0
Content-type: text/html

<html><head><meta http-equiv="refresh" 
content="00;URL=main.php3?menuAction=boMyDCL.show"></head>


As you can see, the difference is in the "Location:" header. The obvious 
reason is that Xitami can't find the file specified in the Location header 
and returns 404.
Now the question is if this is a bug or a feature. According to HTML 1.1 
definition from 
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30:
"The field value consists of a single absolute URI.
       Location       = "Location" ":" absoluteURI  "
In this case the URI is definitely not an absolute one. So if this is the 
reason for the 404 error, I guess it's OK, although other users seem to be 
using this dcl software just fine. On the other hand, if for some reason 
Xitami tries, but cannot parse the "Location:" field, then it is a bug.

Thanks again,
Boyan

Each surfer can un-default IE to show "unfriendly" error messages. Of
course you can't expect strangers to do that. 

There was a report here that if your 404 error message was big, more
than 1 or 2 kilobytes, IE might show it instead of its "friendly"
message.

Whilst such an attitude might be condoned in an end-user, those designing
any web site ought to be conducting testing with at least Netscape (in
addition to IE).  If they're thorough, they ought to try some other
browsers as well, such as Opera, with a text-only browser (such as Lynx)
also used, especially for checking accessibility to the disabled (such as
those using screen-reader software).

"Designing" for IE alone is preventing half the world from having the
hope to see your site.

So even if you personally don't use Netscape whilst "surfing" yourself,
you should at least see how it (mis)behaves with your own site.

Don't forget Xitami has an inbuilt feature to enable simple testing out for error messages - copied from the documentation it is:-

To test a specific error, you can use the special URL 'error?xxx'. For instance, to simulate a 402 error (Payment Required), use a URL like this: 

'http://127.0.0.1/error?402'. 

You can simulate a 302 error (temporary redirection) using a URL like this: 'http://127.0.0.1/error?302:/somedir/somepage.htm'.

Works for me on Win98se and with IE4 and Netscape and I get my custom error messages with header and footer complete with graphics.

Are you doing site redirection
  (Location: http://wwww.someoffsiteaddress.com/somedir/index.html)
or local redirection (Location: /myonsitedir/index.html)?

If you are doing local redirection then I highly recommend using XiFusion
v2.5 as it will do both absolute (/myonsitedir/index.html) and relative
(../myonsitedir/index.html) local redirection on the server end of things.
Instead of passing the information constantly between the browser, Xitami
webserver, and your scripts, XiFusion will cut out the unnecessary
redirections (and add functionality for relative local redirections).
Granted, XiFusion is designed primarily for ColdFusion, but it will also
work with PHP (officially) and Perl (unofficially).  (XiFusion is available
for both Linux and Windows 9x/NT).

If you are performing site redirection, then it is the browser's
responsibility and XiFusion won't help your situation any.

XiFusion v2.5 can be obtained from:  <http://www.shininglightpro.com/>.
  Click Products->Intel x86->XiFusion to get to the information and
download page.

Hope this helps!

i have no problem redirecting with location from perl in ie and have used
many versions of xitami so perhaps an example of your code is what is needed

Subject: [Xitami] referer field
Message-ID: <3B564054.30802@freesbee.fr>

I recently visited a website where they cunningly used the referer field 
and redirection of it was not present/not suitable to  provide a certain 
amount of security within the site without SSL or any other security 
scehme. This seemed really cool.

Is there a way to do the same thing in Xitami?
What you want to do is only display certain pages if HTTP_REFERER is set 
to an appropriate value otherwise do a redirect to the login page.

I can clearly do this in with CGI pages but I don't think I can do it 
for non CGI pages?

Any ideas

It's fairly weak "security".  Anyone can set the referer field to
anything they want (or not set it) when making a request.  Also some
firewalls and web proxies remove the referer field, which could make it
impossible for some visitors to reach some parts of your website.  In
short: be careful what you apply this technique to.

As you note, you can do this with CGIs.  You can also do it with Filters
AFAIK, as Xitami treats them basically like filters when it comes to
processing things.  And of course you can do it with LRWPs. 

But you can't do it just with plain HTML files at present.

Message-ID: <20010720234924.24612.qmail@web10905.mail.yahoo.com>

I just got a cable modem and now Xitami can't see the
ip address.  The web server is a client machine on the
lan, not the server machine(were the modem is
connected).  Xitami only sees the client machines ip,
not the cable modems permanent ip address.  Is there a
way to redirect the modem ip to Xitami on the client machine?

That's because it's on a different machine :-)

Your cable modem may support this feature; have a look in its
configuration menus.  It's usually called a "pinhole" or "port forwarding".

2.5b1 is NOT the latest service version; it's an old beta version.
2.4d9 is the latest release version of Xitami.  2.5b5 is the latest beta
version.

"2.5b1" has some known bugs so you might want to at least try 2.5b5
(which also has some known bugs, but fewer/different from 2.5b5).

As a start try turning on CGI debugging ([CGI] debug=1), and have a look
at the .cgi and .cgo files.

Ah.  That one is more of a problem, because the control panel in NT runs
in a separate memory space from the webserver (unlike the GUI console
version where it's all part of the same program).

So the answer to "will it work" is "not easily", alas.

Hey Mike....are you sharing your cable modem across several computers?
such as the LInkSys routers (etc). What you're gonna need to do is bind
the IP address to the machine you wish to be the server and then use
some sort of sharing software (www.internetshare.com) and use the web
server for a Internet Sharing server as well....

I'm not sure what you're asking. Do you want the Web server on the Internet?
If so, you can use a Linksys Router and forward the port to the Web server
using the router software.

     I use a device like the Linksys router.  Mine is the CNIG904B from
CNET.  It is connected to my cable modem then their are four computers
plugged into the CNIG904B.  There's no Internet sharing software required.
The router takes care of everything.  For setup just plug a computer into
the CNIG904B and with your browser go to: http://192.168.1.1,  Fill out the
form you'll get for that particular machine.  One of the questions on the
form is asking if you want this particular computer to get it's IP address
automatically or do you want it to be assigned?  I have three of my
computers set to get it automatically and one set to it it assigned.  The
one that has it assigned is my Xitami server machine and I believe for a
server an assigned IP address is required.  The IP address I assigned it has
to be one of 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.4, I believe.  When traffic flows
between any of the four computers and the cable modem the router knows what
machine it came from and is going to.

Subject: [Xitami] CGI set up problem
Message-ID: <15OGBI-0zAYWuC@fmrl07.sul.t-online.com>

Hello all,
I'm currently running xitami and php on a win2k machine to test some
websites I am developing and everything so far has worked fine and
without problem.

Now I needed to do something which requires a CGI (a perl script)
solution and I am wondering what to do here ... I can call up the
testcgi.exe file provided with Xitami via the URL localhost at
127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe which puts out various system information
correctly and as such CGI seems to work.  But, I cannot call the
testcgi.pl file ... then I get an error message.

Question: Do I need something else first here to run CGI scripts which
are in perl? Where could I get what I need and where do I install it on
this win2k machine? I am not all that "techno expert" here ... (as you
probably guessed because I am even asking the question), but sure would
like to have my xitami installation run cgi scripts on those websites I
am working on which I have set up as virtual hosts ... 

Any help is very much appreciated. Thanks!

God bless you with His grace and peace

Do you have Perl installed? If not, go to www.activeperl.com and download
ActivePerl for Windows.

Hello Owen, and others

thanks for the note ... in the meantime I went to the site and
downloaded and installed the activeperl on my PC ... its test script
ran without problem and also the localhost/cgi-bin/testperl.pl script
described in the xitami help section.

Should I now put any cgi scripts / perl scripts into the cgi-bin
directory of the xitami folder ?  I'd rather put them in to their own
cgi-bin directory if the respective virutal host's webpages folder ... 
but I am not sure if I understand the various comments about CGI in the
Help info correctly ... anything you would suggest (in simple words)?
Thanks for being patient with me and helping me (a novice to webserver
stuff) along here ...

God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang

It's possible to specify a custom cgi-bin for each virtual host in the
web-based admin. Also, depending on the way you set up Xitami, if "cgi-bin"
is in the URL, it will run.

Hello,

there are some cgi as well as php files which deal with handling of

simple way of adding a mail server or something to Xitami so I can test
those functions locally as well ...?

Hi Owen,
just copied the test perl file into a cgi-bin folder of a virutal host
and called it up ... everything is fine and works! Thanks for your kind
help and pointing me in the right direction ...!

Try the "1st Class Mailserver" (http://www.1cis.com).  It sticks a fairly
non-intrusive footer onto all outgoing messages and is extremely easy to
set up.  However, I've never been able to figure out how to bring it down
without rebooting.  It consumes a very small amount of memory, and is
fairly fast.  There are other mailservers out there, but they take a while
to set up and not all are free.  Beware, the shareware version of 1cis is
SPAM-prone and offers no protection from outsiders.  If you want a more
permanent solution, then I recommend trying EzMTS (www.ezmts.org - the
freeware version).  You still need some CGI-based solution to actually talk
to the mail server, but at least you would have a test server to work with.

You might want to set up sendmail for windows or what
ever you have they make sendmail for All OS's from
unix to NT to 98 to ME 
Its easy to install and works for me that is here is a
link for a windows based verson other wise you will
have to search for it on http://www.freedownloads.com
The windows verson is

I had the same problem with that you need to set up
Xitami on the computer that is directly hooked up the
the ethernet cable from your cable box.  Other wise
you will have to buy a router and talk to your ISP

Message-ID: <JBEBLMMBAAIAEILFEPDIEEAGCBAA.flare_storm@yahoo.com>

Hi, sorry if this is a newbie question, but I'm a newbie:

I want to move my cgi-bin directory to a completely different part of my
hard drive.  I have tried changing the cgi option in the console and
defaults.cfg to c:\dir with spaces\folder\cgi-bin.  But the testcgi program
gives a page with "Cannot create cgi process - program not found" .  When I
put everything back to the defaults, testcgi works fine.    I've made sure
the path exists and restarted the server, but nothing seems to work.   The
manual says:

"cgi-bin: specifies the directory where cgi programs are located. this can
be an absolute directory (starting with '/' or '\', if you prefer) or a
relative directory (not starting with '/' or '\'). "

I'm confused on the "starting with a '/' or '\'" part.  Thanks for any help

Uhh, no... All he needs is the router and one static IP for the outside world
to see. 

The router will take care of making sure the correct machine (any designated
machine on the LAN) gets the traffic, provided the port forwards are set up
correctly.

Dear Thomas,

I downloaded the above utility ... and ran the install routine ... but
now I am a bit at a loss as to what I need to do next to somehow
"connect" things ... :-(   Or does this "mailserver" really have
nothing to do with the "xitami webserver" ?  

Sorry if I am bothering some on this list by such perhaps very "silly
sounding" questions ...  I am just not an expert at these things  ... 
but a willing "amateur" learner if someone is willing to teach me and
coach me along the trail here  Hi everyone,

I have installed Xitami webserver on my Win2k machine and also php
module as well as CGI functions (via Active Perl) so I can "testdrive"
websites I am working on without having to upload files to a "real"
server and testing them from there ...
Any helpful input and assistance is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang

As the author of the email server that you just downloaded I would be MORE

But please do so in direct email, we don't need to clutter the Xitami list

Try a directory without spaces. MS's implementation of spacy file/folder
names is pretty erratic. 

Or find out what the 8.3 name of your spaced directory is, and use that.

Are you working on the same or different drive letter, CGI and Xitami?
Maybe it's me, but I've had better luck keeping everything Xitami has to
find on the same drive letter as Xitami.

> Or does this "mailserver" really have nothing to do with the "xitami webserver" ?  

Nothing at all to do with the webserver, except the sendmail program
probably should run on the same machine as your scripts. 

Machines can have MANY "servers". HTTP, FTP, mail, time, telnet, DNS,
.....  Xitami combines HTTP and FTP, which is unusual (FTP is far older
than HTTP); for it to add email service would be nice but a bit much. 

The internet, email, and unix grew up together in the same time and
places. So unix machines almost always have a suite of mail services.

Windows grew up un-networked, or with MicroSoft's strange windows-only
mail system, or with clients that did as little as possible to get/send
mail through a real mail server. Also, Windows isn't about command-line
work. So Windows lacks mail tools that most unix boxes have.

The core mail program is a post office, a program to accept, sort,
store, and deliver mail. This generally runs in the background and you
do not talk to it directly. 

To send mail, unix has sendmail, a very simple program to accept a
formatted file and submit it to a post office. The docs for sendmail say
that it isn't made for use by people, a front-end program is needed to
get a nice user interface. But on a script that knows what sendmail
needs, it is the standard way to send mail.

Users on unix systems use mail (a very simple command-line program),
Pine/Elm/etc which are text-mode menu-driven full-screen email managers,
and fancier stuff. Good for people, and you could drive mail with a
script, but overkill for most script work.

There are BIG security risks in running mail services. The biggest is
the post office: traditionally such programs accept mail from strangers
and deliver it anywhere. Spammers love these, because "you" get the
blame for their spam. I would be real wary of some post office from
unknown authors, with mystery options and unknown bugs. Also, older
emailers may not block newly discovered hacker tricks. Craig's program
looks excellent, but read the docs well and be sure to talk to him or
experienced postmasters to be sure your postoffice is secure.

If you just want script-driven mail sending, you may not need your own
post office. Your ISP surely runs a postofffice and should accept email
from machines on internal IP numbers (or with authentication). Configure
sendmail to submit mail through your ISP's post office. I found one for
Windows that can do this, but it is exceptionally hard to set up, and
the usual perl script must be hacked to feed it right. I'll probably
move to a full mail suite the next time this one frustrates me. 

(I'm shocked that there does not seem to be a "universal" sendmail
written directly in Perl. The net::SMTP module has the essentials, and I
have a rough draft working under Windows, but with hard-coded message
headers and body, not in the way sendmail expects.)

Hi Paul,
thank you very much for some good information for me as a "novice" to
these things ... I'm getting a better picture here.

I am trying to find a program I can run on my win2k machine without
being connected to the internet and for testing of certain e-mail
functions in my websites which I am testing ...  so there are no
security issues involved, in that I am solely in a "sandbox by myself"
here ...

Since I am paying by the minute which I am online, I do not have the
luxury of flat rates as in the US and other places perhaps .... thus I
was looking to be able to test websites and their e-mail functions (via
CGI or PHP scripts) while offline right on my Win2k PC /notebook ... Up
til now, I went the above route and uploaded the scripts to one of my
websites at my ISP's server, then tried and tested it with the ISP's
mail server etc ... had to "uninstall" the files again etc ....
headaches .. which I would like to work around with a simple
"mailserver" on my own machine

God bless you with His grace and peace

OH!

You don't need email? You need something to catch what a script sends to
sendmail? 

Create a plain text file, named SENDMAIL.BAT , and put this line in it:

 more >> C:\sentmail.txt

Save SENDMAIL.BAT "someplace". Where? Since most perl scripts using
sendmail assume it is some place like /usr/bin , you could try making a
folder of that name on the same drive as Xitami, and put it there. OR,
put it some place you like and edit your perl scripts to point to it.
Whichever is easier. 

For initial testing, find or make a small text file and copy it to the
same folder as SENDMAIL.BAT. Let's say the text file is called TEST.TXT. 
Open a DOS window and CD to that folder. The command 

  SENDMAIL < TEST.TXT

should run without complaint. Now look for the file C:\sentmail.txt and
open it. Should contain the words in TEST.TXT. Each time you run
SENDMAIL, the text sent through it will be appended to the end of
C:\SENTMAIL.TXT

Then try your scripts. 

I *think* that will emulate enough of a real sendmail to do what you
want.

Hmn ... well I thought I need a mail server since those things are what
normally sends mail to an e-mail address.  And thus far I only thought
of being able to set up an e-mail address such as
info@virtualhost-domain.com and test a form on one of those pages to
send data to that e-mail address ... and I figured I need a mailserver
to process that data to be "received" by that address.   But, you are
right ... I really would probabyl already be fine if I could see that
the script has "sent" the data in form of an e-mail text etc ... be it
to an actual e-mail address account or re-directed to some text file
...

Umm - if  you are creating more than 25 line mail messages I think 
you'll have a stalled program waiting for someone to press enter if you 
do something like you propose.

Not quite sure what the solution is unless you have perl. If you have 
perl then a bat file that invokes perl and then does a file append would 
work for sure.

I thought that but no, you don't have to. Type more at the DOS prompt and
enter a screenfull. You don't have to press ENTER. Only if you do TYPE
WHATEVER | MORE.

Chances are this is because of "\dir with spaces\", and the (poor) way
that Microsoft handles this situation.  We do try to work around this
problem, but it's not 100%.  I'd suggest trying an alternative
directory path _without_ spaces in its name.

Duh - I hadn't thought of that. I just was not thinking of MORE's
main feature (the 25-line pause) at all.

But it seems Owen is right. I just ran 240+ lines through my BAT
file in a single gulp, and all the output showed as soon as I
switched back to my editor (which told me I should reload the
changed file). 

Theory: MORE asks the terminal driver how many lines between
Press Any Key.... 25, 43, 50 lines, it can vary. When run in a
pipe, the answer is "There is no screen size", and apparently
MORE is smart enough (or stupid enough) to pass huge streams
without user intervention.

 ....More testing... I just fed it 34480 lines, 1.1 megabytes.
This takes a couple seconds, and then the output shows up in the
sentmail.txt file. 30K lines+ and a megabyte+ of characters ought
to be enough for most purposes. 

I learned something new. Thanks. 

Owen > if you do TYPE WHATEVER | MORE

I tried TYPE, but sendmail generally expects the body of the
message as a pipe or redirect. I could not remember the syntax to
make TYPE eat STDIN instead of a real file. (DOS ain't unix; and
TYPE predates the semi-unixification of DOS 2.0.) 

Wolfgang, if you are still here... sendmail also generally takes
the TO address and some arcane options on the command line. My
trick will not pass this information. I assume that, since you
aren't really mailing it, you don't need this info while doing
"sandbox by myself" testing. You will check your TO address and
options in the script when you really do set it up for emailing.

Also: the "fake" sendmail dumping to a local text file is faster
than any mail server. True, a local unloaded mailserver can be
faster than your fingers so that may not be important, but the
fake sendmail is probably many microseconds faster. And keeping a
good editor open on the output file is probably faster than
working through a mail reader. Especially on a pay-per-minute
connection.

>OH! > Oooh, Paul!

Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. But I was so excited I
slapped my forehead and said "OH! That's what he needs!"

I was not sure what you were doing, and you were not sure what to
ask, so we had all that talk about mailservers. When it became
clear that you were "testing in a sandbox", and wanted to work
off-line, and real email wasn't needed, I said "OH! There has to
be some super-simple way to do that!" 

You didn't need a mail server, you needed something to pretend to
take mail (in sendmail format) and put it where you could see it.
As long as the script can believe it is feeding to sendmail, it
does not matter what really happens inside "sendmail". DOS isn't
unix so it isn't THAT easy, but certainly a BAT file with MORE is
easier than building a post office. 

If you ever do install a "real" sendmail, hide or rename your
"fake" sendmail so there is no confusion.

You were right.  Moving cgi and configuring it to a dir without spaces
works.  Using a dir with spaces but using the ms-dos dir name didn't work.
Unfortunately, this totally messes up the directory structure I wanted.  :(

Does anyone have any recommendations (tips) when it comes to installing Php
with Xitami? I'm using 2.4c3 Pro and can't get it to work. It either gives
me a CGI error when trying a test .php file or it just gives me a blank
page.

What version of PHP? What version of Xitami, Windows?

Did you manually setup the Filters section of Xitami?

Did you edit the php.ini file (if Windows)?

Let me know, and I will see what I can do to help.

FASCINATING. I learn something about a program after using it for 15 
YEARS and countless versions of DOS/Windows. WOW!!!

Check cgierr.log.

I strongly suspect you don't actually have a c:\php _program_ for Xitami
to run (which is what you're telling it to run) and that's the problem.

You need to point the filter at the _program_ doing the filtering, not
just a directory that might happen to contain it somewhere.

hi i recently had to install php for one of my users, and knowing nothing
about it, went to the php site and found an installer file for php4

reading the info it said it worked for win with iis pws and xitami

of course i downloaded it and ran it but there was nothing in xitami

this turned out to be because i had a version that was running in the xiwin
dir and the new versions all run in the xitami dir

i downloaded the upgrade installed restarted and reinstalled php and it just
worked.

the file i downloaded was called php-4.0.3pl1-installer.exe

try it, you will all like it. and it will save you so much time posting
here.

for those not using xitami running from the xitami dir be aware that in
doing my upgrade i lost ssi and had to upgrade to the latest version to get
it back.

XiFusion will work with that version of Xitami, but requires another
wrapper for it to work correctly.  I'm experimenting with that particular
version of Pro as well, so here is a Perl wrapper for you to use (Requires
Perl, PHP, and XiFusion):

#!c:/perl/bin/perl

$ENV{"PATH_TRANSLATED"} = $ENV{"DOCUMENT_ROOT"}.$ENV{"SCRIPT_NAME"};
# You might need to modify the following line:
system "c:\\xifusion\\xifusion.exe c:\\php4\\php.exe";


In the Filters section, use something like this:
  .php=c:\perl\bin\perl c:\progra~1\xitamipro\nvmlwrap.pl

I know it isn't pretty, but it works.

Hope that helps!

Hm, i miss one important addon on this page, PHP for OS/2 as standalone 
module (executable).

I have been using this for some time now, with Xitami, and it performs 
quite well. (Appears to be faster than Perl CGI scripts!) 

You can find info + downloads here: http://www.apache.org/~bjh/php/

Thanks,

Joachim.

Dear Rich,

I have a win2k (formerly a Win98) system with Xitami and PHP running
very well and without trouble.

(1) Installed PHP for Win (download install file from www.php.net) in
      the "normal" directory c:\php

(2) In Xitami, I then edited the {Filters] section in the *.cfg files
for 
      the virutal hosts and defaults.cfg as follows:

     [Filter]
    .php=c:\php\php.exe
    .php3=c:\php\php.exe
    .phtml=c:\php\php.exe 

After that, I could call up any domain (virtual host) and use php files
with the above file extensions and they run without any trouble or
error messages.
(of course, the domains / virtual hosts need to be entered in the Win
HOSTS file to be recognized with "localhost"

God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang

I've had that problem on a couple of systems and it's very annoying!
However, I got it to work by:

1) Installing PHP to C:\PHP (it shouldn't matter where it is installed)
2) Copying PHP.EXE and PHP4TS.DLL to the Xitami directory
3) Adding:

.php=php.exe
.php3=php.exe

to the [Filter] section of the appropriate CFG file.

People, you have to pay attention to the version of Xitami this guy is
using.  It has NOTHING to do with PHP!  Instead, it is how the CGI/Filter
environment is set up before running PHP.  The version he is using creates
a slightly different environment compared to the latest builds of Xitami
thus causing PHP to not work.

Hi Richard,

I've only used Xitami versions 2.4d7 and just recently on my notebook I
installed 2.5b4 ...

If you can't get things to work with PHP and the filer settings etc.
perhaps you should update your Xitami version to a more recent release
?  I wonder if perhaps the reason is in how the older Xitami version is
handling some things  ??   

But that's only a "fishing in unknown waters" here .... just a thought,
perhaps a "revelation" ?
God bless you with His grace and peace

On DOS-based machines, a BAT file can do the same and probably with less
overhead. Launching an instance of Perl needs a couple megs of RAM; an
instance of COMMAND (or CMD) to process a BAT file is under 64K. 

I doubt there is a practical difference unless you run a P-133 with
32Megs, as I was doing until this week.

Thanks, I will take note of this.  I know the Perl interpreter consumes a
lot of resources, but I needed something quick and easy.  However, I don't
notice much of a difference anymore since I use a Dual PIII 500 machine
with 384MB RAM.  I used to use a 486 DX2/66 with 8MB RAM.

Read my previous e-mail on the subject.  It went something like:  Use PHP,
a Perl wrapper (of which I posted source to), and XiFusion.  Someone noted
that I could have used a batch file instead, converting the code isn't that
difficult, I just had a similar situation and solved it quickly (an hour or
so) and easily with a bit of Perl and XiFusion.

Thanks.  You came very close to being removed from the list, and
possibly banned from it: mail configuration errors that send their error
messages back to the list are very bad, and ones that then process their
own input (ie, feeding on their own problems) are very very bad.

(For those wondering I was doing little things like sleeping, which is
why it didn't get removed earlier.  Sorry for the inconvenience.)

Anyway planning on forwarding messages from the mailing list somewhere
should be _very_ careful to test it properly, and monitor it in case
something goes wrong.  And very very careful that it doesn't send error
messages back to the mailing list, or people who post to thel list.

Message-ID: <3B604164.50211026@dtbakerprojects.com>

something I've been wondering for a while.... Sometimes when I request a
page that is on my //localhost, the browser takes several (2-10) seconds
to get a reply, but other times it is really speedy.

Is there something in my configuration of xitami or networking control
panel that I can check to help my machine find localhost quickly all the
time? My internet connection is thru @home which has no gateway defined,
no DNS (they use DCHP enabled), dynamic IP addresses and the like.
additionally, I just added a dlink 713p wireless router/firewall so I
can share my connection between two home computers and have home file
sharing.

I am running a localhost on a win98 machine for some local utility
pages. 

thanx,

Hi:

As some of you may have noticed, I placed an "request for help" in 
this forum for help with SSI.  I did obtain some help from one person 
but it did not resolve my problem.

I have reviewed several SSI tutorials from the net but although the 
set command is not described very often, from the few that I found 
that described its use, it would appear that I am using it correctly.  I 
am wondering if Xitami's implementation of SSI is either deficient or 
has a bug in it.

If I setup a link as follows:

template.shtml?bodytext1.txt

I can display the text after the question mark with the following:

<!--#echo var="QUERY_STRING" -->

However, I want the QUERY_STRING text, in this case a filename, to 
be the virtual filename as follows:

<!--#include virtual="QUERY_STRING" -->

but I get nothing.  I have changed virtual to file but to no avail.  I 
have used both absolute and relative paths and again, no success.

When my instructor for my webmaster course showed us this trick, 
he used a slightly different procedure whereby he "set" the contents 
of a variable to be the QUERY_STRING as follows:

<!--#set var="bodycontentfile" value="$QUERY_STRING" -->

but when I try this using Xitami, I get an error that states:

[xitami SSI: Can't open ssi file 
O:/XITAMI/webpages/cuac/public_html/$QUERY_STRING]

Any suggestions?

Dear All,

load php files that use URL arguments.  I did find a variable passargs

?>.  In checking the debug files, it does seem to find and read the
file, but it's output size is 0.  I tried to parse it via the command
line, but got nothing.  I also tried
http://localhost/fw/menu.php?menu=1&submenu=0, but it did not work.

Do I need go back to an old version and pray that my hosting company
does not upgrade soon or ??

If you want to use relative 'Location:' headers like you have above, you
will need to use XiFusion as Xitami (latest stable release) does not
support server-side redirection, thus the 'Location:' must either be
absolute (header("Location: /fw/menu.php?menu=1&submenu=0");) OR you use
XiFusion as it will handle the server-side redirections (both relative and
absolute) correctly.

>file, but it's output size is 0.  I tried to parse it via the command

XiFusion will always guarantee at least 1 byte of HTML output...that way
IE/Netscape/etc. does not "hang" waiting for a page to return.

>line, but got nothing.  I also tried
>http://localhost/fw/menu.php?menu=1&submenu=0, but it did not work.

That's odd.  What exactly happened when you ran that script (logfile data,
debug info., etc.)?

Hi!

Maybe someone can help me to solve this...

I have an office environment with a workstation and a separate 
webserver (running apache currently).

I am attempting to replicate this in a mobile environment all on one 
laptop, in such a way that the code will copy over and run without 
modification.

I have an entry in the laptop's hosts file which redirects the DNS 
name of the real webserver to 127.0.0.1 and this works. However, 
when I try to configure Xitami to unconditionally accept PUT 
requests (I'm happy that secuirty is not an issue because there is 
no network connection, but I don;t want to have to authenticate...!) I 
get a 403 error for every attempt to PUT a file...

Any thoughts as to where my probelm lies woudl be gratefully 
received!

Yours,

Hi:

Although no one has yet answered my question, "Is Xitami's SSI 
implimentation buggy or incomplete?", I have determined that, for 
whatever reason, Xitami won't or can't impliment SSI's #set command 
but the same code works under Apache 1.3.20.

I would have liked to continue to use Xitami as my localhost website 
testing platform but with this deficiency or defect, I will have to 
switch to Apache.

I recognize that Apache also is not the be-all and end-all of 
webserver software too but for now, it works for me.

Are we talking 2.4 or 2.5?

2.4's SSI is stated to be incomplete, but is just a Perl script which
you could edit to add any feature you need. 

> I have reviewed several SSI tutorials from the net... the set command is not described very often,

I'm no SSI expert, but is it possible that SSI set is something invented
by Apache? Considering Apache's dominance in the webserver world,
tutorials may not bother to mention if something works only on Apache. 

For what it's worth: "set" is NOT documented on the NCSA site's SSI
page, the birthplace of CGI and SSI. 

http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/includes.html

The NCSA site is referenced in Xitami 2.4's docs at /xitami/INDEX6.HTM,
which does not list "set" but adds: "With a small knowledge of Perl, you
can easily modify the Perlssi filter to add support for other tags." 

Obviously if you don't want to hack some Perl, and nobody here has a
pre-tested PerlSSI "set" modification you can use, that's no use. 

Xitami 2.5 has in-built SSI, which I have not looked at. If "set" really
is a commonly used extension of SSI, maybe Ewen should know. 

> I recognize that Apache also is not the be-all and end-all of

Well, but it IS the dominant server by a good margin. Each of us has our
own reasons for picking a server; I'd say that a need for 99.99% Apache
compatibility is a good reason to use Apache. They have ports to most
platforms. All free. 

They say the Windows port may be unstable, but it appears to be as
stable as anything on Windows can be. I think they disclaim it just so
they don't tarnish the reliability reputation Apache has running on
clean unix boxes. Certainly WinApache should be stable enough for hard
development duty. And it isn't significantly bigger than Xitami; the
main drawback is arcane configuration files to edit. But I had the
basics working pretty easy.

AFAIK the #set command is an Apache extension; if you require that
Apache extension then I guess you'll have to use Apache :-)

There has been some discussion about extending the Xitami SSI handler
(which is based on the NCSA include facility; Apache was originally
based on the NCSA code too), in particular extending it to support some
of the common Apache and other extensions, but this has not happened.

As always we welcome someone taking the time to write the code to handle
the extensions.

Xitami's SSI is not Apache's extended SSI.  If you call that
"incomplete" then I guess it's "incomplete".  But it never claimed to be
an implementation of the Apache extended SSI.

That is becuase you ask for a file called "QUERY_STRING" to be included;
probably you don't have one.

As far as I know variable interpolation is also an extension to the
SSI processing, and as such it's not supported by Xitami.

As I said in another message, if you need extensions that are
implemented only in one webserver, then, well, you'll need to use that
webserver.

Offers to implement these extensions for Xitami are always welcome.

It is best to send these message to the Xitami support list,
xitami@lists.xitami.org.

Without more information, it's hard to say what is going wrong.  But you
could check you really are downloading the file through Xitami
(http://localhost/.....), and that the file is in the cgi-bin directory
(http://localhost/cgi-bin/....).   Otherwise it won't get run, and will
just be sent to your browser instead.

Are you typing '//localhost' into the browser?  If so, then you should note
that it might be looking for a machine called 'localhost' using the NetBIOS
protocol (hence the really long delays).  Try the fully qualified
'http://localhost/' URL instead.  Also try 'http://127.0.0.1/' as well.

Also, I don't see how you get out onto other servers if you don't have a
gateway defined.  I'll bet a gateway shows up if you run 'winipcfg' and
select your network card.  I would even bet you have DNS as well.  DHCP is
just a protocol to set up gateway, IP address, DNS server list, WINS, etc.
information.  DHCP just makes all of that transparent to you, but it can
come in quite handy at times to know that information.

Look for a file called HOSTS on your system, under Win98 it should be located
in your C:\Windows\system32 directory (I think, its been a while for me under
Win9x). There is a sample file called HOSTS.SAM that is an example file for
HOSTS if you don't have it there already. 

At any rate, add the following line to your HOSTS file:

127.0.0.1	localhost

HOSTS is always checked first by Windows when it is trying to resolve
hostnames. That should help you.

good idea, but the line already was in there... maybe added by the
xitami install?

you're the winner Thomas... I checked my bookmarks, and they were indeed
entered as localhost/whatever. I changed to http://localhost/whatever,
and it seems to blaze right thru every time.

-------
yes DHCP does go out and set all that up. I was just trying to give the
parameters of how my protocols are set up. The DHCP sets the
router/firewall as a local gateway 192.168.0.1 and goes out and gets the
DNS and assigned IP address from @home. 

thanx for your help!!

That file is extracted from the Windows archives (CAB files) when you first
install Windows.  Xitami doesn't touch it.

Not sure what the problem here is - perhaps you could explain in more
detail as to what steps you have taken so far.

I think you mean ColdFusion ('cfusion\bin') when you say 'xifusion\bin'.
Remember that XiFusion is designed primarily for ColdFusion, but will also
work with PHP.  ColdFusion installs in the 'c:\cfusion' directory by
default.  XiFusion doesn't care where it is as it is a self-contained
executable (you could put it in c:\program files\myfavoritegames and it
won't care as long as it is someplace on your hard drive).

I interleaved PHP notes in with the ColdFusion installation information
since PHP is officially supported, but it isn't the primary/original use of
XiFusion.  You just need to pay some attention to the ColdFusion notes as
they will help to set up PHP, but don't follow every word since the PHP
notes are there to help set up PHP correctly.

Provide more details as to what you have so far (Filters section and the
location of XiFusion as well as the location of PHP) and I'll see what went
wrong and fix it.

I am running xitami version 2.4d9 on windows98 with mysql and php. After
installing xitami, the perlinstaller and mysql i get  the message that some
php-files could not be located on my server. I am however very sure the are
where they should be. In the xitami archieves i found some messages that it
could be that passing unfilled variables could cause this and that xifusion
solved the problem. So i downloaded xifusion.zip.

In the readme file in this zip, is said that during the installationprocess
a xifusion\bin dir is created with a program, later needed in the
installationprocess of xifusion.

I located a testje.php at my server with the php-onfo command at
http://213.93.84.95/testje.php

I hope you have enough info now to help me solve my problem....

You are referring to the lines that say:
PHP NOTE:  The line in the [Filter] section should look like this:
           .php=c:\cfusion\bin\XiFusion c:\php\php.exe

I assumed that XiFusion was installed in the c:\cfusion\bin directory when
I wrote the documentation.  You have to *manually* extract XiFusion.exe and
put it into a directory somewhere on your hard drive and replace
'c:\cfusion\bin' with the drive and directory where you put the XiFusion
executable (XiFusion.exe).  Note that there is NO fancy install program as
there is really only one necessary file and a 1MB installation program is
hardly necessary for a 65K executable.

BTW, this format of documentation is quite standard for DOS/Console
programs.  DOS is simple to use, but you have to know to translate path
names/drive letters in your head when reading readme.txt files since no two
computer systems are set up exactly the same.  XiFusion is really a Win32
Console mode program, thus I wrote the documentation using DOS
documentation standards in mind.

Also, when you start to work with web servers and interfacing CGI
applications (which is what PHP and ColdFusion really are), knowledge of
how to use DOS comes in quite handy.

What do the log files say?  (The log files are your friend :)

I had the same effect if I loaded the phpinfo() from an alias,
loading it from behind Xitami's www server root was ok.
(NT 4 (SP6a,Security Rollup Package) + Xitami 2.5b4 application + PHP 4.0.6
+ IE 5.5 SP1)

Aliases, and filters (if that's how you're using PHP; CGIs for that
matter) do not mix together very well. You're better off using some
other approach (eg, virtual hosts) to handle the virtual directories if
you need to use PHP/CGI with them.

This is normal, although it seems that your files are being rotated
fairly often.  Basically this message is from xisuper, the "supervisor"
of Xitami, and it is expiring old log files which are older than the
expiry time that you've sent.

Curiously it seems to be expiring two of them per hour, which suggests
that your log files (or at least one of two of them) are being rolled
over hourly.  That seems a little often to be rolling over the log files
to me; I tend to use weekly, or daily on busy sites.

But no, it's not someone breaking in.

Hi,

Hope you don't might that I emailed you. I also have the Cisco 1720 router, but I can't seem to configure it at all. This is what I did, but I can't get my PC to go to the web...

This is what I got from my internet provider....

IP: 24.177.67.129
Submask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 24.177.67.1

The router came with a build-in 10/100 Ethernet card and WAN (WIC-ENET) card which is plugged into WIC-0.

I configured the 10/100 Ethernet end to point to my local LAN (ip - 10.10.10.1), and ethenet0 to point to the outside network (cable-modem.....IP = 24.177.67.129)......

I have a private LAN with the following IP range: 10.10.10.0 --- 10.10.10.254
I configured the router using configmaker, but it is not working. From my PC on the network, I was able to ping both ends (both Ethernet) of the router Ethernet card or address....But I can't seem to go out using my internet. I do notice that when I was configuring on end of my router to point to the internet, I don't see any where in there that I can set the Gateway information....without it, how do the router know where to send the outside ip to....

Attach is the configure file...
 <<router.net>> 
Please help. Your help will be very much appreciated.

Thanks.
