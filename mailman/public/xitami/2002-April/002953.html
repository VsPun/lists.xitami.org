</I>
They are, and they come from within your ISP, but probably not
&quot;from&quot; your ISP. The IP number translates to a hostname that looks a
lot like the one you sent this email from.

 &gt; host 24.128.72.232
232.72.128.24.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer h00c0f03820eb.ne.client2.attbi.com

 &gt; host 24.128.19.74
 74.19.128.24.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer h00a0cc58ab25.ne.client2.attbi.com

What are they doing?

 &quot;GET /scripts/..%c1%9c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir

This requested URL is &quot;malformed&quot;. The dots and percents aren't
right. Xitami properly notices that, and replies 404 or 403
depending on just where it decides that this is meaningless.

However, MS IIS webserver is tricked into navigating up out of the
webpages folder, into the root, down into the windows system folder,
and runs CMD, the command processor! (Some call it the &quot;DOS box&quot;.)

This involves two very stupid mistakes by MS IIS's programmers.
Malformed URLs should be rejected, and files outside those folder
specifically designated for web-serving should never be served. You
could say that running a program not designated for CGI delivery is
also a mistake, though MS IIS's notion of CGI is pretty elaborate,
supporting MS-proprietary extensions that basically sell MS
programming languages.

In this case, they request a DIR from CMD. On Xitami and patched
IIS, the response is &quot;error&quot;, they ignore it. If the response is a
list of files, they struck gold. They can put more clever commands
into CMD and do almost anything to your machine.

You may wonder why they are trying IIS hacks on your Xitami server.
Well, IIS is the second most common webserver, and THE most common
inside home-ISP networks. Many folks have IIS running and don't even
know it. And it is just plain easier to try a IIS-hack on every
machine than to actually check which ones are IIS. Typically, the
script contacts -every- IP number in a given range, whether or not
there is a webserver there. If no server, it times-out. If a &quot;good&quot;
webserver, it ignores these silly requests. But unpatched IIS will
do the wrong thing quickly and efficiently.

This isn't a DoS attack. CMD..DIR just asks for a list of files. If
they can do that, they can ask CMD to install software that could
start flooding other machines to jam them. But that's not seen here.

You could report that IP number to your ISP. It is barely possible
that your ISP is doing it: my net-admins do a similar (but better!)
scan every month and inform anybody hosting a vulnerable machine.
More likely it is some kid reading hacker-sites and trying the most
basic hack-scripts. If the ISP cares, they will warn the account
holder and the kid may be sent to bed without supper. But there is
always another kid.

It does you no harm, except a slight increase in log-file size. When
CodeRed was popular, my logs were 10% real hits and 90% CodeRed
errors. In the peak-week, it actually was a mild problem: my slow
machine was bogged on logs, and I had to take it down for 10 minutes
and delete some monster files. CodeRed and Samba are different: they
use a VERY long request URL (thousands of characters) to overflow
IIS's request buffer and inject malicious code into IIS. Again,
Xitami handles this correctly: no overflow, just an error and huge
log files.

&gt;<i>  Perl.exe mysteriously disappeared from my machine recently.
</I>
Odd. But not something a hacker would want to do.
