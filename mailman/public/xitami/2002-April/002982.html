I tried both and I had an easy time with SSI on both.  Sambar 
caused me other serious problems esp on my NT ~ like quietly 
crashing on a regular basis.  If Sambar has improved lately - it 
really had to.

Otoh, Sambar has real strengths.  Ssi include statements do 
include much larger texts than Xitami.  What the limit is I have no 
idea.  And, while I don't use it much, Sambar handles ASP much 
better.  Their admin is nice.

If it didn't crash so often I'd be a real Sambar fan.
