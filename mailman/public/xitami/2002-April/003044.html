<PRE>i occasionally have had the same problem. i run about 4 xitami servers and
have seen it on 2 of them. both were corrected when i had to reinstall the
machines.... so i never found a fix. the log file never gets created - so
you get that error everyday and eventually have a very long log file. it
just starts happening one day out of the blue. if you shut down xitami, you
can manually rename the log file and a new one will be created when you
restart xitami. but you will continue to get the same error.

if anyone knows how to fix this....

(ps - i'm currently running versions 2.4d6 and 2.4d9)

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have had this problem a long time ago, while running Xitami application
</I>&gt;<i> (not the service) on NT4.
</I>&gt;<i> After switching to the Xitami service 2.4d9 everything worked fine.
</I>&gt;<i> Recently I upgraded to Xitami Pro 2.4d10 and experience a few snags.
</I>&gt;<i> One of them is that the logs do not get renamed in the log folder and I
</I>get
&gt;<i> in the xitami.log an error like this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2/04/23  0:00:12: Could not rename 'logs\access.log' to
</I>'logs\ac020423.log'
&gt;<i> 2/04/23  0:00:12: Permission denied
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've noticed that the configuration files of Xitami Pro 2.4d10, although I
</I>&gt;<i> believed at least updated to 2.4d9, they were not. For example, there were
</I>&gt;<i> no LRWP 2.0 protocol entries. Also I noticed that the help HTML files were
</I>&gt;<i> just copied from 2.4d7 without even changing the version number. Not very
</I>&gt;<i> nice for a product that is not free anymore, but anyway, other than this I
</I>&gt;<i> am happy with the overall functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there might be some setting that I missed and I wonder if
</I>anybody
&gt;<i> else ran into this and solved it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Stefan
