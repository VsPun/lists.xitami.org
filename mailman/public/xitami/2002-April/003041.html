<PRE>Hi,

I have had this problem a long time ago, while running Xitami application
(not the service) on NT4.
After switching to the Xitami service 2.4d9 everything worked fine.
Recently I upgraded to Xitami Pro 2.4d10 and experience a few snags.
One of them is that the logs do not get renamed in the log folder and I get
in the xitami.log an error like this

2/04/23  0:00:12: Could not rename 'logs\access.log' to 'logs\ac020423.log'
2/04/23  0:00:12: Permission denied

I've noticed that the configuration files of Xitami Pro 2.4d10, although I
believed at least updated to 2.4d9, they were not. For example, there were
no LRWP 2.0 protocol entries. Also I noticed that the help HTML files were
just copied from 2.4d7 without even changing the version number. Not very
nice for a product that is not free anymore, but anyway, other than this I
am happy with the overall functionality.

I believe there might be some setting that I missed and I wonder if anybody
else ran into this and solved it.

Thanks,

Stefan
