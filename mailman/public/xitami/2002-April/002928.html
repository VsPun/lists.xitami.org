     Well I got the OS/2 version of Xitami running and have been looking for a good 
counter.  My decision came down some tight parameters.  I didn't want a &quot;counter 
service&quot; that could track and spam my users or web page with their logos.  I looked at 
Java and Java script.  But Java often makes browsers especially running on MS 
systems unstable.  I didn't want to enable #EXEC as I did not want the security hole. 
What I wanted something that was &quot;simple&quot; and self contained cgi (ie a cgi I can modify 
and put in without having to install a lot of other stuff).  Finally a cgi that would not count 
reloads.  

     To bad I was not able to find a function in Xitami to count web pages. :/  After two 
days of searching I came across graph counter.  It covered three of the 4 &quot;hoped for&quot; 
functions.  It was simple (needing only 2 edited lines in the cgi file), was completely self 
contained (needed no extra installed graphic handlers), and could be launched by a 
IMG link.  

     I edited and installed the cgi counter script and it counted just fine launching the 
script directly from the browser:  <A HREF="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi">http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi</A>     However 
when I place the IMG link ( IMG SCR=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?0"">http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?0&quot;</A> ) 
into the web page I get a broken link.  The CGI &quot;IS&quot; running when the web page is 
accessed as the count test file does go up.  It just displays a broken link for the image.  

     Any ideas as to what may cause this?  I was beginning to wonder if it was a 
configuration setting in Xitami I missed or just the script?  If you want to look at the cgi I 
am trying to use I have placed it here: <A HREF="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi">http://www.furtopia.org/cgi</A>  if anyone is curious.
