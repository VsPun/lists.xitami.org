If it ends in a graphical suffix, that will &quot;trick&quot; web browsers.

</I>&gt;<i>      Well I got the OS/2 version of Xitami running and have been

</I>&gt;<i> counter.  My decision came down some tight parameters.  I didn't want
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;counter service&quot; that could track and spam my users or web page
</I>&gt;<i> with their logos.  I looked at Java and Java script.  But Java often
</I>&gt;<i> makes browsers especially running on MS systems unstable.  I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> want to enable #EXEC as I did not want the security hole. What I
</I>&gt;<i> wanted something that was &quot;simple&quot; and self contained cgi (ie a cgi I
</I>&gt;<i> can modify and put in without having to install a lot of other stuff).
</I>&gt;<i>  Finally a cgi that would not count reloads.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      To bad I was not able to find a function in Xitami to count web
</I>&gt;<i>      pages. :/  After two 
</I>&gt;<i> days of searching I came across graph counter.  It covered three of
</I>&gt;<i> the 4 &quot;hoped for&quot; functions.  It was simple (needing only 2 edited
</I>&gt;<i> lines in the cgi file), was completely self contained (needed no extra
</I>&gt;<i> installed graphic handlers), and could be launched by a IMG link.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      I edited and installed the cgi counter script and it counted just
</I>&gt;<i>      fine launching the 
</I>&gt;<i> script directly from the browser: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi">http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi</A>     However when I place
</I>&gt;<i> the IMG link ( IMG SCR=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?0"">http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?0&quot;</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ) into the web page I get a broken link.  The CGI &quot;IS&quot; running when
</I>&gt;<i> the web page is accessed as the count test file does go up.  It just
</I>&gt;<i> displays a broken link for the image.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Any ideas as to what may cause this?  I was beginning to wonder
</I>&gt;<i>      if it was a 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration setting in Xitami I missed or just the script?  If you
</I>&gt;<i> want to look at the cgi I am trying to use I have placed it here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi">http://www.furtopia.org/cgi</A>  if anyone is curious.
