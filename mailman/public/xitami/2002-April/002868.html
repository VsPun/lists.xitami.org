<PRE>&gt;<i> Won't the broadband connections take the lion share of the
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth (being able to take more faster in shorter time frame)
</I>&gt;<i> leaving the dialups with the scraps of what they can down feed in
</I>&gt;<i> a bandwidth crunch?
</I>
The effect is insignificant. The chunks are small and Xitami serves
data very soon after each packet is requested. The 56K connections
tend to get about all the data they can handle.

&gt;<i> My experience with running Xitami under NT 4 was it would run fine
</I>&gt;<i> for a week to a month then Xitami would suddenly stop taking
</I>&gt;<i> connections.
</I>
Which Xitami? Under NT, the Service Version is most stable.

The TCP/IP stack in NT 4 is flawed (not as flawed as in Win31, which
would stall every few days). However, my NT4 server runs for months
at a time, has been up since September. What seems to stall it (or
NT's IP stack) is certain FTP clients that my helpers use for huge
site uploads.

One thing- Xitami on NT4 &quot;appears&quot; more stable on my P-350/128M box
than it did on my P-150/32M box. While neither Xitami nor the TCP
stack needs much memory, and indeed it tended to sit with 24-28M
actually used, I wondered if there was something going on when peak
memory demands forced a swap-file action. With Xitami, RealServer,
and a VNC service running, I'm now using 40M out of 128M physical,
so swapping just doesn't happen.

The TCP/IP stack in XP is totally new (actually lifted from one of
the PC unix distributions) and reportedly better. But I've been
happy enough with NT4's uptime that I have not cared to move to XP
(and it certainly would not be snappy on a P-100/32M).
