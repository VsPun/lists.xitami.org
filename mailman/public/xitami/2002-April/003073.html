This gets pretty obvious when reading the docs for PHP :-)  Us Debian users
hardly ever read the docs unless we get something that doesn't work for some
reason - otherwise it's just apt-get install whatever, and it usually
works.  I had to do a little reading for this one - it's been a while since
I built custom apache servers, and the entire INSTALL file for PHP4 is
centered around how to build a static or dynamic module for apache.

</I>
That's the same observation I had.

</I>
My C skills are rusty to non-existant :-)  Otherwise I might spend some time
on this.  I think it would show some merit, though.  Xitami beats apache
hands down for serving static stuff - *WAY* less memory useage, and very
efficient on the cpu.  I've seen Xitami do some amazing things on a little
486/8MB machine that apache could send into a death spiral with no problem
:<i>-)
</I>
&gt;<i> I actually suspect that it's still the same version of Xitami as you
</I>&gt;<i> last noted this problem with.  We haven't noticed the source growing
</I>&gt;<i> new functions all by itself... :-)  (Yes, alas, the release versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami have hardly changed in two years :-(  Even our internal versions
</I>&gt;<i> have changed all that much, although some of the libraries have.)
</I>
I think the last version I tested was 2.4d7.  And you're right - I'm sure
contributions to an open source project would be appreciated!!!

&gt;<i> A number of people have noted this too.  I suspect there's just not
</I>&gt;<i> quite enough checking of all the files going on.  But it's another
</I>&gt;<i> thing that we haven't been able to make enough time to investigate.
</I>
This is really minor for a unix box when you have ssh access, anyway.  But
I'll throw something out;  my workstation is Debian 3.0/2.4.17-k6
kernel/KDE2.2.2.  With Konqueror I can't get the admin panel to work at
all.  With Netscape 6.2 it's funky sometimes.  With Netscape 4.78 I've
actually gotten the server to restart a couple of times, but it's not
consistent.  Do you suppose it might have something to do with the browser
and Javascript compatibility?
