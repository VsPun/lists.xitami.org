<PRE>Hi,

My first post - Xitami/2.5c2 on Windows XP Pro. 

I've made an intranet home page on my computer at work. Only people behind 
the firewall have access to seeing it.

I want to use it as a link page for flash demo files that I create (so 
that other people can see them as I create them). However, when I add a 
link to the Flash container HTML file, Xitami says, &quot;The URL you asked for 
does not exist on this website&quot;. This, of course, is nonsense. The files 
are there. Opening the HTML file in Firefox or IE plays the Flash nicely.

In the link to the file, I have tried both a relative link 
(&quot;/flash/AcceptMeeting.htm&quot;) and absolute links 
(&quot;<A HREF="http://exi_nif-l01.headquarters.excitor.dk/webpages/flash/AcceptMeeting.htm&quot;">http://exi_nif-l01.headquarters.excitor.dk/webpages/flash/AcceptMeeting.htm&quot;</A>).
Now the funny thing is that it actually worked once when I had my computer 
(a laptop) at home, running on my own wireless network.

Xitami has been up and down several times. The swf mime type is listed in 
the xitami.cfg file with no comment sign.

I really hope someone can help me! I'd hate to give up Xitami and go 
IIS..!

(I've got another issue involving PHP and the &quot;file()&quot; command, but I'll 
save that for later!)
