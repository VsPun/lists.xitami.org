<PRE>I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you who replied and offered suggestions pertaining to my bot-troubles.
   
  I sometimes run a copy of Xitami (at port-base 8000) on a test machine while trying out new ideas... and though it works, I'm rather dissatisfied with the overall results of routing WEB-traffic through any port other than 80.  DNS anomalies are the main problem in this case, as I find the domain name often gets dropped altogether, and visitors are left looking at my IP-address and port-number in their browser's address-bar, rather than a domain name. 
   
  FTP on the other hand, is welcome to run on whatever port it will function best...  I have fewer than thirty FTP-users, and absolutely no FTP-port preference whatsoever.  The thought had actually crossed my mind to try an alternate FTP port, but I'm not sure I can do that without disturbing my standard web-port... or at least not without running a second copy of Xitami (or other FTP-daemon). 
   
  Guild or War-FTP on an alternate port, is probably the ultimate solution... and something I'll be looking into again over the next few days.  I took a quick look at both of these FTP-daemons in the past, and remember that one of the two looked very promising, but was going to take more time than I could afford right then, to learn and configure correctly.  The other, was like opening a fresh can of rocket science, and was very quickly dismissed.

  &gt; Also if you go into your windows services you can tell it to auto 
&gt;<i> restart the Xitami service on a crash.

  To be quite honest with you Gene, I've never quite figured out how to run Xitami as a WinXP service.  I have no trouble adding &quot;xigui32.exe&quot; to the list of services, but always encounter failure when trying to start it.  I simply just run the executable, and tick the box that says &quot;Autorun at login&quot;.  The PC itself, loads directly into the desktop on boot-up anyway, so this has never really posed any major issues for me... yet.  I'd eventually like to run Xitami as a service if I can ever figure out what I'm doing wrong... and would definitely take advantage of the settings you suggest. 
   
  There are times most recently however, when I've discovered Xitami stunned, in a 'suspended' state (red icon in the system-tray), where it hasn't actually crashed until I've attempted to resume or restart it. 
   
  Thank you all once again for your valuable information and speedy response.
   
  Rod
