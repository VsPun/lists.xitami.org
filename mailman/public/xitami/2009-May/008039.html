<PRE>Hi Russel,

If it were me, I'd try to rule out what it isn't - which sounds like you're
well on the way with doing. It's conclusively not MySQL (the checks/fixups
are fairly comprehensive!) and you think it might not be Perl.

&quot;SOFTWARE ERROR: Error getting data!&quot; is a new one on me! But try doing a
simple string search within your Perl code first for all (or portions) of
the error message.

Second thing to try, and with regards to the service halting for no apparent
reason: If it's on a Windows box, have you checked in Event Viewer
(Application and/or System)? Whilst some of the events are pretty
inconclusive, it might just point you in the right direction. Also, Xitami's
file based logs (console.log, etc) might also give you some indication.

Finally, have you tried ruling out the binding to different IP's by running
your &lt;insert Perl app name here&gt; on an independent box?

Cheers,
Stuart

Well, I don't know whats going on now.

I am running a secnd TEST Xitami server, on a different IP but on the same 
physical server, and it to is experiencing the same issue.  However after 
the defrag only the production Xitami service had stopped, the test Xitami 
service was still running.  But its the same useless answer:

SOFTWARE ERROR: Error getting data!

Has anyone seen this before or have any insight into what the heck is going 
on?

&gt;<i> Xitami ver 2.4d9
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did a defrag on my server last night, went to bed and when I woke up the
</I>
&gt;<i> Xitami service had stopped.  I restarted the service and it seems to have 
</I>&gt;<i> come up fine.  And I can get to the main pages of my website.  Every page,
</I>
&gt;<i> even the landing page, requires MySQL db lookups to generate the page 
</I>&gt;<i> being viewed.  However when I go deeper into the site to start looking at 
</I>&gt;<i> specific article listings and the articles themselves I get a weird:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SOFTWARE ERROR: Error getting data!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats it...nothing else.  I can login manually to the server and retrieve 
</I>&gt;<i> the data sets from MySQL via a command prompt, I have run full MySQL error
</I>
&gt;<i> checking and optimization and everything in MySQL seems to check out. 
</I>&gt;<i> Perl seems to run fine...all scripts run fine from command prompt.so the 
</I>&gt;<i> only thing left is a problem with Xitami.  And now that I think about it, 
</I>&gt;<i> even before I did the defrag I was getting the same (or similar) error 
</I>&gt;<i> when the webserver was trying to call up article listings - it would run 
</I>&gt;<i> and run and then eventually I would get that error as if it were timing 
</I>&gt;<i> out.  However the error happening this morning is happening immediately, 
</I>&gt;<i> click the link and no delay - just the error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Google turns up virtually nothing on Perl/MySQL/Xitami and &quot;Error getting 
</I>&gt;<i> data&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a hunch this is a Xitami CGI error, but can't be for certain.
