<PRE>fwiw.... i just installed xifusion and cfexpress last night and had a
searchable online database in probably less then 1/2 hour from the time I
downloaded them both.

That was a lot of fun.

You -may- find that this is slow. And rather than fret about
webserver theory, it may be better to find (or even buy) a P-400.

I have a super-simple notice-posting script on a P-150. Even via
modem, the delays while WinPerl starts up and thinks are noticeable.
For one user, no big deal. For hundreds, using a full-featured
script, even considering the low duty rate, you may want more CPU.

BTW, AFAIK all &quot;P-90&quot;s were really P-100 chips sold at a lower
price. Not that &quot;overclocking&quot; from 90 to 100 will knock your socks
off....

My *favorite* forum (user-interface as much as content) uses UBB.
Very simple for users, and apparently simple to administer. It runs
with Perl; though it seems there is also a port to PHP/MySQL.

I am not sure where it really comes from. These people sell it for
$199 and up:

Free trial, requires your contact info, max 30 members, 50 posts,
and 1000 page views, lacks some moderator functions:
