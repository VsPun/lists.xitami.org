<PRE>  I'm sorry for just now responding to your reply.  Hopefully, I will soon 
be able to work the list properly~

  niall,

  I'm not sure what the robots.txt is, but I'm running a chronic pain 
support group to help sufferers find doctors not afraid to use narcotics to 
control pain, it's <A HREF="http://www.sorcep.com">http://www.sorcep.com</A> ; Sorce-P

  I still can't figure out why it will not list ANYWHERE?   At this point, I 
would settle for 'last'!  Thanks all!

  John

  Hello all,

  I am having problems getting my site listed in the major search engines.
Even with free sites like Geocities, I was able to at least be listed in
Google.  Is it because the search engines look at sites hosted on your own
computer (with Xitami), differently than sites hosted in other ways?  Any
help or advice would be appreciated!  I have gone to great lengths to
compile meta tags, and title indexes.  I know of people who don't even use
meta tags, or go to any effort to list their sites, yet they are listed way
up in them, and it has just gotten frustrating to me.. Thank and I hope
everyone is doing well!  have a good day.

  PS:  Would someone send (to my email address), the exact link that I need
to use to come read, and post to this list online, without reading and
posting through my email service?  I &quot;just&quot; now realized that I do not get
many posts to my email, like other lists!  Only very few actually come
there!  Thanks all!

   John - {dummy}
