<PRE>Ok this is getting rather bad.  I have posted about 5 questions and have got no 
responses.  I have written Xitami help after waiting a couple weeks here for a response 
first and got no reply there either.  If anyone has any information someone PLEASE help 
if you know anything?

First Mozilla reports Xitami web server doesn't support resuming.  Does anyone know 
why this error is reported and is there a setting in Xitami for this?

Second my Xitami used to almost never crash (2.4d7 for OS/2).  I have a cmd file to loop 
it.  But recently it has been crashing several times a day.  The more vhosts I add the 
more often it seems to crash.  My fan art server has grown recently and there is about 
40 virtual hosts now defined.  Sometimes a user accesses a directory or even I look at a 
virtual domain from my browser and Xitami drops it's core and reloads.  I can try to 
access the same vhost  3 times in a row and it will drop it's core three times and then 
perhaps on the forth work just fine (for a while).

My memtrace.list is here:  <A HREF="http://www.dragoncity.net/memtrace.lst">http://www.dragoncity.net/memtrace.lst</A>  Some common errors 
are:

smthttp.c  (1052)  [0x3fa020]
sflsymb.c (561)    [0x1a7da0]

The web server is running on a Pentium 100 with a intel TX (I think) chipset.  My original 
reasoning to leave it on my pentium 100 was that CGI was being run on a different 
machine.  My pemtium almost never goes over 8% CPU usage and the Pentium seems 
(to me) to be very stable.  However it seems to me the more apps that are running the 
more often Xitami is to crash.  However &quot;only&quot; Xitami crashes everything else runs fine.  
Again it is not speed I am woried about.  I have a K6-2 550 system I can put Xitami on if 
needed.  The reason it's on the Pentium is it seemed very stable and it seemed to run 
Xitami as quick as my faster boxes.  Would a newer version of Xitami help?  Would a 
faster system help?

Any insight to this problem would be greatly appreciated as I badly need to get my 
Xitami server stable again.

  Thanks!  Gene Angel
