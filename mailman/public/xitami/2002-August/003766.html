&gt;<i>  Ok need some serious advice folks. :)  I am adding CGI services to my 
</I>&gt;<i>web hosting.  I am rather new to CGI so I am not sure what will work 
</I>&gt;<i>best and thus could use some advice.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My CGI server and webserver will be on two separate machines both 
</I>&gt;<i>running Xitami (I figure a DOS attack on the CGI will not bring down my 
</I>&gt;<i>web server then and the CGI process overhead won't lag the web 
</I>&gt;<i>pages ;).  My CGI server is a dual pentuim 90 running NT4 server, 
</I>&gt;<i>Xitami  and Zone Alarm.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I really don't have deep pockets (I just run a fan art site with no 
</I>&gt;<i>advertising) so very low cost/GNU is important.  I would like to find a 
</I>&gt;<i>good CGI script to create &quot;Forums&quot;/message board for my users to 
</I>&gt;<i>discuss art. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyone here with experience in what software would work best for me?  
</I>&gt;<i>I have heard that Active Perl is good and cygwin is helpful.  But again I 
</I>&gt;<i>am new to CGI.  Also if any of you can suggest a decent and free 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;message board&quot; script that would be handy too.
</I>
PHP, Perl, Nuclear Vision (wait, that costs $35...that's probably too much
for you, even though it is easier to use than PHP or Perl), CFExpress (the
full version of CF is something like $2000/$5000..._WAY_ out of your price
range), and anything you feel like writing (Borland offers their compiler
for free) are all low/no-cost options for CGI-based programming.

Personally, I've found the Perl scripting engine to be too slow (at least
compared with PHP and Nuclear Vision).  However, Perl does have some really
powerful built-in RegEx support...which comes in handy on occasion.

&gt;<i>Thanks again I can use all the advice I can get! ;)
</I>
Hope this helps!
