<PRE> I host a couple small personal sites at home over DSL using Xitami and
ZoneEdit.  A few days ago there was something going on with my connection.
I could surf for a few minutes, then nothing could be found for a few
minutes.  Then it seemed to be just certain sites. (though not related to
sites stored in cache) That seems to have cleared up, but I still cannot
surf to the sites hosted on my computer, from anywhere.  I am assuming the
problems are related.  

I called the tech support company for my DSL provider and got exactly what I
expected.  I feel the blank stare coming from the other end o the line
through my phone.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
Mike
