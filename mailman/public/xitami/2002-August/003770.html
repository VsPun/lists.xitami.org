<PRE>This is personal project and personal expense which is why I have to be careful how 
much I spend.  $25-$45 for example would NOT to much to spend for something that will 
be really useful to me.  But it is personal my funds so I don't want to rush out and buy 
software that I will never be able to use.  $1000-$5000 I think can be easily seen as 
WAY out of range for a little &quot;hobby at home pc web page&quot;.  Again this is why I am 
asking for advice.

My main goal right now is to get a &quot;standard compatible&quot;/Perl CGI up and running for 
users and for programs we would like to run in the future.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;My CGI server and webserver will be on two separate machines both 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;running Xitami (I figure a DOS attack on the CGI will not bring down my 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;web server then and the CGI process overhead won't lag the web 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;pages ;).  My CGI server is a dual pentuim 90 running NT4 server, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Xitami  and Zone Alarm.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I really don't have deep pockets (I just run a fan art site with no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;advertising) so very low cost/GNU is important.  I would like to find a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;good CGI script to create &quot;Forums&quot;/message board for my users to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;discuss art. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Anyone here with experience in what software would work best for me?  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I have heard that Active Perl is good and cygwin is helpful.  But again I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;am new to CGI.  Also if any of you can suggest a decent and free 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;message board&quot; script that would be handy too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PHP, Perl, Nuclear Vision (wait, that costs $35...that's probably too much
</I>&gt;<i> for you, even though it is easier to use than PHP or Perl), CFExpress (the
</I>&gt;<i> full version of CF is something like $2000/$5000..._WAY_ out of your price
</I>&gt;<i> range), and anything you feel like writing (Borland offers their compiler
</I>&gt;<i> for free) are all low/no-cost options for CGI-based programming.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I've found the Perl scripting engine to be too slow (at least
</I>&gt;<i> compared with PHP and Nuclear Vision).  However, Perl does have some really
</I>&gt;<i> powerful built-in RegEx support...which comes in handy on occasion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Thanks again I can use all the advice I can get! ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps!
