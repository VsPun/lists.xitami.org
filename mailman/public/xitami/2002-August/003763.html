<PRE>You may want to concider a &quot;spam filter&quot;.  I decided to use one and it 
was a good decision.  I get around 200-300 spam a day.  Yet I need to 
field messages from my online users.  My spam filter scans messages 
from the To, From, Subject, and Body.  It also has a &quot;pass through&quot; with 
domains I don't want to filter.  As I got spam I would added a phrase in 
my spam filter body scan to catch them.  Took me about a month to 
build up my word list (use phrases as short words my get a legit e-mail, 
&quot;our customers, free viagra, xxx sluts, etc&quot;.  You will &quot;almost&quot; never get 
these in a legit e-mail).  Now dispite all the spam my regular e-mails 
come through and a spam may slip through once a week (getting 
promptly added to the filter).  

I have been on the Xitami list a few years now I believe.  I don't recall 
any spam from them (their address is unfiltered for me).
