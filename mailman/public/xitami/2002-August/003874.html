<PRE>&gt;<i>  have got no responses.
</I>
It's august. Everybody (at least in the northern side of the globe)
is on vacation.

&gt;<i> doesn't support resuming. Does anyone know why this error is
</I>&gt;<i> reported and is there a setting in Xitami for this?
</I>
Xitami reports itself as HTTP 1.0. Resume was not an HTTP feature
until 1.1. Xitami actually does support many HTTP 1.1 features. I do
not know if Resume is one of them.

&gt;<i> Second my Xitami used to almost never crash
</I>
What operating system??? How much RAM you got in that box?

I have several dozen v-hosts running on a P-150 with 32Megs under
NT4. Except the FTP service, it never falls down. Including rare
large FTP sessions, it goes down maybe 4 times a year.

So I would wonder about your O/S, corrosion on RAM sockets, drive
volume corruption, or using the Xitami FTP service (which is
admitted to be lightweight and known to crash).

Recent releases of Win-Apache are actually quite good. I ended up
having to use it to work-around a stupid bug in an otherwise
excellent script (later I did find the Xitami fix but it was not
worth taking the machine down to dump Apache). Apache still has that
monster config file instead of the sweet GUI in Xitami; otherwise I
think modern Apache may be the better tool for heavier sites. Xitami
is still faster, but that is not an issue even with your load on a
P-100.
