I don't man....sounds spooky to me!  LOL  2.4d6 was the most stable version of Xitami, I too still use it but my server has been down for the last week for hardware maintenance so I wasn't able to observe any spookiness. 

Maybe it was your service provider that was having issues causing and creating delays for traffic to and from your server. Maybe check with them.

In Europe, at least Germany, Summertime changes on the last weekend of October - so this was.
I also had great problems on Friday and Saturday, but in my case it was a problem of DynDNS that did not handle the IP updates correctly. System running stable for the past three years, it was the first time that I got such trouble, so I read that first mail from Hogan twice.

Still running 2.4d6, stable...

I have been having unreliable results with external stylesheets with Xitami 
2.4d10 under Windows with Chrome browser.

The same test site that fails with Chrome browser when served by Xitami 
works fine with Apache.

I tried everything to do with DTD and @charset etc.

Unless someone can identify why Xitami does this it's time to move on ...

Whoops - found the solution.  Now Chrome works with external stylesheets.

Edit defaults.cfg and add the two lines:

[Mime]
     css=text/css

I didn't even have to restart Xitami.

Looks like Xitami is the one with the problem here. I wouldn't worry 
about it though. I've personally never even heard of it before, thus, it 
isn't very popular.

I saw this same response on welovecss.com
www.welovecss.com/showthread.php?t=4075 when I was searching for an answer
to this issue.  I wasn't sure if the poster, meesa, was saying that they
never heard of Xitami or that they never heard of the problem.  Was that
you?

The problem for me is that my version of Xitami 2.4d6, the version that I
have used for 9+ years without a problem, with the new Chrome 6 only appears
to work properly with DOCTYPE of <!DOCTYPE> - anything more in the angle
brackets and the page doesn't respect the CSS.  Weird.  I agree that it is a
Xitami issue.  Previously, for some reason, a <!DOCTYPE ... /> of anything
in the brackets but ending in a '/>' worked for all browsers but never
passed the validator.w3.org test wit it like that - but it worked.

When I posted this a few weeks ago, I was asking whether anyone else had
experienced this but yours was the only response so I made the issue a bit
clearer above and again ask for comment.

Thank you.

Gordon,

This did NOT work for me.  I added the line in the defaults.cfg with a
"normal" DOCTYPE and page was wacky.  Tried restarting Xitami.  No change.
Tried adding line to MIME section of xitami.cfg with and without a restart -
no difference.  For me the only thing that works is using a DOCTYPE of
<!DOCTYPE>

Would you mind giving me the page address that now works for you.  I'd like
to see what you have in your CSS. Thanks.

Phil

Whoops - found the solution.  Now Chrome works with external stylesheets.

Edit defaults.cfg and add the two lines:

[Mime]
     css=text/css

I didn't even have to restart Xitami.

I have been having unreliable results with external stylesheets with Xitami
2.4d10 under Windows with Chrome browser.
The same test site that fails with Chrome browser when served by Xitami
works fine with Apache.
I tried everything to do with DTD and @charset etc.
Unless someone can identify why Xitami does this it's time to move on ...

I am using Xitami 2.4d10 under Windows 2000 Pro and had been fighting for 
months with how Chrome (only Chrome) completely ignored external css files.

But all was fine after I told Xitami yesterday that .css files were of type 
text/css in defaults.cfg:
[Mime]
      css=text/css

Now it does not matter what <!DOCTYPE> I use:
- HTML 4.01 strict
- HTML 4.01 transitional
- XHTML 1.0 Transitional
- even with a missing <!DOCTYPE> line the external CSS works !


My current working test site setup:

HTML 4.01 strict in pages:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

In the <head> I specified charset:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;CHARSET=iso-8859-1">

In the external CSS the matching charset specification was the first line:
@charset "iso-8859-1";

External stylesheet reference was:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/style.css">

How is your page wacky?  Can you confirm that 2.4d6 understands the new 
lines in defaults.cfg ?

I will send you the link to the working page.

Thanks Gordon.  It seems to be working.  I think the [Mime] line must have
been working before but I was looking at cached copies of my pages.  Good
find.

15 years ago, CSS was only a draft proposal.  10 years ago it was not 
commonly used.  Xitami version 2.4 is probably 15 years old which could 
explain why the MIME type for CSS was not listed in the config.

No problem.  Glad to point others to the solution.

I am even running Drupal 6 on Xitami 2.4.  Unfortunately, the world is 
going with the .htaccess and mod_rewrite standards for clean URLs so we 
have to go with Apache eventually.
