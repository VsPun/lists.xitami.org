&gt;<i> As you pointed out, only exe's get run, but the key to getting IIS to
</I>accept an exe is a little 16k dll that acts as a 'thunking' layer. The dll
is named the same as its larger exe brother..call the dll in the script and
the exe is run, which in turn returns the page. I realize now that this
applies only for IIS. I had used o'Reilly in the distant past [ and may
have to use it again ??] and it recognized the the .exe extension. Xitami
appears to make a leap of faith that this is a script [ given the cg-bin in
the tag ]
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I've tried is to NOT use the dll extension and call the exe
</I>directly..but use just the file name instead. cgi-bin/MZload1 with no file
extension. I get a blank page returned. Look on the bright side at least it
found something this time out, and judging by the brief delay it looks as
if something is being run.

I'd still give the ISAPI Add-On a shot.  Also use Task Manager (assuming
you run WinNT/2000/XP) to see if that shows the executable launching and
stopping (even if it is only for a short bit...may require reloading
several times in the browser).

Hope this helps!
