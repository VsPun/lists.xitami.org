<PRE>Hello !

see the specific responses after the questions.

</I>&gt;<i>If you know this, why are you using that port?  I made specific note of it

Our ISP only makes the standard internet ports available.
That is: 25, 80, 119, ...
Only 119 is left over.
Port 80 is used for our normal webserver, port 119 is used for a limited 
group of users.



&gt;<i> &gt;It is not a problem with firewalls and ISP: when using a Netscape browser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(on the same computer), the page can be retrieved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Your assumption that, at the firewall level, packets are not affected is an
</I>&gt;<i>incorrect assumption.  Firewalls can and _DO_ interfere depending on
</I>&gt;<i>whether they are passive or not.
</I>
I'm not a firewall specialist, but how could a request from Netscape be let 
through, and a request by IE blocked? (Using the same computer)
After upgrading from IE 4.0 to IE 6.0 the request was also blocked.
So i assume it's a Internet explorer thing.



&gt;<i> &gt;For now i suggest users to use Netscape. For now the site is only for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;limited user group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Well, you will be continuing to limit your user group if you force them to
</I>&gt;<i>use older versions of IE or use Mozilla/Netscrape.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm looking for some register fix to allow IE to connect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This is probably the best way to lose users/customers...tell them they have
</I>&gt;<i>to modify the Windows registry to visit your site.
</I>
I'm not afraid of losing users ... there are very captive indeed: the 
server is used by our sales representatives to get some (private) 
informations from our site when there are on location or at home.
They are all used to IE and don't quite like netscape...

Having to use port 119 is a good thing (no virus of other malevolent user 
is actually trying to connect)...


I'm not used that the correspondents completely understand my questions 
from the first run (english is my 3rd language), so i tried again from the 
beginning. Maybe i didn't made it clear enough that it is just some sort of 
communication between &quot;registered&quot; users who don't mind that i mix with 
their computer's registry.

&gt;<i>If I sound a bit upset, it is because:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1)  I gave several suggestions on how to fix the problem and you failed to
</I>&gt;<i>address those suggestions in your response.
</I>&gt;<i>2)  You attempted to rephrase your problem that I already completely
</I>&gt;<i>understood as if I didn't understand the problem completely.
</I>&gt;<i>3)  You seek an answer that will destroy your current and future customer
</I>&gt;<i>base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The third reason is what I am most concerned about here.  You seem to have
</I>&gt;<i>no concern for your customers...and you will ultimately lose them as a
</I>&gt;<i>result.  If you don't deal with this issue properly, you will end up losing
</I>&gt;<i>even your most loyal customers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hope this helps!
</I>
Nope.
