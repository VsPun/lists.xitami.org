You are not right in saying i don't care for my users.
Most of the programming (the cgi interface) is done at home in my free time.
I've explored all the alternatives: another IP: too expensive for the boss 
(i agree with him)
Open other ports: ISP's representative sent a standard message back that 
states wich ports can be opened. Can't talk to an autoresponder.
Another ISP: too much work, not sure it will be better (other providers 
don't allow us to run servers for the same price we pay for our current 
connection).
Compared to the cost of another IP, a simple registry trick (if available) 
will be very appreciated!

My job is indeed to make sure my users (sales rep.) can do easily whatever 
they want to do: access their IMAP mail and local directories, connect to 
our SQL server, and all this using a single interface: Internet Explorer. 
All this configuration is done after hours.
And since the normal &quot;web&quot; port is already reserved for visiting customers, 
i have to use another port.
