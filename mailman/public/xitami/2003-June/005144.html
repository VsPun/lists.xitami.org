<PRE>Thanks Ross,

What you said makes absolute sense.  I was looking through my defaults.cfg
file and I found a line that said...

*=virtualhost.cfg

However, that asterisk wasn't letting me access the virtualhost web until I
physically changed it to 127.0.0.1.  I don't know why the * wasn't working
except that that was how the xitami.cfg file was set up with ip addresses.
That file had a line in it that said...

*=ipaddress

Anyway, I got it working the way that I wanted to.  I can even access my
server using my Internet ip address, too.  Now I can get back to work. :)

Bill

&gt;<i> Bill,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The best (fastest) way to test out your websites, cgi, etc. is locally
</I>&gt;<i> (127.0.0.1).  However, your virtual host must be setup for that address
</I>&gt;<i> (127.0.0.1).  If you have no virtual host pointing explicitly to
</I>127.0.0.1,
&gt;<i> Xitami will default to either the default or baseline (if there is one)
</I>&gt;<i> virtual hosts when you try to browse 127.0.0.1 (<A HREF="http://localhost">http://localhost</A> resolves
</I>to
&gt;<i> 127.0.0.1 by the way, they are interchangeable).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now suppose you get that working but you want to test it from the
</I>&quot;outside&quot;.
&gt;<i> You would need to setup another virtual host that corresponds with your
</I>&gt;<i> cable IP address (or a domain name pointing to that address, if you have
</I>&gt;<i> one).  Or again, Xitami will use it's default/baseline settings because it
</I>&gt;<i> won't find a virtual host corresponding to the IP you are trying to
</I>browse.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this makes some sense!
</I>&gt;<i> -Ross
