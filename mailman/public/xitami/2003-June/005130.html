<PRE>Can't be of any help on Ioncube, don't even know what it is, but I installed
Xitami on a box the other day for a replacement of and Omni box for our
Calendar Scheduling App. Installed PHP, believe it was 4.3.1, no special
problems incountered. During the install need to select the advanced install
type to id Xitami as the server and choose both .php and .php3, if you need
backward compat, I usually add it just in case. Other than that, configuring
is all that should be necessary. I used Xitami's Web Admin capability for
this. Just use the user/password you gave it during the install. When the
page comes up go to the Configuration page and use the MIME link in the
upper right corner. You need to enter 'php' in the first field and
'application/x-httpd-php' in the second. No quotes of course. Hit save. Hit
Configuration again, Find the filters link and hit it. The extensions should
be listed with 'C:\php\php.exe' listed as the filter command. Down lower on
this page you may want to change the default page listings. Hit save back to
the config page. Find and hit the security link. Hit the Define Button, it's
under the Password File section. The admin link should show your
user/password combo you added during the install. The private link will show
a dummy record that Xitami adds during install, change it to what you want
to use. Hit save three times to get back to the Admin page. Hit Restart and
wait a second or two. Then close the browser, your done. After this I tested
the Php install be using a phpinfo script and ran it to see if all was well.
It was so I went on and installed our calendar and it functioned just fine.
In the process of making an image now.
