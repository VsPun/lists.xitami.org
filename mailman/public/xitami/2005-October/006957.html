<PRE>I had the opposite experience.  When I started with Verizon, all inbound 
traffic was blocked.  Somewhere down the line, without any warning, all 
inbound traffic was enabled.  I had no idea that had happened until I 
was playing around with Zone Alarm one day.  It started pumping out 
warnings on ports all over the place.  I very quickly checked and upped 
my security settings to make sure I was covered.

Since they were cavalier about letting me know that they had exposed me, 
I felt little guilt about setting up a web server on my machine.  As my 
DSL modem hasn't lost power (it's on a UPS) my IP hasn't changed in 
close to 6 months now.

But none of this is germain to the question.  It does sound like the ISP 
is blocking the inbound connections on port 21.
