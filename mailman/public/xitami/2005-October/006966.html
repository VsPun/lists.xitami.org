<PRE> 
 
I have been successfully hosting a small website with Xitami for some years now. I am currently using version 2.52c as a service, running on Windows XP. The site layout was recently changed, and at the request of the designer I added php (current version, 5.0.5). The new site came up about a month ago with php plus some java scripts, and it also calls for Macromedia's Flash Player plugin. The earlier incarnations of the website just ran straightforward html, and they virtually never crashed. However, the new site has gone down two or three times a week. When it does go down and I check the server, either I can't log on or I get &quot;Insufficient system resources&quot; OS error messages. Either way, there is nothing I can do except reboot, and then everything is fine -  for a few days until the next crash. The crash log does not have a listing, and the other logs haven't given me anything useful. Configuration tweaks I have tried have not helped, and there is no evidence of any hardware problems.

 

I have started to experiment some with using the applications, both the GUI and console version, rather than the service. I seem to be having a little more success with them. At least it I just have to restart the application rather than the whole computer.

 

Well, I have got to have better stability than this, even if it means switching to another web server. But I have grown fond of Xitami over the years and would like to keep using it if I can. If anyone knows of something else I should look into on this, I would appreciate hearing about it.

 

Thanks a lot.
