<PRE>This sounds like a memory leak problem. I would use some type of utility to
see how much memory each program is using right after reboot and then a few
hours later and then again the next day, You may be able to gauge what
program is causing the problems. I run Xatami and PHP together and have
never had any problems. You may even be able to make a good guess at which
program is leaking memory by using task manager.

  Subject: [Xitami] PHP and crashing




  I have been successfully hosting a small website with Xitami for some
years now. I am currently using version 2.52c as a service, running on
Windows XP. The site layout was recently changed, and at the request of the
designer I added php (current version, 5.0.5). The new site came up about a
month ago with php plus some java scripts, and it also calls for
Macromedia's Flash Player plugin. The earlier incarnations of the website
just ran straightforward html, and they virtually never crashed. However,
the new site has gone down two or three times a week. When it does go down
and I check the server, either I can't log on or I get &quot;Insufficient system
resources&quot; OS error messages. Either way, there is nothing I can do except
reboot, and then everything is fine -  for a few days until the next crash.
The crash log does not have a listing, and the other logs haven't given me
anything useful. Configuration tweaks I have tried have not helped, and
there is no evidence of any hardware problems.



  I have started to experiment some with using the applications, both the
GUI and console version, rather than the service. I seem to be having a
little more success with them. At least it I just have to restart the
application rather than the whole computer.



  Well, I have got to have better stability than this, even if it means
switching to another web server. But I have grown fond of Xitami over the
years and would like to keep using it if I can. If anyone knows of something
else I should look into on this, I would appreciate hearing about it.



  Thanks a lot.
