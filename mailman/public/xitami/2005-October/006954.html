<PRE>&gt;<i>   the wireless router mentioned above, is actually a brand new
</I>&gt;<i>   replacement
</I>&gt;<i> for an older (linksys befsr41 ver.2 &quot;wired&quot;) router which was
</I>&gt;<i> previously assumed to be the cause of this issue.
</I>
Well, in that case, it's possibly
1) the router's PPPoE that doesn't work with the ISP*) (both are 
likely using very similar code as they are from the same 
manufacturer) or
2) your ISP's DHCP server having a very short lease time or being 
bonkers in some other way. Can't you eliminate the router as a cause 
by setting up a computer directly connected to the modem?

Try to get through to a real tech person, it would be most 
interesting to know if the DHCP server receives requests at a fixed 
interval, for example. They have all the possibilities to help you 
with your problem... if they want.

There is also always the option of buying your own DSL modem, or 
borrowing someone else's for a while, to eliminate one more problem.


(* I noticed it worked before, but they could have changed something 
on their side
