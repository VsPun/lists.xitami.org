<PRE>Hi everyone,

My main HTML directory is the default one, &quot;webpages&quot;. I also have another
directory, in the Xitami working directory, named &quot;emergency&quot;. In &quot;emergency&quot;,
there is only a very basic, plain, small index.html file that says that the
server is temporarily down. What I wanted to do was to go to the WBA and change
the main HTML dir to &quot;emergency&quot; in case of an emergency, quickly and easily.
Well, it works. But when I changed back to &quot;webpages&quot; for normal operation,
waited for the config refresh timeout (5 seconds), and even clicked &quot;Restart&quot; in
the WBA, Xitami kept showing the &quot;server down&quot; page. Note that the WBA showed
&quot;webpages&quot; as the main HTML dir. No it wasn't about cache because I saw the page
being requested in the access logs every time I hit Ctrl+F5 in Internet Explorer
and Xitami is set to *not* to &quot;cache default pages&quot;. So as a last resort I
restarted the Xitami service and it finally went back to showing my normal
pages. Phew...

Also a while ago, when I was playing around with log file formats and my config
refresh timeout was set to 1 second, Xitami once again wouldn't change the way
it logged access data, even though I tried all kinds of log cycle settings
including &quot;at startup&quot;, and even clicked the Restart button in the WBA. And, the
same as above, restarting the service would force Xitami to &quot;see&quot; the changes
I'd made.

Did I overlook anything in these two situations? Isn't the Restart button
supposed to do a full restart of the service except unloading/loading the Xitami
executable code? Or possibly bugs?

Thanks,



Utku Uzmen
