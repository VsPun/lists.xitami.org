<PRE>For months I have been trying to figure out why it would crash every couple
of hours.  A couple weeks ago my computer starting crashing literally every
5 minutes.  I spent this weekend trying to figure that out.  What finally
fixed it was taking out one of the processors.

It's an Abit VP6 board with 2 PIII 700's. I pulled one of the PIII's,
restarted the machine and everything has worked fine for a week now, haven't
had to restart anything once.  Not sure what is actually wrong, I didn't try
putting the CPU back in and pulling the other.  I may have gotten lucky and
pulled a bad cpu the first try but I would bet it's the board.  If it's
hardware related that is.  So I am either going to get a different dual
board, or get a new board and newer processors.


Thanks to all who tried to help me &quot;fix&quot; Xitami.
