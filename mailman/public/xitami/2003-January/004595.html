<PRE>perhaps slightly off topic, but as I'm trying to avoid taking Xitami offline
I thought I'd ask:

I'm interested in running Xitami, IIS and perhaps Apache for educational and
light practical purposes.  I'm wondering if I were to set each up on its own
machine behind my firewall, and open a differect port to access each one,
how that would work with my DNS and URLs.... Would every URL for a server
NOT on port 80 need to have the &quot;.com:port#&quot; appended to it, or is that
something I could set up with the DNS... (akin to &quot;forward all www.blah.com
requests to 111.111.111.111:1080, all www.blahblah.com to
111.111.111.111:2080).

If I were not to register 3 domain names, would the port stay open after the
first &quot;111.111.111.111:1080&quot; call, or if I were to follow a relative link
from that index page, say, to a prduct page on the same site, would my
browser stay on the same port?

Does the question make sense?

Would keeping IIS on a port other then 80 make it less likely to be hit by
the 20K of hack attacks I get in the Xitami logs every day?  All I'm
interested in doing with IIS is learning more about ASP as well as perhaps
throwing up some quick &quot;MS Access web data sheets&quot;

Thanks for any help, and again, sorry if off topic.

Michael
