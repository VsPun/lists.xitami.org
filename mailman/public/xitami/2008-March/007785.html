<PRE>&gt;<i> Also, I still vote for a Xitami to be picked up and development 
</I>&gt;<i> continued again.  Unfortunately, I am not a C programer - if I were I

</I>
The problem is that there are actively maintained alternatives out 
there. Apache is much more full featured, much less buggy, runs PHP as a 
module, and it's not even that slow anymore (although nowhere near 
Xitami for static content). And there is Lighttpd, which is a project 
with the same goals as originally Xitami, but still developed, with a 
broader userbase /and/ extreme performance.

In all fairness, Xitami is better in some respects than both these 
products, especially regarding the built-in and quite usable web admin 
interface. But it has never been &quot;in style&quot;, and I don't see that 
happening without a couple of high-profile sites adopting it. Which 
won't happen, because it's not actively maintained. You see where this 
is going :-(
