So, I just checked out the xitami.wikidot.com page - very cool.  Wasn't there going to be a email archive program to be used that was going to parse through all the email archives and re-organize everything into a searchable database?  At the whole time of the discussion of wikidot I thought the mail was going to be converted too?

Is the conversion live?  Meaning we continue to email to the list, and all new emails remain on the List Archive but are also simultaneously imported into the converted database?  Can't recall how it was too work and since I can't search the archive easily I found it too troublesome to weed through all the threads to find those original emails to see if the answer was in there.

:<i>-)

Also, I still vote for a Xitami to be picked up and development continued again.  Unfortunately, I am not a C programer - if I were I would have been contributing long ago.  But what I am more than willing to do is contribute time and $$$ since I am unable to contribute skills.  I just love Xitami too much to see it whither away into nothingness.

Maybe my contribution could be a new web admin interface and continued documentation?  Just thinking out loud.
