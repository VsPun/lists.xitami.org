<PRE>So what you are saying if I do a port scan on my server with 28 IP addresses
bound to my one NIC card I should see 29 port 80's is that correct? Last
time I checked when I did a port scan I only saw one port 80. Hmmm I wonder
why that is?????  I can't get more than one server to run on port 80 no
matter how many IP addresses I have.  Oh and I'm pretty sure that the Port
is part of the TCP and UDP header not part of the IP Address.  I'll go back
and look at my network training material just to make sure it's been awhile
so I could be wrong.

Ron: 

As everyone keeps trying to say, TCP Port 80 is a product of TCP/IP - not a
product of 3Com NIC or BroadBand NIC cards.  Its also NOT a product of
Windows or MAC or UNIX or a router.  TCP Ports can only exist IF an IP
address is present.  Each IP has its own 64,000 range of Ports. 

In Apache:

The section that starts with &quot;One Machine, Two IP Addresses&quot;....when they
say Machine/Computer, they mean NIC.

</I>&gt;<i> (which you yourself could have found googling for one second, or just

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Processes implement connections to TCP and UDP ports by means of 
</I>&gt;<i> sockets. A socket is a transport end-point, which a process can create

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> that fits you, because then you're truly beyond help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm all for learning people more about networking (even the most basic

</I>&gt;<i> about something they should know if they actually had any business

</I>&gt;<i> take over trying to explain the absolute basics of TCP/IP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and by the way, you mention that you didn't manage to get Xitami 
</I>&gt;<i> working this way. I have a very simple explanation for that, that 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't involve Xitami, your computer, or the fundamentals of TCP/IP 
</I>&gt;<i> being broken.
