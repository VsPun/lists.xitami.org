<PRE>Here's some sloppy thinking from someone who knew the ARPAnet, drifted 
away, and on return had to learn this newfangled TCP stuff.

 &gt; You have one port 80

IP is street address.

Port is a box at that address.

Clearly you can have 1234 Oak St Box 80, and 1235 Oak St Box 80, without 
mix-up. 192.168.1.100:80 and 192.168.1.101:80 are -different- logical 
places, even if they are same physical card in same machine.

What RO was trying -SHOULD- work.

Well, maybe. I'm constantly getting mail for &quot;141&quot; in other 
buildings/streets. My mailman does not always get it right.

Hierarchical addressing systems are easy to screw-up. Mailman sorts 
right only 99% of the time. If you are building a machine, it is easy to 
overlook something, get it 99% right. If it screws-up only in unusual 
situations, it may go unnoticed for a decade.

If this were Mac O/S 7, or Win 311, I'd bet on the tossed-together 
non-unix TCP stacks of that vintage. But W2K+ stole a unix stack and 
should do the right thing.

Magnus has magnanimously traced the conflict. Xitami opens a lot more 
ports than just 80. My reading is that some of these are opened without 
specifying an IP. The default is &quot;all&quot;, the first copy already snagged 
those ports, the request is refused, Xitami suspends itself.

Is it a bug? Since you CAN run MANY different IP addresses on a single 
copy of Xitami, demanding to be able to run two copies seems greedy. 
(Specially for free.)

Yet clearly there is IP:Port support; just somehow not on the LRWP 
frill. Probably an oversight by the developer. Well, it IS a technology 
demo, not promised to be all things to all people. And it appears the 
community didn't notice this oddity for many years; how &quot;essential&quot; can 
it be?

Xitami NT-Service source code IS available. And it is darn clean stuff. 
Knowing the bug location, any half-fast C programmer should be able to 
find the function call and the oversight. (Or, since &quot;nobody&quot; uses LRWP, 
simply lose the whole LRWP call.)

Nearly a decade ago, I was able to build Xitami from source. I'm not so 
clever anymore, or I've grown smart enough to have lost all my MS-C 
compiler disks.  I'm a user, not a coder. Do we have any coders here, or 
just users? And coders who want to spend time on this odd-horse problem?

I think the xitami.wikidot.com site says it all. There are NO edits, 
ever, not even the glaring typo in Pieter's introduction (&quot;not&quot; for 
&quot;now&quot;). I just fixed that, and added Magnus's comments.... but 45 days 
with __NO__ community input means nobody has an oar in the water.
