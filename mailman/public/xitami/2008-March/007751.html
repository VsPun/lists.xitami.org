<PRE>I just tried it with 192.168.1.2 port 80 and 192.168.1.18 port 80. I can
start one but not the other. Xitami loads both instances but one doesn't
start even though it says that it's started. I'm not sure what's stopping it
from running tho?  

 

I have 28 IP addresses loaded on this NIC. Virtual sites on one Xitami work
fine. 

 

I don't know maybe I missed something?

Paul,
 
Thanks.  This is the kind of info I was looking for.  Port 80 is dependent
per IP as its a tcp issue.  I checked 'netstat -na' and see only see Port 80
bound to the first server.  There is no other port 80 on any of the other
IPs on the NIC.  Currently the second IP has port 5080 bound to it which is
what I had to set that second server to just to come up.  But changing that
second server back to port 80 prevents the service from starting.
 
The NIC currently has 3 IPs, each IP serves different sevcies (dns, smtp,
pop, http, etc).  I am using Windows Advanced Server 2003 and was pretty
certain that I previously did this type of configuration but couldn't recall
if I ran both IPs with port 80 or one on port 80 and the other on another
port.
 
Can anyone else test this for me to see what results you get?  Simply add
another IP to your nic, stop your xitami service and copy the xitami folder
to a new folder (otherwise the defaults.cfg file will get corrupted in the
copy), change the defaults.cfg server IP to the new IP of the nic and change
the Xitami Service Name, and then start the both sevices from both xitami
folders.
 
Can you connect port 80 on both IPs?  Will the second sevice even start up?
 
In the meantime I am checking to see if there are conflicting config files
in either of the folders that I am currently using.
 
Thanks all.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You have one NIC. It has one Port 80.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No. The NIC doesn't even know what an IP is, much less a port. If it 
</I>&gt;<i> gets a packet it passes it to the TCP/IP service. This examines the IP 
</I>&gt;<i> and port, checks a list of what programs have requested to bind to what 
</I>&gt;<i> IP:port combinations, and passes the packet to the program indicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It isn't a hardware thing. We know that multiple webservers will work 
</I>&gt;<i> over one NIC. A second NIC is not the answer and sure will confuse you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible you found an oversight (bug) in Xitami or your TCP/IP
</I>demon.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO it is far more likely a configuration error. Xitami has many ways 
</I>&gt;<i> to find configuration data. The default bind is to &quot;All IPs&quot;. My 2 cents 
</I>&gt;<i> says there is another .CFG file which is binding all IPs to the first 
</I>&gt;<i> copy which starts, leaving the second copy stranded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Use 'netstat -an' to see what IP:ports are &quot;Listening&quot;. Since the basic 
</I>&gt;<i> netstat may not indicate -which- program is listening, see what it says 
</I>&gt;<i> when each server is started alone.
