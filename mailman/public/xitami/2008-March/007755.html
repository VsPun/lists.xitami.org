<PRE>Ok let's analyze this a little. Your PC gets an IP address either static or
dynamic. If you don't have a router then all traffic to that IP address
whether it is Http (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21) or eMail (port
25) ***if memory serves me on my ports*** is sent to your PC. (well even if
you do have a router) You have one port 80, so any traffic is routed to that
port. Even if you set up many IP Addresses bound to that one NIC card you
still only have one Port which is why with one click of a button you can
shut down all web traffic with your firewall software. I have 28 virtual IP
Address on my server however if I shut down port 80 all sites are shut down.
Even though I have 28 IP addresses everything still comes in on the one main
IP address and port 231.123.234:80. When you type myfakewebsite.com a domain
name server somewhere will translate it to my IP address. Notice that it
already has port 80 which is assumed (meaning you don't have to type that
in) with http. Now once that web address (URL) is at the PC it's up to the
software (Web Server) to figure out what to do with it. Now how am I able to
use 28 IP Addresses? I run DNS server software on the same PC as my Web
Server which does nothing with Ports it just translates a domain name to an
IP address. Only one IP address is PUBLIC all the rest are PRIVATE. The only
way I could see more than one port 80 is by having more than one NIC card
and more than one PUBLIC IP Address. Multiple NIC cards Multiple Port 80's. 


Now am I missing something?

Bogus is a bad word!  There is NO bogus with Xitami, it just works, you 
need to have more understanding of TCP/IP and Ports....

Google is there USE IT!
