<PRE>I used to use xitami, and had multiple servers. It was a while back but I
think I used the multiple IP approach so that anyone not knowing fine
details of my setup could use ordinary browser commands.

1. you can set xitami to listen on ports other than 80 in defaults.cfg
   ipaddress=*

#   Defines the IP port base for the server. Add 80 to this to
#   calculate the actual port used for the HTTP service. For example,
#   to run the server on port 6080, define portbase as 6000. We use a
#   portbase in place of an absolute address so that multiple
#   protocols (e.g. the FTP server embedded into Xitami) can be
#   managed as one unit.

2. but there is only one port x, whatever webserver or other app you have
told to listen on port x, and whatever port x you have chosen. I have not
been reading all the posts but I suspect that what the user is trying to do,
is better done by setting up virtual servers also in defaults.cfg

#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   VIRTUAL-HOSTS configuration section
#
#   This section lets you define virtual hosts. A virtual host can be
#   specified in two ways: by IP address (if your system has multiple
#   IP addresses) or by name (if your system has multiple names). To
#   define a virtual host, specify the virtual IP address or host name
#   and the name of a configuration file .

[Virtual-Hosts]

#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   FILTER configuration section
#
#   This section lets you define filter programs. To define a filter,
#   specify a file extension with a leading dot and the filter
#   command. The command may be with a full path, or without, if the
#   program is on the PATH.

3. before anyone tells me that there is no defaults.cfg in their
distribution, I know that. You create it yourself to override the settings
in xitami.cfg - if you have ever bothered to read the docs. (it took me 2
minutes to download xitami again and remind myself)

4. Guess what - if you have the server running on a port other than the
standard 80, a remote browser has no way of knowing it automatically.  To
access the server you have to call up the page with the port specified e.g.
<A HREF="http://my.server.com:x">http://my.server.com:x</A>

That being said, while xitami suited my purpose for a while, there were some
facilities I wanted (or some problem with one of my favorite tools) that
caused me to switch. The server I use now has a nicely presented web admin
(and guess what for admin you call it using the different admin port!) that
more or less leads you through without looking up the documentation. Web
searches are good.

Apologies if reading only the last couple of posts I misunderstood where the
questioner was coming from.

there is ONLY one port 80 man!  Per NIC/Router/Linux Box
Man the documentation is right on Xitami's website, or even better buy 
PRO and get the full support, you need it!
