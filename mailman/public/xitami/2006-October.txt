Okay something else strange.

I decided to try loading Xitami as a service on a server where I have been
running xigui32.exe. Once started now I get different pages, I'm not sure
what yet but I'm investigating. Shouldn''t I get the same pages?

Looks like everything is pointing to the root of the webpage directory vs
what's in the cfg. For instance if I have
d:/xitami/webpages/domain.com/index.html  instead I get
d:/xitami/webpages/default.html

Subject: [Xitami] Posible Conflit with Tor's Proxy
Message-ID: <009601c6fcc7$82aff960$6801a8c0@earthlink.net>

Dear Friends,

    I have a grayhat situation:

    I have a Cobut Server that a hacker has found a way to use to send out his spam though. I have finger out most of what I need to do to stop him. But I believe that it will only make him more persistent to find another way to use my server. So I need to take this opportunity to learn how to make my server more secure. One of the thing that I have learned is that most hackers use  a system to "Tor" to Protect there identity. So I need to install a copy of Tor on my Local computer (which also had Xitami) so I can learn how it works, what the effects on my Cobut Server are so I can learn how to identity its use, and if there is a way I can defeat it.

    HEAR IS MY PROBLEM.

    I was just about to install Tor on my Computer When I noticed that there Privoxy 3.0.3 (witch is part of the Tor packeg) Happen to work like a server and used Localhost, and the ip 127.0.0.1, the same address my Xitami uses, (See instructions for yourself http://tor.eff.org/docs/tor-doc-web.html.en) . Now my question. Will there be a conflict between Xitami and the Provoxy, and if so dos anyone know how to move the Provoxy out of the way, Since Xitami if Primary on my machine and I have written dozens of script referring to Xitami as the Localhost.


Sincerely,

Stefan

Subject: [Xitami] PHP problems on Xitami server on local machine
Message-ID: <45471285.2050207@telinco.co.uk>

I don't know whether this is a problem with php 5 or with xitami server.

I want to use a variable that changes from site to site/directory to 
directory; this seems to have worked in a previous incarnation of php 
with xitami. I would define the root directory with 
"http://localhost/thissite" and things seem to have worked.

Unfortunately, if I use the $_SERVER variable now I get the result 
"localhost/webpages/thissite". However, this result does not bring up a 
page the browser can find. Somehow "webpages" is being delivered. This 
makes a mess of any automatic referral to other pages.

If I add "http://" to this new variable created with the $_SERVER value, 
no page is served up, in fact Xitami seems to take a long time trying to 
figure what is being asked. Without the "http://" the rogue value is 
brought straight up. Even if I make up the variable with what I know to 
be a valid address, anything with the "http://" fails as a variable, if 
I use this variable without the "http://" in a header nothing happens.

I am stumped. Any ideas? Thanks for your help in advance.

Regards,
Stilman Davis
