<PRE>Thanks Gordon.  It seems to be working.  I think the [Mime] line must have
been working before but I was looking at cached copies of my pages.  Good
find.

  I am using Xitami 2.4d10 under Windows 2000 Pro and had been fighting for
months with how Chrome (only Chrome) completely ignored external css files.

  But all was fine after I told Xitami yesterday that .css files were of
type text/css in defaults.cfg:
  [Mime]
       css=text/css

  Now it does not matter what &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; I use:
  - HTML 4.01 strict
  - HTML 4.01 transitional
  - XHTML 1.0 Transitional
  - even with a missing &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; line the external CSS works !


  My current working test site setup:

  HTML 4.01 strict in pages:
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;</A>&gt;

  In the &lt;head&gt; I specified charset:
  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;CHARSET=iso-8859-1&quot;&gt;

  In the external CSS the matching charset specification was the first line:
  @charset &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;;

  External stylesheet reference was:
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;../css/style.css&quot;&gt;

  How is your page wacky?  Can you confirm that 2.4d6 understands the new
lines in defaults.cfg ?

  I will send you the link to the working page.

    Gordon,

    This did NOT work for me.  I added the line in the defaults.cfg with a
    &quot;normal&quot; DOCTYPE and page was wacky.  Tried restarting Xitami.  No
change.
    Tried adding line to MIME section of xitami.cfg with and without a
restart -
    no difference.  For me the only thing that works is using a DOCTYPE of
    &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;

    Would you mind giving me the page address that now works for you.  I'd
like
    to see what you have in your CSS. Thanks.

    Phil

    Whoops - found the solution.  Now Chrome works with external
stylesheets.

    Edit defaults.cfg and add the two lines:

    [Mime]
         css=text/css

    I didn't even have to restart Xitami.

    I said:
    I have been having unreliable results with external stylesheets with
Xitami
    2.4d10 under Windows with Chrome browser.
    The same test site that fails with Chrome browser when served by Xitami
    works fine with Apache.
    I tried everything to do with DTD and @charset etc.
    Unless someone can identify why Xitami does this it's time to move on
...

    &gt;To Pieter (or anyone who might know)
    &gt;
    &gt;In searching for a solution to an issue I was having, I found a 1 Dec
2009
    &gt;post on Wikidot which indicated that if a DOCTYPE line was present that
    &gt;Xitami would not respect the formatting in the CSS file.  I am having
the
    &gt;same issue with both Safari and Chrome.  Pieter had suggested that this
was
    &gt;a &quot;pure HTML&quot; issue and encouraged the poster to ask the question in
this
    &gt;forum but I don't see that he ever did.
    &gt;
    &gt;In anyone's experience, is there a DOCTYPE that will work with Xitami
    &gt;(V2.4d6) on Safari and Chrome?  Or is there otherwise a solution?
    &gt;
    &gt;Thanks
    &gt;
    &gt;Phil
