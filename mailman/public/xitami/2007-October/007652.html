<PRE>hello,

i know it was asked here once before, how well xitami runs under vista... as
well as more recent questions about xitami's existence with dual and/or
multi-core processors, but i'm yet to see any follow-up.

i'm currently in a position where my main web-serving machine is
getting rather old and ragged, and i'm seriously considering replacing it
with something either new, or slightly pre-owned.  it seems that most of the
newer factory built pc's these days, are rolling off the line with
multi-core processors and win-vista pre-loaded... and though i have a
history of avoiding factory-built pc's, it may be the most cost effective
way at this point, to quickly get the most bang for my buck.

there is a great deal of confusion as well, picking and choosing between
vista home basic, vista home premium, vista ultimate... or the 32 vs. 64 bit
versions thereof.

i would kindly appreciate some feedback from those of you who may have
already tested xitami in these environments, and perhaps some comments and
suggestions on what i should be looking for to go the long-haul, trouble
free (as possible), while keeping my costs to a minimum.

thank you

rick
