<PRE>
Has anyone done any real world simulation or testing of Xitami?  I am trying 
to find a good load/stress testing tool (hopefully for free) that will allow 
me to bang the hell out of my server.  Anyone have any recommendations?

I would love to see users results to their stress testing by answering the 
following questions:
1) Hardware processor and memory:
2) OS Level:
3) How many users were simulated:
4) What was the duration of the test:
5) How many HTTP requests sent:
6) HTTP requests, Pass/Fail/No Response:
7) Server memory/processor utlizations during test:
8) Peak Bandwidth usage during test:
9) Summary and Comments about Results:

My first test results, though I don't know if my client was screwing up or 
the server or a combination of both:

1) Hardware processor and memory: 3.2Ghz Pentium 4, 2Gig
2) OS Level: Win Server 2003 - Enterprise
3) How many users were simulated: 2000
4) What was the duration of the test: 10 minutes
5) How many HTTP requests sent: 200,000
6) HTTP requests, Pass/Fail/No Response: 14,985/180,320/4722
7) Server memory/processor utlizations during test: 100% the entire time
8) Peak Bandwidth usage during test: 3% (total 47Mb transferred)
9) Summary and Comments about Results:  The server was slammed, without a 
doubt.  But it took 15,000 active sessions over 10 minutes.  So about 1500 
sessions per minute, 25 per second.  I don't think the &quot;single&quot; client I ran 
it from could produce that kind of load so the 180,000 failures could simply 
have been a big combination client failing AND server failing....not certain 
though.  I would imagine that the server would be able to handle a heck of 
alot more than 25 connections per second.  I am going to try to simulate a 
test from 5 clients spreading the load of 100,000 connections for a 10 
minute test to see if I can get better results.

My server is running Xitami and MySql and EVERY HTTP request requires a 
MySql call to retreive data.  I would love to know how some users tested if 
Xitami and there DB were on two seperate servers.

Hopefully this will generate some discussion, so feel free to add more info 
in beyond what I was looking for.
