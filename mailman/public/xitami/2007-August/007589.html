When running as a CGI, both Apache and IIS would handle it the same way. 
  However, Perl has both mod_perl (Apache) and Perl for ISAPI (IIS) 
modules available.

</I>
I was using PHP as an example.  And, as I said, I don't recall the load 
but it wasn't much.  See below for improvement ideas.


&gt;&gt;<i> you mass connect to a server in rapid succession (Windows hangs onto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> socket handles until TCP closes down cleanly or times out)...for my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> test, I wrote a tool to manage the process and just retried the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection on failure (i.e. it is almost always the client that fails to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connect because all sockets are in use).  Keep in mind that this test
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Client fails to connect because the client sockets are in use or the

</I>&gt;<i> Server is there away to increase buffers specfically for more web sockets to 
</I>&gt;<i> be created ?
</I>
Client sockets are in use.  Haven't run into the issue of running out of 
server sockets before.


&gt;&gt;<i> In theory, if you are using PHP, you should be able to drastically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve performance and security by using Xitami LRWP, multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instances of the ISAPI LRWP daemon (isapid - probably still a 'beta'),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the ISAPI PHP module.  Then, in your PHP code, use persistent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connections to the MySQL database (i.e. mysql_pconnect()).  LRWP, IMO,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a weak protocol - it can only handle one request at a time.  For the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load you describe, 10-12 instances of the ISAPI LRWP daemon will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably be sufficient.  The server will still be hammered but should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to handle the load.
</I>
The above applies to &quot;Perl for ISAPI&quot; as well.  Apparently ActiveState 
includes a closed source ISAPI filter with their Perl distribution. 
However, as far as I know, Perl doesn't have a mysql_pconnect() 
equivalent - so you'll be hurting performance in the database area.
