<PRE>I have since learned its not a Xitami issue but it is a problem related to
the browsers.  IE/NS and FF all do the same thing and call the URL twice to
the iFrame.  I don't know why or how though.  The best I have been able to
research is that it has something to do with httprequest processing the URL,
then the a second time to pass it the iFrame.  Or rather vise versa - the
first run of the script writes the correct printed variables to the browser
window, but then the database always shows the count one higher than it
should be, which means the second run of the script isn't getting passed to
the browser - but something else is calling it and causing the script to
execute a second time.

Not many documented cases (google search) of people discovering this problem
and I haven't been able to come up with a fix.  But this problem can be
replicated using iframes anywhere.  I have been trying to get others to
create a test page with an iframe to replicate what I have found, and then
check their web logs to see that one click to the iframe is calling the URL
twice.

Because I am using this method as a client side statistics counter (written
to a db), my numbers are double what they should.  I suppose I could always
divide by two to get the accurate number, but I don't like the fact that the
URL (a script) is getting executed twice - processor and memory usage
becomes a problem during heavy loads.

Russel,
Xitami does no JavaScript or Frame processing whatsoever. It's pure client
side technology.
Can it be that your browser so smart, that it remembers that content of
IFRAME is no longer &quot;blank.htm&quot; and while rerendering page calls IFRAME with
new CGI URL... again?
