Xitami ain't reading any script. It passses the request from the client to 
php and returns the answer from php to the client. It doesn't give anything 
about what is being returned from the script-running program php.

The problem with your settings-index.php is the relative URI, a problem we 
discussed here earlier this day. Change it to an absolute URI and it'll work.

I come to think, that maybe apache is correcting the 
non-specification-conformant HTTP-header field returned by php. Does anyone 
know about this aspect of the guts of apache? Would be interesting.

Hope this helps,
tony
