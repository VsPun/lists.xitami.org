Subject: Re: [Xitami] Assertion failed (continued)

I doubt this is the same issue but I will lend my comments none the less.  A
few months back I ran into a problem with CGI STDIN that wouldn't allow me
to retrieve uploaded files one buffer at a time - Xitami held the whole
uploaded file in memory before releasing it to the hard drive.  I was
writing a Progress Meter script to show users the progress of their uploaded
files so they wouldn't think anything hung or timed out.  In order to do
this you need to write the input buffer to a file, then every two seconds
(or how ever often you wanted) read the size of that file , a second script
would run using an html refresh and check the progress/size of that file and
increment the progress bar.

Xitami held the entire STDIN buffer before writing to the file...so with a
1000K file to be uploaded, the local file size literally went from 0 to
1000K (when done) even though the buffer was reading 1K at a time.  The
progress meter would start and show the file size as 0....and stay at 0,
then 20 seconds later it suddenly flashed 1000K and showed the file upload
as finished.    I was always able to retrieve the total file size from the
CGI $ENV{CONTENT_LENGTH}, but the buffer simply wouldn't write to the local
file until the entire file/files had completed their upload.  I even tried
to reading the TEMP files that are natively created via the CGI and
monitored their progress during the file uploads.  The same thing occurred.

I installed Apache, ran the identical upload and progress meter scripts and
it worked perfectly....I saw the same 1000K file incrementing in batches of
75k per second via the progress meter.

So, as mentioned before, I doubt this issue is the same but the fact that
you were working with CGI STDIN and STDOUT and were having (buffer?)
problems I thought I would bring this up.  Unfortunately for me, in order to
have this simple little progress meter for my users I have to have Apache
installed and run my upload scripts on the Apache server...I am still
sticking with Xitami but at the moment thats all I am using the Apache for -
a progress meter!

No, you can use the executables provided for Windows.
