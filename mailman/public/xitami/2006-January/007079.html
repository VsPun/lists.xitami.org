</I>&gt;<i>So, are you saying the CGI simply invokes the Perl compiler after passing 
</I>&gt;<i>the parameters to the script?  Then once the Perl is invoked it will 
</I>&gt;<i>continue as a seperate process even if part of that process is to 
</I>&gt;<i>kill/restart the Xitami server?
</I>
I am not using Perl at all. I write all my CGI's in pure VB 5 or 6 code.
The CGI I made I called RefreshServer.exe and all you need to do is call it 
and on run, it shuts down the machine and reboots it.
I of course added the Xitami to the startup sequence or as a service auto 
start then it works fine.


&gt;<i>Why are you still even trying to run the Xitami FTP server.  It is a well 
</I>&gt;<i>documented buggy server application that the Xitami folks stopped 
</I>&gt;<i>development on years ago.  If you start Xitami, absent of the FTP server, 
</I>&gt;<i>you shouldn't have any problems with Xitami hosing up on you all the time.
</I>
I have not really had any troubles with the FTP server part except for the 
fact that if the client accessing it is having some kind of FTP app not 
dedicatedly made for the proper environment, then errors happen.

WS_FTP free version works fine on Win 95, 98, NT4  and 2000 but not XP or 
2003 because WS_FTP was made for an older winsock.
The new one shouldn't have a problem but I have not tried it.

Cute FTP clients in free mode have a problem on XP too.

Linux FTP works just fine, I tried it from my linux can and its working as 
fast as ever.

Windows FTP doesnt work at all.
