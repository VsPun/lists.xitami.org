<PRE>Hello again all,

Here is an email I recieved from someone on a forum I have that uses phpBB2:

&gt;<i>Your site is trying to access odd ports each time I try to login to the private message section.
</I>&gt;<i>The ports appear to be somewhat consecutive, but not are not standard web ports afaik.
</I>
&gt;<i>Source..
</I>&gt;<i>(ip addy removed) port range: 63460-63512 and counting
</I>
&gt;<i>Destination port range: is all over the place, mostly in the range of 1000 to 4000
</I>
Can someone collaborate on this for me and present a fix that will work
to keep people from having loggin issues on my site. Last week I wrote
that some people were having refresh issues and this could be one reason
they are having the roblems.

Thanks in advance

</PRE>
