How can you say so much without saying anything, i think the xitami is a
very good webserver, but this forum is shite, i don't want a long convo i
would just like to know how can i test and develop chat/forums etc... most
scripts tell me i need to change permission, i don't need you tell me that
they are wrong, i have ran a chat site for two years and that is the way i
did it, so can you help YES or NO Thank you.

Mike
