It's also totally illegal if the &quot;subscriber&quot; resides within an EU state;
moreover, the forum's owner would be violating a law for which
extradition may exist, and is punishable by a fine of up to half-a-
million euro (that's well over USD600k) and/or five years' imprisonment.

SFAICS, we're FAR better off with the present arrangement of this mailing
list...

    &quot;We can no longer stand apart from Europe if we would.  Yet we are
    untrained to mix with our neighbours, or even talk to them&quot;.
