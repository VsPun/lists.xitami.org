<PRE>Sorry but i don't think you know what you are talking about, to be able to =
run a forum or chat room, using a 'flat file' the user need to have =
permission to write to a file where they messages are stored, this is not =
done automatically, once the file have been uploaded to a server the =
permissions need to be changed, i would love it if you can prove me wrong, =
and direct me to an example or a demonstration where this is not the case.

Thanks

Ps What is the point of this so called forum, i thought it was to help =
with xitami so far i have not recieved any and i am about to unscribe.

I am so disapointed that you can make of my spelling what you will

Hello Michael,

On Thu, 06 Nov 2003 12:32:09 +0000 your time, you said:

MG&gt; Easier  said  than  done,  i  have tried using cuteftp but i get a
MG&gt; message  command  not  implemented....

Well  I  wouldn't  do  that  just  yet. If you are running Xitami on a
Windows OS you don't do anything. CHMOD isn't supported, and you don't
need to set permissions, usually. It should work OK as is.

I  have  CGI forums setup under Xitami on a W2K Pro machine and didn't
need to set any permissions for the files, so I imagine the same would
apply for your script.

 Simon @ i~n+f~o+w~i+z~a+r~d+.~c+o~.+u~k
