Hello Marc,

On Sun, 02 Nov 2003 19:25:47 +0100 your time, you said:

MD&gt; I think it's clear by now that a majority is in favor of some sort
MD&gt; of messageboard instead of this list

You  obviously  have  a  bias in favour of message boards as I see the
opposite  as being true. It seems to me that the majority on this list
are in favour of continuing with it, including me.

Trawling  boards  is  time  consuming.  I know that because apart from
using  a  lot  of  web  boards in the past I used to run my own public
forums.  Each  have their merits, but on the whole forums lose out big
time  because  they  don't  provide  the same quality of response that
mailing lists do.

It  would  be  a  big mistake to drop list support in favour of forums
IMO.  Forums  should really serve to support and compliment this list,
not replace it.

MD&gt; (could we hold a referendum=3F)

Why  exactly=3F  If  people  that  prefer lists stay here and those that
don't go it would save all this prolonged nonsense. This 'should we or
shouldn't we' dawdling isn't helping anyone, or this list.

Sl=E1n,

 Simon @ i~n+f~o+w~i+z~a+r~d+.~c+o~.+u~k
