<PRE>OK.  Is your machine behind ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) or a
router or is your machine connected directly to the internet? =20

  Hello Daniel,

  No, I have nothing on the XP machine, other than whatever may be built

into the O/S itself..  I simply downloaded into a clean machine, ran the

Windows install, and it appeared to be set up right!  And if I were the
only=20
one testing it, I still would not know otherwise, because as I
mentioned, it=20
is accessable to me, using all methods!!   Yes, Daniel, they have tried=20
&quot;every&quot; way I know of.. They've tried: <A HREF="http://www.mysite.com,=20">http://www.mysite.com,=20</A>
www.mysite.com,  mysite.com, as well as the numerical address; ie:=20
xx.xx.xx.xxx and <A HREF="http://xx.xx.xx.xxx">http://xx.xx.xx.xxx</A> ..  &quot;ALL OF THEM&quot; to no avail..
And=20
yes, one friend  DID attempt to ping it, and it came back: unable to=20
establish connection, or failure to recognize..  &quot;?&quot; or something like
that!=20
  As if it were NOT there!!   I have always had such good luck with
Xitami=20
&quot;out of the box&quot; that this has thrown me for a loop!  Thanks allot
Daniel,=20
for ANY HELP you might be able to offer, so I can find out what I need
to do=20
to get my site online!  Have  a good day sir!

Are you running any firewalls or routers?  Are your friends typing in a
URL or an IP?  If a URL then do you have the URL mapped to your IP?  Can
your friends ping your IP?

  What a mistake this change was!  Is it even possible to get Xitami to
run=3D20
on XP home?  It installed fine, and I thought was going to run.   =
All=3D20
addresses point to it from &quot;my&quot; machine!  However NONE of the urls,=3D20
addresses point to my service from remote uses machines! Can anyone
please=3D20 help direct me to the problem?  It's hard because I have had
to get others=3D20 to keep trying to access my site, because I can type
localhost,=3D20 xxx.xxx.xxx.xx, the actual url,  and they all seem to =
work
just as well as=3D20 any I've seen..  But when others try it,, &quot;cannot
connect&quot;, and it's as if=3D20 it's not even there!  Thank you for any =
help
or advice you might offer! Have=3D20 a good day!
