<PRE>  What a mistake this change was!  Is it even possible to get Xitami to run 
on XP home?  It installed fine, and I thought was going to run.   All 
addresses point to it from &quot;my&quot; machine!  However NONE of the urls, 
addresses point to my service from remote uses machines! Can anyone please 
help direct me to the problem?  It's hard because I have had to get others 
to keep trying to access my site, because I can type localhost, 
xxx.xxx.xxx.xx, the actual url,  and they all seem to work just as well as 
any I've seen..  But when others try it,, &quot;cannot connect&quot;, and it's as if 
it's not even there!  Thank you for any help or advice you might offer! Have 
a good day!
