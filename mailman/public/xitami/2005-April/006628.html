<PRE>Ok I've run into something else.  I did a performance tests and Xitami 
defiantly performs better under a &quot;very heavy&quot; hit load.  Basicly I 
loaded Xitami along side Apache and moved our forums to the IP Xitami 
was using.  The users said they did noticed a big performance boost with 
the forums running under Xitami.  We're a voulenteer non-profit who 
hosts artists for free. So with no funding source except our bleeding 
pocket we need to make do with what we have.  Based on the performance I 
decided to move the bulk of our Apache virtual hosts over to Xitami 
(about 2,000 virtual hosts moved off  of apache).   Now Apache always 
seemed to take up about 90megs of ram (using dynamic virtual hosting).  
Xitami (on our P4 2400 with 1 gig of ram) took like 5 min to load at 
which point it ate about &quot;600megs!!&quot; of ram and then crashed the server. 

My question, is there any way Xitami will handle this kind of setup or 
is it too big or am I doing something wrong?

I am running the Windows console version under Windows 2003 Server.
My defaults.cfg loads virtualhosts like:

www.xxxx.xxx.org=usr/xxxx.cfg  (x2000 of these)

xxxx.cfg has:
[Server]
webpages=c:\webpages\artwork\xxxx
cgi-bin=c:\server\apache2\cgi-bin
log-dir=./usr-logs


I'm also worried Xitami eating that much memory will lose it's 
performance gain that it has when handling just a few vhosts.  Can 
anyone help fill me in better on doing this better (if there is a way)?

  Thanks   Gene
