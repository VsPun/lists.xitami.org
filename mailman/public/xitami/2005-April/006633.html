<PRE>&gt;<i> WHOA - Xitami has no future???!!!  Meaning the iMatix group won't be
</I>&gt;<i> further developing the Xitami platform?
</I>
Look at Pieter Hintjens post from 2004-10-06. I'll quote the two most 
relevant parts:

** begin quote
&quot;We spoke to the Apache team in 1999 and were happy to see that they 
were heading towards an architecture like ours: a portability layer, 
a bunch of protocol handlers, a fully portable server.  Today Apache 
2 is a fast, portable server and seriously: you should be using 
Apache 2 instead of Xitami unless there are specific things Xitami 
does better for you.&quot;

........

&quot;But... Xitami as a living product... it's clearly something who's 
time has come and gone.  The need for a small, fast, portable web 
server was painfully obvious in 1997-2000, and we are proud to have 
achieved what we did.  But today it's a niche product.  

We will continue to provide updates of Xitami, we will continue to 
publish the source code.  Other people may spend the time building 
binaries and nice installers - this is no longer our job.&quot;
** end quote

The server itself has hardly been updated in, like what, -- five 
years? Spare some DOS security updates. 2.5 has been in beta for that 
time, too. That's pretty sad, as it's a very, very fine product for 
what it does that would still be viable today if the 2.5 release was 
as stable as 2.4 and ISAPI or (less attractive) NSAPI was running 
like a dream (one would then not be bound to running parsers in CGI 
mode). But Imatix won't update their server, and no one has picked up 
the fallen token -- it is, after all, open source -- which pretty 
much makes the product dead.
