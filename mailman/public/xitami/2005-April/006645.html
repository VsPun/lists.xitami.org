<PRE>For some reason it handles perl pages MUCH faster in Xitami than 
apache.  Becouse of memory usage I am going to stick to apache for just 
our Forums and leave it at that for now.  It's roughly 1 meg size will 
work nicely for that and the speed boost.  Though something I've pointed 
out before.  I can't use any Xitami version greater than 2.4d9 .  The 
reason behind this is any version greater than that causes partial page 
loads to about 6% of my user base (that's a lot of users on my end).  It 
works fine for everyone else, but always fails for these same 
individuals no matter how often thay reload.  I hae no tbeen able to 
track down a common cause as of yet.
