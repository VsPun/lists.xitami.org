There is a 32k buffer defined in the code which does the file transfers 
(smttran), so that's probably involved.  It should transfer the file in 
chunks until it's finished.  Only transferring the first file... I assume 
you're not getting any errors in the console.log?  If you are up to changing 
the code, you can add traces (printf) to smttran.c at various points around 
lines 1102-1122 to see what's going on.

You might also want to try the 2.4 package - it's unlikely to behave 
differently but if it does, we may get a clue as to what's happening.

We don't have any OS/2 systems here (our last working OS/2 box died some years 
ago), so it's going to be rather hard to dig into this.
