<PRE>THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT HAS RESPONDED.  I FINALLY DID GET IT TO WORK.  THE
BELLOW INFO IS HELPFULL, SINCE IT ACTUALLY TELLS YOU WHAT NEEDS TO BE
WRITTEN IN ALL THE REQUIRED FIELDS.

WHAT HAD ME IS THAT I AM NOT USED TO PUTTING THE &quot;WWW.&quot; IN FRONT OF A DOMAIN
WHENEVER AN APPLICATION HAS A FIELD FOR YOU TO ENTER A DOMAIN.  I HAVE
ALWAYS ENTERED THEM AS &quot;YOURDOMAIN.COM&quot; WITHOUT THE &quot;WWW.&quot;


Create virtual host profile:      hostx.cfg (.cfg is assumed)
Select IP address:                  All Addresses (recommended)
Or, enter DNS host name:    www.yourdomain.com
Web Page Root Directory:    /Xitami/hostx/webpages
CGI-bin directory:                /Ximati/hostx/cgi-bin
FTP root directory:              /Ximati/hostx/ftproot
Create directories if necessary?  Checked

Whats important in the above example is that you make soft references to the
directory path using forward &quot;/&quot; slashes.  I tried using windows default
back &quot;\&quot; slashes and had problems.  I also made a hard reference using
&quot;c:\PATH&quot; and had problems too.  It seems Xitami even treats its configs and
Path references like URLs using the forward &quot;/&quot; slash.

I HAVE GOTTEN XITAMI TO WORK WITH THE &quot;\&quot; DIRECTORY.  MY DIRECTORY LOOKS AS
FOLLOWS AND SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE:

C:\XITAMI\WEBPAGES\MYVHOST\

SO FAR, SO GOOD.
