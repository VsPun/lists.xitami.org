<PRE>I just noticed that the SSI include tag (e.g. the one on the testssi 
page &lt;!--#include file=&quot;testssi.inc&quot;--&gt;) cuases the rest of the 
including document (e.g. testssi.ssi) after the tag not to get delivered 
if the included document itself uses SSI as the example include does.

SSI returns just fine if the included document itself does not try any 
SSI calls.

This is true using Xitami 2.5b5 (and 2.5b4) with NS6.1, 4.7 and IE5 and 
appears to be a xitami thing in that the HTML is in fact completely 
unfinished. I'm guessing that Xixssi doesn't deal well with the same 
page requiring 2 levels of return.

Also in the process of debugging and playing I noticed that Xitami has a 
limit on files with SSI includes of about 35,000+ bytes (one file 
displayed upto the 35922nd byte, another upto the 35553rd) and any data 
thereafter is abruptly truncated. The limit is not there for pure HTML 
files - I can successfully read 1Mbyte + sized .htm files but the same 
file renamed as .SSI will be truncated around this point even if it has 
no includes.
