<PRE>Hello all,

I've have installed the xitami web server on the following system:
windows98se / P75 with 32MB RAM.

I choose Xitami because PWS from Microsoft needed MS-Data Transaction Server
to be installed, and that was a little too much for the system :-)

Anyway, xitami seems to work fine. I am now trying to use a dynamic-host and
have subscribed at dyndns.org because I have a dynamic IP address.

Now to use dyndns.org, it is possible to install a client (several are
availble at dyndns.org), but it seems I could also use xitami for this,
right?
Now in html-admin, at the DDNS config-page, I see the following message:

'ddnsdef.xml' is not readable

The same problem for all other configuration pages: xml files are not
'readable'.

What can be the problem and how can I solve this? The problem is that every
change I make in the html-admin pages, are not 'saved'. They seem to be
saved at first when I click the 'save-icon' but when I refresh the pages,
the config is empty again.

Is the configuration stored in xml files? I thought it was stored in
xitami.cfg?

Thanks in advance,
Melle
