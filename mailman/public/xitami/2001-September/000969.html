</I>Maybe it send the mail to the html output file instead.

In addition, is there any way to get MAILTO to redirect the browser to a 
specific web page/URL after successful form submission (rather than have 
the entire page code included in the CFG file)?

There a at least two possibilities:
    - with javascript you can use a onSubmit=&quot;window.location.href=...&quot;
    - instead of generating a html page, you can send a Location: 
<A HREF="http://www.hdhdshsdhds-statement">http://www.hdhdshsdhds-statement</A> with two CRLF's
      and your client's browser will load that page.

A sendmail is a rather simple program, it only has to talk to a smtp server...
