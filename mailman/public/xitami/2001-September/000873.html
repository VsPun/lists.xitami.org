<PRE>In message &lt;<A HREF="mailto:3B94511D.C09F5A7@rci.rutgers.edu">3B94511D.C09F5A7@rci.rutgers.edu</A>&gt;, Paul Reid writes:
&gt;<i>My Xitami has worked fine for way over a year with little

</I>&gt;<i>logfile?) all written within a few minutes of each other
</I>
Numbering the suffix is Xitami's strategy for making thing unique when
it is renaming them, or otherwise needs a unique name.  It suggests that
possibly Xitami was resarting its logging a lot during the time period
in question -- possibly because Xitami itself was restarting a lot
during that period.  (Which it can be configured to do under Windows if
it has network issues, mainly to deal with people on dialup connections.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What is WSAESHUTDOWN and why am I getting bursts of them? 
</I>
WSAESHUTDOWN appears to be basically equivilent to the Unix EPIPE -- ie
indicating that a connection that was open before has been closed
(presumably by the other end) at some point between when it was last
seen as open and when the next read/write attempt as made.

In this case either someone is connecting to your webserver and
abandoning their connections before Xitami gets a chance to answer
(which seems unlikely given the clustering of them you got &quot;all at
once&quot;), or something has confused Xitami or NT's networking into
thinking they've all closed.

If you haven't already tried the classic NT solution (rebooting) it's
probably worth doing to ensure the network stack has been reinitialised.

&gt;<i>(By the way: neither <A HREF="http://www.xitami.com">http://www.xitami.com</A> nor
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.xitami.com">http://www.xitami.com</A> seems to be working for me today: no response.) 
</I>
The xitami.com website is hosted for us by OpenAvenue (the Open Source
company); it appears that they're having some sort of issue with that
webserver.  I've sent them an email asking them to look into it.

Thanks for the report.
