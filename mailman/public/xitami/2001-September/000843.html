Hmm.  Normally when Xitami crashes out the error handler tries to print
out some information about which module it was in, and so on, which is
occassionally useful.

&gt;<i>Is there any information at all that I could get from these cores that might

</I>&gt;<i>problem, maybe it's peculiar to UnixWare.
</I>
The most useful thing to get out of core dump files -- assuming you've
left the symbols attached to the executable -- is a trace of the
functions on the stack at the time that it crashed.  That tells us both
a possible area where it is having problems, and also over the course of
a few crashes whether it's the same thing or a &quot;random&quot; thing causing
the problem.  (&quot;random&quot; problems are much harder to find, being
generally memory overwrite issues.)

&gt;<i>From memory under Unixware you'll need to use dbx to get a stack trace,
</I>unless you've installed (and used) the GNU compiler suite, in which case
gdb will probably work.  (The relevant gdb command is &quot;bt&quot;; I don't
remember off hand what the command is in dbx.)
