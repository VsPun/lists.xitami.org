Probably, it is has been so long ago I don't remember, but my guess is that you
could do it with notepad and then stop and restart xitami.

&gt;<i> Did Xitami automatically create the images, private and xitami

</I>
There is 1 subdirectory under e:\webhome\audctrl and I created it manually.
Under e:\webhome\arbor there is a \images subdirectory but I think I created it
and the other subdirectories were definately my creations.  I know of nothing
being automatically create in e:\webhome\audctrl.

&gt;<i> I am trying to keep everything related to a VH

&lt;snip&gt;
I'm deliberately using a common cgi, ftp, etc., but what you propose should
work, if you manually create the subdirectories and edit the virtualhost.cfg
file accordingly.  In my installation there are cgi-bin, doc, images, pcnadmin,
pcntest, session, and xitami subdirectories under e:\webhome that were created
by the xitami install.

FYI: t:\ftphome is on a physically separate machine.  The drive t: is a mapped
network share to another machine.  I do not run xitami as a service, thereby
allowing the connection to t: to occur before xitami is manually started (I
think this could be done automatically as a service, but starting xitami
manually is not a problem either and xitami doesn't get in the way if I doing
other maintenance on that box).

&gt;<i> Last question, do you have to create any kind of alias mapping (aside from
</I>&gt;<i> the host-vhx.cfg file) using the &quot;Aliases&quot; or &quot;VHosts&quot; sections.  I would

</I>
Only thing I know of is the contents of the 2 .cfg files.
