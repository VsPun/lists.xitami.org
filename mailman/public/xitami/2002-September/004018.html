<PRE>    Ever since I have installed PHP for OS/2 I have noticed some occasional odd 
behaviour in Xitami.  I am wondering if there there may be a setting I need to adjust to 
get this running smoothly?  I recently upgraded my server to a K6-2 550 to speed up 
some PHP apps mainly thumbnail creation with GD and faster reloading in the 
occasional server reset.  I use smartbar.exe to see what threads are doing what and 
using what % of cpu time.  I've noticed two different effects.  

When I run a php script photo frame (photoframe.sourceforge.net) PHP loads and uses 
about %60 of the cpu time generating thumbnails and then exits.  About 1 in 4 times 
Xitami roughly several seconds later spikes taking %100 to 99.6% of the cpu time for a 
couple seconds to sometimes as long as two minuets.  During this time Xitami times out 
on all connections.  Also about 1 in 4 times Xitami stays at about .3% to .6% cpu 
utilization but still refuses connections for roughly the same time frame.

Are there any timeout settings I need to be careful with?  Or something possibly 
interfering with Xitami?

Thanks Gene
