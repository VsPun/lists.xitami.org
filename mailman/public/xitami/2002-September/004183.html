<PRE>Howdy All,

I'm getting the following errors in my Xitami crash log on one machine
in my basement which runs 24/7 unattended. 
The machine generates and stores log reports for a number of web sites
and Xitami is only used to view the reports. 
Therefore it may go for days without any calls to Xitami.

222mhz P2 dual processor which was running Win2k sr2 at the time of
first occurrence.

When the errors first began I was running version 2.5b5, so I backed up
to version 2.4d6 with the same results. The first several incidences
shown below repeated about 100 times a second for about 5 or 6 seconds
before it was shut down. This went on several times a day for about 2
weeks. Then I let the machine run without Xitami for a week or two. 
I believe sr3 was installed between the 1st and 2nd examples. At least
the machine now has sr3 on it. (automatic updates) The 2nd and 3rd
examples are more recent and were only repeated a few times before being
shut down. Sometimes, the internal Xitami system reports the bug and
shut itself down as I find the errors on screen. 
The silent recovery system does not recover.
Other times Windows kills the process with no Xitami error reported
either on screen or in the crash log. Any Ideas as to what is causing
this and what to do about it? 
I've run Xitami for years with no problems until about 2 months ago.
