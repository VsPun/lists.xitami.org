Hi. =)  Silly newbie questions..  My webservice provide just installed php and mySQL on his Xitami server. I 
have two scripts that I want to run. 

One is a content managent system and the other is an image indexing program called gallery.  Both programmes 
will run in both UNIX and Windows.  I'm only familliar with UNIX servers and &quot;chmod&quot;ing files to make them 
executable.

I get this error message:  &quot;Bad request: probably tried to POST a non-executable URL&quot;  I did a little digging 
in to the lists archives and I've found reference to perl scripts being executable from the cgi-bin directory.  
So, I made a cgi-bin and uploaded the files there.. I use the same path as the ftp, but I get this message: 
&quot;The URL you asked for does not exist on this website.&quot;  I suppose I need to be given access to the cgi-bin?   
Well I suppose my question would be: are php scripts executable from the cgi-bin? 
 
I downloaded Xitami and installed it on my computer and have been trying to get php installed--but it's not 
working.
