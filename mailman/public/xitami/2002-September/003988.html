Subject: [Xitami] Xitami, ActivePerl CGI Scripts Not Working


This is a follow-up to my previous post requesting help with the subject
combination. In the first post, I listed the content of a simple web page
passing a short string to a simple CGI script. I very probably should have
stated this the first time around, but the page and script work fine if the
script is served from the web server provided by the author of the book
where these beginner examples are published. So, I don't believe the script
itself is the problem.
I have tried some suggestions offered by helpful people with the following
results:

&quot;Put the complete URL of the Web Server being asked to serve the CGI in the
action line of the web page.&quot;
Works correctly if I use the book author's URL, still fails when I try to
use my local Xitami installation (get a blank page)

&quot;Active Perl only interprets .pl files, not .cgi.&quot;
Changed the extension of animal.cgi to animal.pl. No difference noted. Still
get a blank page. If I change the extension on the simple, self-contained
script that *will* run, it runs equally well with either .cgi or .pl as the
extension.

&quot;Study the Xitami ducumentation for settings that might accect your
situation.&quot;
I've looked at the documentation for both Xitami and ActivePerl, and
(probably because I very inexperienced) don't see anything that looks like a
possible solution. ActivePerl *claims* to automatically configure Xitami
during installation, but I suspect the configuration is not quite complete.

Other symptoms noted:
Sometimes, after a failed attempt to call a CGI from a web page, the Xitami
icon in my system tray has changed from green to yellow. On other occasions,
the icon is still green after a failed attempt, but Xitami has &quot;stopped
responding&quot;.
Other things tried:
I have syntax checked the offending scripts in Perl and no errors are
reported.

I'm probably not describing all this very well, so if there is other
specific information needed for further analysis, please tell me and I'll
try to get it.

Any suggestions much appreciated!
