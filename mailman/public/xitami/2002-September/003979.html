<PRE>  Hey all,

  You all answered my question a while back about being able to password 
protect more than one section of the site, but I have another question 
please.  I need to be able to allow each member to have thier own page, and 
only &quot;their&quot; password would get them there. The way I see xitami supporting 
passwords, is that as long as you have a u/name and p/word, you can get into 
&quot;all&quot; protected areas.  It would be really great if I could have only one 
link to the log-in, and each members password would direct them to their 
page.  However, I can get by with giving each member their own link to the 
log-in script.. Is there a fairly easy way of doing this? Thanks to you all, 
you are all very helpful to everyone! Have a good day!

  John
