<PRE>At 08:30 AM 10/14/2002 -0500, Peter van der Goes writeth:
&gt;<i>As I was the original poster of the script example which included the
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;3D&quot;'s, I am very interested in this explanation. At the time, I thought the
</I>&gt;<i>spurious characters had something to do with me posting in HTML. Long after
</I>&gt;<i>the original incident, I discovered that all the example files from the
</I>&gt;<i>original source were riddled with &quot;solid black rectangle characters&quot; (when
</I>&gt;<i>viewed in Notepad) which had to be removed before the examples were usable
</I>&gt;<i>in a Win 2000 environment.
</I>&gt;<i>I suspect the mysterious appearance of the &quot;3D&quot;'s in my post and the
</I>&gt;<i>rectangles in the original files are related somehow. The files came
</I>&gt;<i>originally from a Perl book author's web site, and (I believe) were designed
</I>&gt;<i>to be run on a Unix-based web server. Subsequent to all this, I have
</I>&gt;<i>discovered that many other Perl authors provide separate script file
</I>&gt;<i>downloads for Windows vs. Unix. When I use example scripts designated for
</I>&gt;<i>Windows, I have no problems.
</I>&gt;<i>A colleague and I have discovered that if the original files are run through
</I>&gt;<i>a utility called Unix2DOS.com, then reversed through DOS2Unix.com, then
</I>&gt;<i>reversed through Unix2DOS.com *again*, the offending characters are finally
</I>&gt;<i>eradicated and the files are usable. I have also discovered that if these
</I>&gt;<i>original files are opened in WordPad, then saved with File-&gt;SaveAs to force
</I>&gt;<i>an overwrite, the resulting file is &quot;cleansed&quot; and usable on a Windows-based
</I>&gt;<i>web server.
</I>&gt;<i>I am relating all this in hopes of getting some practical insight on how the
</I>&gt;<i>files' originator (the book author) could have avoided all this in the first
</I>&gt;<i>place, as she appears to be as mystified by all this as I am. Should this
</I>&gt;<i>author be offering two sets of files, one for Windows-based web servers, and
</I>&gt;<i>the other for Unix-based web servers? Is there a better way?
</I>
Can I have a look at the original files?  Just send them to me off-list (I
only just started looking at this thread since I have only recently run
into problems like this).  I want to examine and see what problems there
are contained within.  If you want to, I would also like to see the
&quot;cleansed&quot; versions as well.  I will be able to provide a much better
explanation if I have the original files than if I did not.

Hope this helps!
