<PRE>The following are some cut/pasted threads that concern the Xitami FTP 
service.....essentially, it sucks!  Very unfortunate too.  The Xitami FTP 
service has problems with NAT, Passive Mode, Proxy and connections from 
WinXP.  Obviously, all the development went into the kick-ass web service 
and zero development went into the sucky-ass FTP service.

The first one is my inital posting, and the rest are responses to that 
initail posting.  Take from it what you will:

===========================================================
I am running the latest release of Xitami Win2000 Server.  I am initiating
the FTP services with default settings, Port 21 and the same server IP.
When I connect to the FTP server from my location, I get connected but I
can't see any files or directories.

My work location is not firewalled but NAT is being applied from my client
side.  I see the connection, but the server isn't returning basic directory
listings or file listings.  When I shut down the Xitami FTP service on the
server and then initiate IIS FTP service, I can FTP just fine.

For some reason it seems Xitami can't communicate back to the NAT port my
computer is coming through.  But the IIS FTP service can.  Whats up with
that?  Anyone have any insights?

-R
===============================================
Don't use Xitami's FTP if it gives you any trouble. It's just a free
bonus in a free program. It's worth more than nothing, but is just
basic simple FTP. It hasn't been looked at since home-NAT became
common.

Don't use IIS _PERIOD_. Aside from being bug-bait, it likes to leave
bits of itself behind even when you think you've removed it. Maybe
it's what's blocking X's FTP.

There are a zillion cheap and free FTP servers. A dozen of them are
good. War FTP seems popular. Maybe someone will pop in with one they
like better.

-PRR
===============================================
I'm having ftp problems myself, but of a different nature.

What I noticed on Xitami, is that you need to have 2 ports open 20 (for the
Data Connection Port) and 21 are the default.  I switched to ports 1000 and
1001 because i thought my ISP might have been blocking port 21.

I am able to get to my ftp sites through computers on the network, but am
having very inconsistent results from outside my network that I haven't been
able to resolve yet.

Someone earlier wisely suggested forcing the IE ftp service to passive mode
through the tools/internet options menu.

fwiw, I'm considering switching to Apache or IIS because of this and other
issues I've had with X flaking out and crashing, but have significant
inertia working against that move.

mb
==================================================
Just so you do not think you are alone, I have the same problem - but
mine started when I added a router into the mix that uses NAT.  Prior to
that I used a software internet sharing package that worked fine.

I have found no solution so far.  I think the problem may be in FTP
wanting at least two ports, but why the software sharing handled it I do
not know.

I have been patiently (and unsuccessfully) waiting for responses to your
submissions.  I will copy Ewen in case he has ideas or the time to
respond.
