</I>&gt;<i> This works fine and isn't slow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messed-up SHTML url: www.graysoftenterprises.com/default.shtml
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This returns &quot;An internal Visual Basic error has occurred in
</I>&gt;<i> \default.shtml. File not found (error #53), GSECntr&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would say VB is getting called, but isn't getting some slice of
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Basic is _NOT_ a good language for CGI. Oh, I've done it and
</I>&gt;<i> got a paycheck. But I had to study the sample VB application that
</I>&gt;<i> came with Xitami to find out how to get the CGI arguments and STDIN.
</I>&gt;<i> MS BASIC and VB really don't like to do that.
</I>

The reason for that error output is my program relies on the argument
&quot;code=default&quot; to open a file (default.count) with a number in it.  I get
the file not found error because no arguments are making it to the program.
It's trying to open &quot;.class&quot; which doesn't exist.

It's slow because the server sends the html file to the client machine.  The
client machine reads the html and sends a request back to the server which
then executes the CGI and sends the input of the iframe back.  That is two
extra steps, which isn't too bad unless you look at it as TWICE the steps.
Just don't like inefficiency.  And I have a module that gets the STDIO just
fine (this is obvious from the working iframe).

This software isn't keeping records online, it's just a website to market a
client-side database application.  All the CGI really is is a counter I
wrote but more than anything I'm trying to get my feet wet in CGI.  I know I
can find generic counters, but the point is that this SHOULD work fine.

Surely someone out there has successfully executed a CGI with #exec cgi=&quot;&quot;
