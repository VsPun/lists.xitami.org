<PRE>I'm having ftp problems myself, but of a different nature.

What I noticed on Xitami, is that you need to have 2 ports open 20 (for the
Data Connection Port) and 21 are the default.  I switched to ports 1000 and
1001 because i thought my ISP might have been blocking port 21.

I am able to get to my ftp sites through computers on the network, but am
having very inconsistent results from outside my network that I haven't been
able to resolve yet.

Someone earlier wisely suggested forcing the IE ftp service to passive mode
through the tools/internet options menu.

fwiw, I'm considering switching to Apache or IIS because of this and other
issues I've had with X flaking out and crashing, but have significant
inertia working against that move.

Subject: [Xitami] FTP / NAT issues - is ISS better?



I am running the latest release of Xitami Win2000 Server.  I am initiating
the FTP services with default settings, Port 21 and the same server IP.
When I connect to the FTP server from my location, I get connected but I
can't see any files or directories.

My work location is not firewalled but NAT is being applied from my client
side.  I see the connection, but the server isn't returning basic directory
listings or file listings.  When I shut down the Xitami FTP service on the
server and then initiate IIS FTP service, I can FTP just fine.

For some reason it seems Xitami can't communicate back to the NAT port my
computer is coming through.  But the IIS FTP service can.  Whats up with
that?  Anyone have any insights?
