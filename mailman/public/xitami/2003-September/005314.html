<PRE>Tom:

For some reason your server refuses my message, so I am writing again to the
list.

Regarding the code

 &lt;?php
 header (&quot;Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT&quot;); // Date in the past
 header (&quot;Last-Modified: &quot; . gmdate(&quot;D, d M Y H:i:s&quot;) . &quot; GMT&quot;);
 header (&quot;Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate&quot;); // HTTP/1.1
 header (&quot;Pragma: no-cache&quot;); // HTTP/1.0

It MUST be the very first thing written to the page, otherwise you will get
a &quot;header already written&quot; error, so it is a good practice to put it right
up at the beginning of the code.
If you haven't written the program, (and by the way I don't know the
application you mention ) you could try looking at the page name that is
being cached and not refreshed, and edit the corresponding php file and add
these lines at the very top.

You would not need to add this to php files that only do internal
calculations or otherwise are not involved in any html output.

Now, if you suspect that there is more than one file involved in the
creation of the page, I would suggest you add it to every php file that
generates html content, since it should not affect the performance of the
application.

You're welcome to post any other question just as each of us is. Let me know
how it went.

Take care and good luck,

Alejandro.
