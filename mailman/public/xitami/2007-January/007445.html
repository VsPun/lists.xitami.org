<PRE>In 2004 a friend helped me set up Xitami V. 2.5c1. Originally it was on Windows 98SE.  I upgraded to Win 2000 Pro.  I had saved the Xitami file and just reloaded it after installing the new O.S.  

The person who helped me set up lives in another state.  I am a bit confused with the program, and he didn't explain much of what he did when he set it up for me. 
It was working fine, even after installing the new OS, but starting late Dec I have had crashes. I have read your info but as I said, its a bit confusing for me.  

The program is on a computer that runs only one thing.  I use it as my server program for my world in ActiveWorlds.  The computer is dedicated only to that use, none other.  In our house we are networked with 3 computers, which runs fine.  

Since it started crashing, the computer isn't being used other than run continuously for the world.  (Other people can access the world, but only to 'walk around in it and look around&quot;)  I restart the program and then the next or two its crashed again.  Below is what I copied from the log:

23/Oct/2006:07:24:08 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1
Abort at smttime:Generate-Response-Events:expire old requests (Expect-Event, Timer-Event)
29/Dec/2006:11:47:48 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1
Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self: (Getting-Event, No-Activity-Event)
30/Dec/2006:15:29:38 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1
Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self: (Getting-Event, No-Activity-Event)
03/Jan/2007:20:34:33 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1
Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self: (Getting-Event, No-Activity-Event)

The program is set to restart automatically.  

Can you please explain to me what is happening and what to do, very clearly and simply?  I have computer knowledge, but when it comes to programs like this, its difficult.  And I am nervous about messing with something I don't understand well.  

thanks

Esther
