Subject: [Xitami] XITAMI, multiple domains and SSL
Message-ID: <017a01c8dc91$e0b5d240$8200a8c0@coleskingdom.com>

As I long time Xitami user I consider myself well versed in configuring
Xitami. However today I ran into a problem and have yet to figure out a
solution.

 

I have using XITAMI PRO running on a server serving web pages to multiple
domains for several years. Until today only one of the domains needed SSL.
I have been running the SSL for that domain for some time with no problems,
Today I purchased a separate second certificate for the new domain, however
today try as I could  I could not get XITAMI configured for SSL on multiple
domains. The instructions state that SSL is only supported for multiple
domains when using IP based domains I have tried to do this to no avail.

 

My configuration is as follows;

First IP ADDRESS XXX.XXX.XXX.251 handles ****a.com, ****b.com and ****c.com.


****a.com has its own certificate and key referenced in sslhttp.cfs (This
Works)

Second IP ADDRESS xxx.xxx.xxx.225  handles ****d.com and I have a
certificate and key for that domain already purchased  

I tested the certificate and key globally and they work so that is not the
problem.

Try as I might I could not get the correct configuration for domain
****d.com to reference the second certificate and key. Is there anyone on
the list that can help me with the correct configuration to make this work?
The SSL instructions included with even with the PRO version of XITAMI is
not very detailed.

 

Sorry for the obfuscated IPs and domains but we are a medical company and I
need to comply with HIPPA.

I am using Xitami Web Server v2.4d9 under Win32 and Linux

I am using the same version on Windows, but never have on Linux....if you 
are using PHP/Perl you can retrieve the cookies that way too and avoid 
depending on the server giving you the data.  In Perl, lookup the $ENV 
variable.

I believe Xitami Pro only allows you to have SSL running on the primary/real domain bound to the primary IP of the server and it won't work on virtual 'named' domains.  How exactly are you binding Xitami's multiple IPs to specific domains?  Are you depending solely on DNS - it won't work using DNS based hosting?

Read this info on Virtual Hosts: http://legacy.imatix.com/html/xitami/index8.htm#vhosts

1.  Physical server must have multiple IPs
2.  Xitami must be specifically bound to the desired IPs
3.  The virtual hosts section in the .cfg file must have IP to vhost associations
        ie: x.x.x.255 = d_domain.cfg
4.  You cannot bind named domains to SSL vhosts
        ie: www.***d.com = d_domain.cfg
5. Make certain your [Server] global configurations are not conflicting your vhost configurations
6. Use DNS to make certain www.d_domian.com points to x.x.x.225 IP address and that Reverse DNS is properly working, SSL uses Reverse DNS to verify authenticity.

Make certain the above is all in order and let us know if works out or not.

I use Xitami under Win32, OS/2 and Linux with Harbour compiler (Clliper
code) and my own model for scripts ( Clipxnet )
Values are retrieved with GETENV( "var" ), and for example GETENV(
"HTTP_COOKIE" ) return right content in Win32, OS/2 and empty with Linux

and set the Virtual Host IP in the Virtual Hosts section of the config but

When you install php, the windows version at least, it asks you for which webserver you are using - Xitami is one of the options and it should auto-config the Xitami .cfg file for you.  Otherwise, you will need to do it manually, which is pretty simple.

In the Xitami .cfg file, add the following lines in each of the stated sections:

[Filter]
    .php=c:\php\php.exe

[Mime]
    Php=application/x-httpd-php


Restart Xitami process and test a simple php script.  There are one or two security issues with the php configuration, in php itself, that you must fix to prevent your system from being left wide open.

   Xitami on Windows.

     Important for CGI users: Read the faq on cgi.force_redirect for
     important details. This directive needs to be set to 0. If you want
     to use $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] you have to enable the cgi.fix_pathinfo
     directive.

Its pretty simple stuff though.

R,

Thanks very much. I liked xitami when I had it set up on another 
machine, then i had apache on another machine.

I am trying to break in another machine and thought I would try it 
again. I knew I had seen some details somewhere, but I could not 
remember where.

Thanks very much for your help.

Stilman

It is really simple, I have it setup on one box here, but more 
complicated scripts require the power of Apache, it is free and 
supported.  Do not get me wrong, I have been an avid supporter of Xitami 
for quite sometime, 10 years or so now, and it is an excellent web 
server package, and damn fast!  ;-)  But for the heavy stuff I rely on 
WAMP....

vIsTa(TM) SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROPERLY MONIKERED: 'HASTALAVISTA'. BUT, ITS NO BIG DEAL AS FAR AS X SERVER, what you use as far as an OS goes, even SUN SOLARIS EXPRESS IS GOOD SINCE XITAMI STANDS ALONE without shared .dlls or resources. Things can and will only get worse re security while online once WinDOZE '9' becomes the OS of the day. ONE PROBLEM I USED TO HAVE WITH ANY MS OS was multi-threading while on the internet, visualise all these WinDOZE services and processes running and all these ports open while running a server as well as surfing the net, whilst checking email, ftp et al. then you have stuff running in the background-maybe some apps on the taskbar loaded but minimalized or even other windows goodies open for checking email, wheather, stock ticks or(...) So what we have here (presumabley-i am no expert) is a failure to communicate, reduce the start up programs, esp defender, ms firewall and any other googey products like AV, anti-spam or anti-malware, soft firewalls etc too are culprits-put them all in the bit bucket if you are serious about running any web server. Run only hardware firewalls/with online scans. Do a port check regularly, do online webpage checks to see what the bugs are in your pages, these are free as are online AV signature audits - check to see if your ISP allows you to have your own website, if you look at the template most ISPs use it is pretty standard that you are not allowed to use port 1080/80 for bandwidth on your own server pages(...)I wrote a E-book about Xitami once and noted that a server should be not only stand-alone but running as an exclusive app, not a service and not a start-up process. Shared resources, .dll, and other things get in the way of running a web server from within, from without, echo storms ping batch files, script kitties and a host of other exploits done by ISPs and by online users (HAX) also tend to shut X-Server down or run it off course so to speak...there are a set of basic minimalist procedures I wrote about to launch any home-built website using X; I could go on and on here but to be breif, just try to run your box with ONLY X server running, all ports closed except 31/80/1080 and go from there. Just some thoughts that you may consider, thx for asking!

i WOULDNT ADVISE RUNNING X SERVER AS A SERVICE. BUT THAT IS JUST, DUH-ME. I THINK DEAN MAY HAVE MISQUOTED [VIA TYPO] THE RESPONSE OF WINDOZE 'HASTALAVISTA' IN HIS POST-SCRIPT REPLY TO THE HDD ISSUE RAISED, THE ME SEQUENCE HE RECAPPED WAS: "

 "Why's it bloated you ask?"  
"...Because it's full of: 
WINDOZE: "Do you want to do this?"  ans.: ""Yes"" 
WINDOZE: "Do you REALLY want to do this?" ans.: ""Yes"" 
WINDOZE: "Windows thinks this is idea and HAS stopped it anyway" OPERATER: ""Darn..""

I RECALLED IT LIKE THIS: ... "Why IS HASTALA_VISTA bloated you ask?"  "...Because it's full of [THIS KIND OF TECHNOIDAL RUBBISH]: 

WINDOZE: "Do you want to do this?" ans.: ""Yes"" 
WINDOZE: ""Do you REALLY want to do this?"" ans.: ""Yes""
WINDOZE: ""OK, STAND BY WHILE I CHECK MY DATABASE-THIS MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO: ans.: ""snooooze"" 
WINDOZE: ""Windows thinks this is NOT SUCH A GOOD idea and HAS STOPPED THE PROCESS(s) anyway" OPERATER: ""Darn..""
WINDOZE: [HAL} AND FURTHERMORE... IF YOU TRY TO DO THIS AGAIN I WILL RING UP GATES, OR FOR THAT MATTER MR. BALMER DIRECTLY AND INSTRUCT HIM TO ECHOSTORM YOUR SERVER EVERYTIME YOU RUN IT AND PERHAPS EVEN GIVE YOU A MESSAGE ON YOUR DESKTOP: THIS IS NOT A REAL COPY OF VISTA AND THEN I WILL SHUT YOU DOWN FOR GOOD!"

Skip all they say about PHP-CGI

Use this to make it work..

In defaults.cfg  add the following...

[Filter]
#   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
.php="c:/php/php.exe"

[Mime]
    php=application/x-httpd-php


Change your default index settings as follows...

    default1=index.php
    default2=default.php
    default3=index.htm
    default4=default.htm
    default5=index.html
    default6=default.html
    default7=404.htm


In default setup of PHP 5 on Windows you should be aware of the following.

a)    $_POST[$VarName] WILL NOT WORK
       $_SESSION[$xVar]  WILL NOT WORK

they are turned off by default and should be so as well since they pose 
security risks.

b) The workaround for this is included below

(?2008 to myself)

<?php

A replacement function for $_REQUEST as this does not work at all out of
