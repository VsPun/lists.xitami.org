<PRE>Further hints on avoiding some error settings.

I installed and tried the 2.4 version again as was suggested here, 
and I came to the conclusion pretty quickly there are several 
differences between the 2.4 and 2.5
Something that will need further review before I decide to swipe my 
installation on  live server and move all my users around.

So, I reinstalled 2.5 and it took no more than 2 hours before the 
first crash showed up in it's default installation with FTP turned 
off and access logging on.

Now I found an interesting article which could be further helpful in this.

I included a snippet about this below for those interested.

Also see the article on <A HREF="http://articles.networktechs.com/91-p1.php">http://articles.networktechs.com/91-p1.php</A> 
for details on how to turn off error reporting.

I have already done this since earlier but so far left critical 
errors as flagged / checked. NOw I am trying without this check mark 
to see if the dwwin.exe might be a culprit as well.

To some individuals further annoyance, I will post one more message 
in this series of topics on the Xitami crashes, and that is as soon I 
have had time to create the tool/utility I am now working on called 
xitamiKeepAlive. Release of this should be later today, Sunday, but 
I'll reserve myself against any bugs coming up along the way.


dwwin.exe Application Error

One of the biggest things being searched for on this site right now 
is dwwin.exe. The reason for this is because it displays during quite 
a few common fatal error messages.

First of all dwwin.exe is Dr Watson which is used by the error 
reporting tool. Alot of security related applications will throw up 
warning flags about this file trying to read, write or modify a 
number of other .exe files. This isn't anything to worry about 
because it's only trying to investigate &quot;events&quot; that it believes is 
causing problems that may lead to crashing.

File can be found:
*:windowssystem32dwwin.exe

The biggest complaint about the error reporting service is it causing 
alot of various applications to not load or crash during use. Quite a 
few of these can be fixed by downloading updates from windows update 
and scanning for viruses/spyware but alot of others simply won't be 
fixed with the currently available updates. In that case you'll want 
to just disable the service! After that 90% of the time the program 
will then run properly. I have been telling people to disable this 
service in quite a few of my guides.
