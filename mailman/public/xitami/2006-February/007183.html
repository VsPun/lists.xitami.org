&gt;<i>First things first, stop calling every issue you have with Xitami 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;urgent&quot;. Every topic you have started cries wolf that way. Its not 
</I>&gt;<i>only annoying, its a good way to get ignored.
</I>
I have called two posted messages urgent, and both are referring to 
these crashes that suddenly became ever more frequent.
Having a site up (or 16 of them) and the server suddenly goes off 
line as soon you don't watch it, seems urgent to me, and more so to my clients.

However the many replies in this thread makes the topic stand out 
perhaps. I'll give you that.
If many replies and forwards of a certain thread is reason to ignore 
it, then that would be up to you.

As I said before, and as Peter also knows, I will likely send for a 
friend from Denmark after this semester is over and get to work on 
the source of Xitami.
As such, I'll be around in a whole different way, and hardly anything 
would seem urgent after that.

I also removed the Urgent word from the reply to this message, as it 
might please you a bit better too.
I will also of course follow your advise and pull a copy of the 2.4 
version to see if it will make a difference in this. It would be stupid not to.

Thank you for your advise.

- Mike
