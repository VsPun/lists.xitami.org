<PRE>Just a quick thought:

    My regular Xitami server (p166 orphan) runs flawlessly for months at a time, although I'm not pushing the traffic you guys are.  However, in order to add some disk space without having everything go down for a while, I moved all server stuff to an older computer (docked Toshiba 205 Laptop) with Win98SE and test ran it.  CRASHed overnight!  My working laptop is also a 205 and since I upped it to Win98SE, I crash regularly, usually with the network pc card installed but sometimes not.

  The best I can figure it is that somewhere a wakeup command doesn't process right and it locks up.  Usually the computer has been inactive for a long while (hour +) and has screen and disks timed off.  Sometimes it wakes up, sometime it doesn't.  Sometimes it went to sleep with IE on screen, sometimes not.  None of this seems Xitami related although an active TCP/IP connection is suspicious.  Running test right now without any software loaded.

I thought display drivers were involved but not.  Thought maybe a TCP/IP hangup (memory leak?).  Just not everything wakes up after a nap. ACPI maybe?  Power Management?

Hope this is helpful,

Charles

Configuration:
Xitami 2.5c2 (virtual host) on P166 (Win98SE) w/ 256mb, Php 4.something, MySQL something,
FD Daemon, Mercury Mail, AVGFree, ZoneAlarm.

  Very possible, but I have the same problem. it will crash after awhile and I don't know why. It may run for days before it crashes. I'm not real happy with the stablility. I'm running about 10 sites, I can site at the server all day doing any number of things, leave it alone for a hour and crash. Try to just restart it but it doesn't like that very much so a reboot is in order. But I can do a reboot then leave it for the weekend come back on monday and find that it crashed. Sure it might not be playing well with other services but that's a problem. It needs to play well with others.

  Anyway enough of my venting.

  Have a nice day!!!

  Now that could be a reason, but I have never had a problem with Norton before.
  In fact I have used this very same setup for years and never experienced as many crashes as recently.

  I am leaning more towards the large numbe of hits to different virtual hosts causing some overload and 
  xitami not being able to a) rotate the logs fast enough or b) not being able to route the traffic fast enough.

    &gt;  I turned off the FTP completely since I dont really use it for this current
    &gt; setup and I am looking to use an SFTP solution in a near future.
    &gt;  The FTP does not have any effect on this since It's all off.

    It is possible that some other software is causing Xitami to crash.  A
    common culprit is anti-virus scanners.
