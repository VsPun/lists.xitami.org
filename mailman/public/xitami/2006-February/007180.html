<PRE>Wiht the 4 and 5 branch I meant that I have tested2.4 and 2.5 in several releases, but they gave the same result.  I have p;osted on this discussion list questions about strange crashes but never got any answers. I too like compiled stuff in favor of php/perl, but my applications servers are fed by a very small perl script just passing data through to the app server and back. Under  certain circumstances (I realy do not know when )  the webserver crashes the same way you described. I also have a soap cgi applications (webservice built in Delphi ) running on Xitami giving the same results. Finally I noticed that the FTP part of Xitami is not stable at all. Being honest I was running Xitami for years just doing html stuff without any crashes at all. But since I was using  cgi applications and webscripting I simply couldnt get a stable environment. I'm using Apache now w.o. any problems,  but since Xitami is very easy to maintain (no difficult setup files), very small, I would surely like to use Xitami. But there's some isue here I couldn;t find. That's why I'm very interested in this thread because I hope to find out what I'm doing wrong or to find out it's a bug to be solved...

  I don't use MySQL at all. At least not yet, because I noticed that MySQL 5 builds up and steals 11 MB RAM just to not do nothing but sit there.
  I am not sure what you mean by 4 branch and 5 branch here. Please elaborate.

  I don't use Perl either because I like stuff that's compiled before I run it, and something I can manage to read after it was written /*chuckles

  I do however use a frequent amount of ADO and MSJet towards Access databases in CGI's made using VB.
  They do put a nice load on the server CPU but only for very short periods of time and 
  they don't affect the Xitami at all except for the execution time.

  In fact, I have one web site running on my server now, using one of my CGI's handling over 45,000 images, 
  viewer stats and image stats all from one file towards a single access database and they don't seem to have
  any problems whatsoever getting thousands of hits weekly. (20,000 page views in 2 1/2 weeks)

  Another web site I host is running straight forward HTML and just one JAVA applet and that bad boy
  is running up logs like crazy and sometimes takes for ever to load individual pages. Especially on the Java part.

  The only time I've noticed any trouble with the CGI is when there is Perl involved for some reason.
  Perhaps an interpreter issue in the back of it. I don't know and I am still waiting for my guru in Denmark to show up.

  I am not sure how SOAP would compare with that.

    I'm sorry if this post is off-topic, I'm currently following this thread. I too had problems with crashes and I didn't manage to solve this. I experimented a lot and the problem occurred both in 4 branch as in 5 branch. I was using Xitami within a perl  connection to an application server connected to MySQL. I have seen posts here that MySQL settings had influence on the working of Xitami, but the crashes occurred very irregular, sometimes several times a day, sometimes it went well for over a week. It also isn't very stable if cgi apps with soap connections are used with similar problems (again using MySQL for whatever it's worth). Any similarities?

        Did you go into Device Manager, then to the LAN card(s) -&gt;
        Properties -&gt; Power Management and uncheck &quot;Allow the
        computer to turn off this device to save power&quot;? I just
        found that this was enabled on my machine (XP SP2, a
        desktop machine), so I presume this is the setting by
        default, as long as the NIC drivers support it.

      This is only on SP2 but default on all XP SP1 and up.
      I am on SP1 and that thing is one of the first I kill with any fresh install (^^)

      Also things like auto update, remote assistance and system restore will
      get a well placed kick in the complexity before I go on line and update the avir and anti spybot  (^^)


        And maybe it is still worth removing Norton Antivirus for a
        while, just for the test. If the server is not a file
        server, then the lack of antivirus software for some time
        won't do it much harm.

        Boyan

      Not needed. But Norton has never done any harm to my setup.
      Apparently after turning off log files for activity logging and the power save totally, it works fine.
