<PRE>On that note, has there been any new development with Xitami over the years?  Will they continue to develop it at all or will it simply become obsolete?  I run the standard version 2.4d9 on Win2K and am going to probably upgrade to the professional version at some point but I have been on this version for several years now.  The latest version isn't to far past the version I am running which tells me that 2.5c2 was completed years ago and there haven't been any newer versions since.

  I have started to learn Apache and have put it on my new win2003 server for higher end sites. I'll be keeping xitami for some small sites but may eventually move everything over. Xitami has been good for me for the most part. It's great for development but I wanted something capable of doing mod rewrites and ASP with less crashes. I still have about 10 sites on my xitami server, move 3 off to the Apache server.

  Definitely agree with you there

  I just spoke to a friend who is running an Apache server with 100,000 files on his site.
  He has a log file buildup of about 100 Mb every 24 hours, which is huge.
  I am really thankful Xitami doesn't do that to me, since I normally get 100 Mb in a week on 100,000 files.

  Although, if its not able to rotate that little amount, what will happen when I start getting a higher number of hits on say 25 sites?

    Now that could be a reason, but I have never had a problem with Norton before.
    In fact I have used this very same setup for years and never experienced as many crashes as recently.

    I am leaning more towards the large numbe of hits to different virtual hosts causing some overload and 
    xitami not being able to a) rotate the logs fast enough or b) not being able to route the traffic fast enough.
