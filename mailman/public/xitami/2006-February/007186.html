<PRE>Actually I had more issues with the 2.4 version than the 2.5 so I expect
that what ever was the problem was not addressed in the updated version. And
like Mike, this IS an urgent matter. I too only 12 sites and this tends to
happen at the most inopportune time when I can't get back to the server for
hours or days. But I've just gone almost a week with no problems.

&gt;<i>First things first, stop calling every issue you have with Xitami 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;urgent&quot;. Every topic you have started cries wolf that way. Its not 
</I>&gt;<i>only annoying, its a good way to get ignored.
</I>
I have called two posted messages urgent, and both are referring to these
crashes that suddenly became ever more frequent.
Having a site up (or 16 of them) and the server suddenly goes off line as
soon you don't watch it, seems urgent to me, and more so to my clients.

However the many replies in this thread makes the topic stand out perhaps.
I'll give you that.
If many replies and forwards of a certain thread is reason to ignore it,
then that would be up to you.

As I said before, and as Peter also knows, I will likely send for a friend
from Denmark after this semester is over and get to work on the source of
Xitami.
As such, I'll be around in a whole different way, and hardly anything would
seem urgent after that.

I also removed the Urgent word from the reply to this message, as it might
please you a bit better too.
I will also of course follow your advise and pull a copy of the 2.4 version
to see if it will make a difference in this. It would be stupid not to.

Thank you for your advise.

- Mike
