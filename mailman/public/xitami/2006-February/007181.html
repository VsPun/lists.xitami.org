<PRE>
Thank you for explaining the 4 and 5...

I've used Xitami since I first started doing basic HTML code on my 
own just to have something to test it with,
instead of the old angelfire web sites as where massively popular back in 1995.

I think I am coming to a couple of conclusions in this Xitami bug 
issue, and they may be wrong,
until I get more into the source of the applications themselves, but 
here goes nothing.

1) The FTP server should clearly not be used.
     I have tried several other server versions, but what I like with 
Xitami is the simple and straight
     forward VHosting setup and that has lead me to keep running it 
until just a few weeks back.

    In fact I have always truly disliked Apache because of the setup 
and configuration that is so different than Xitami.

  I have tried RaidenFTP and I really like how stabile it is, how 
relatively easy it is to set up on a single
  machine but it's a nightmare trying to write a cgi myself to add or 
remove users. Xitami is unbeatable on ease of use there.
Also, there has to be some way they can keep a nag screen in the 
program without requiring the user who is
testing it to click on their web site ever 1 - 3 hours to keep the 
server alive. It's not only ridiculous but plain stupidly annoying so 
I dumped it.

Now I am testing Platypus FTP server that also support FTPS however 
it is very sluggish, takes for ever to refresh the remote side window 
in the client application.
Doesn't strike me as stabile at all.

So, in regards to Xitami, I disabled the FTP to begin with. This 
removed approx. 75% of all crashes, and in particular the one popping 
up showing C++ errors.
The C++ error leads me to believe there is something in Xitami that 
was not quite written right for an XP machine. After all, the later 
editions of XP, including later installs of SP1 versions does have 
things now included that did not exist back when Xitami's latest 
version was undergoing the highest attention I bet.


2) The CGI environment. Yes, you're absolutely right that it looks 
like parsing pages through an interpretor takes longer time and puts 
a certain load on your server.

Even more so if you add PHP that require a special parser and MIME 
entry to run. PERL is a bit more stabile here, however, I write 
mostly VB based compiled stuff, and the way I write it, it's intended 
to run server side and just return a minimal amount of data to the 
browser where needed.

Since I can't figure out how I first managed to get VBS to run on 
Xitami, I am stuck relearning a lot of my old JavaScript, and trying 
to reduce the load on the server, by pushing most of the front end 
stuff to the client this way. It's actually fairly simple to do, once 
you get an idea as how it runs behind the scene.

More about this below. but first...

3) The LOG files! Apparently a big culprit in causing errors.

There has to be some majestic buildup of data in this processing 
because of the following.

A) As soon I reach close to or over 8000 hits in the properties 
window field Hits: I risk having a crash.
B) If the sum of all hits add up in the kb transfered field, to over 
1,000,000, I know it's coming sooner or later.
C) If you run several VHost sites, I noticed, simply by opening the 
logs folder, to see that all sites hits are not stored in individual 
log files as one would assume.

Lets assume I have SiteA.log, SiteB.log, SiteC.log

I set the log files to cycle daily, without regard for any max size 
of the log files, and instead I end up with log files like this...

SiteA.log + 10 Kb
SiteB.log = 5,006 Kb
SiteC.log = 490 kb


I know, that this is wrong because SiteA.log should be huge and has 
25 times more hits than
SiteC, that currently stands for more than 95% of my mail servers 
traffic for instance.

In addition, I get Ac20022006log.001, Ac20022006log.002, 
Ac20022006log.003, Ac20022006log.004
all containing hits from all of the above.

How can that be &quot;individual logging&quot; for each vhost?  (makes a note 
to self for this years project with studying Xitami source to stop 
this concatenation of log files.)

I just completed a minor CGI that will write my own logs instead, 
saving each site for instance for my main domain as 
www.mrjdesign.net25022006.log for todays hits.
If I add another vhost, it will log in it's own domain+date and if 
the Cycle24hr is true, then it auto generates a new file every 24 
hours, otherwise every hour.

I turned off, the access log, kept the error log and xitami.log 
active, and voila, another 80% of all crash prone activities died.

In all honesty, I did turn of powersave, &quot;turn off monitor after&quot;, 
and the &quot;turn off harddisks after&quot; settings as well.
Why you might ask, but someone suggested there was a backend issue 
with them, and perhaps this leads back
to my original theory above that something in C++ is conflicting with 
how the powersave is handled.

=== In conclusion

Since I did these changes and tests, I have had ONE server crash, and 
it was not on the main server but the developer station,
when I executed a cgi, repeatedly, in fact 1,338 times in the time 
span of less than 30 seconds.

I doubt in this case it was caused by the CGI, but once again a log 
file problem.
The CGI was executed through a javascript that kept calling the page, 
and it could not find one of the components the page referred to.
As such the error log kept building up instead, and thats when it crashed.

=== Now for something much more fun I noticed.

If you execute a CGI, try calling it by passing a action tag through 
JavaScript rather than calling it by other methods.
Why? you might ask.

It's quite simple, if you look at how the processes are executed.

Xitami is pretty strict on the time-out settings fro cgi's, and in my 
case I have it at 60 seconds by default.
Consider the one site I mentioned before, executing a check of 47,000 
images in a mdb file, towards a
VB cgi, running on xitami, its is sometimes dead slow when I have 
many visitors.

On the other hand, I have not yet had a time out error on that CGI, 
and it controls everything from logging
hits per thumbnail, hits per thumbnail page, visitors locations, and 
much more. (including looping and building thumbs pages)

Now, I tried something new, and found to my surprise it actually 
works pretty good.

(lets hope the mail server doesnt think this is a html include here now)

&lt;script src=&quot;<A HREF="http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourCgi.exe&quot;">http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourCgi.exe&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

placed anywhere in your html page will execute the cgi as if you had 
clicked the submit button in a form.

So will the following...

&lt;script src=&quot;<A HREF="http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourController.js&quot;">http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourController.js&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

containing the script line ...

document.write(&quot;&lt;script 
src=\&quot;<A HREF="http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourCgi.exe?PARAM1=&quot;+">http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourCgi.exe?PARAM1=&quot;+</A> What 
YouGotElsewhere +&quot;&amp;PARAM2=&quot;+ SomeOtherDynamicBit +&quot;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;);


This means, you can execute a huge collection of data through java 
script, build a connect string to your cgi and execute the cgi before 
it does the following...

The cgi in this case cannot push any data back to the calling page 
directly... so now we include a statement in the cgi saying

(this is VB guys)

'get out of the cgi  bin into the webpages directory of xitami...
sFILE = App.path &quot;\..\webpages\temp.js&quot;
FN = FreeFile
open sFILE for Output As #FN
Print #FN, &quot;&lt;!-- //&quot;
Print #FN, &quot;document.write(&quot;&quot;Hello World, here is my temp value &quot; &amp; 
varDataFromCGI &amp; &quot;&quot;&quot;);&quot;
Print #FN, &quot;//  --&gt;&quot;
Close #FN



Since Xitami, and any decent server, slows down while the CGI is 
running, this gives you a whole
60 seconds to run what you are doing, produce this temp file and then 
return the processing to
the calling HTML document again.


Now, once the document is release... we are back in the body of the 
HTML page and there you have the following code...
AFTER the CGI and JS mix...


&lt;script src=&quot;<A HREF="http://yoursite.com/tmp.js&quot;">http://yoursite.com/tmp.js&quot;</A>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

and voila, there is your output, without pushing anything from the 
CGI to the HTML directly.

And from what I can tell, you can do this over and over and over, 
like a energizer bunny with a lot less stress on the server itself.
It's partly because now you pushed some of the details down to the 
user, and the CGI processing is only holding a thread for
the server but not communicating back as much as it otherwise would 
with stdio routines.

Well... I hope this is useful to you all. Otherwise I just spent 30 
minutes potential sleeping time typing for nothing &gt;.&lt;
