Subject: [Xitami] Memory leak problems..
Message-ID: <3FCCAED0.8040502@2cah.com>

Just last night I was notified that Xitami Pro was dying a nasty death 
on me..

Windows 2000 Server, latest service packs, running Xitami Pro 2.4d9. 
Other software of note, Microsoft's DNS server, PHP, MySQL and a POL 
(Ultima Online) server.

The message in my event logs was something along the lines of "Memory 
leak, check memtrace.lst"

I can email the memtrace.lst if necessary, I looked at it and it didn't 
tell me much of anything.

The only clue I have is that I had some "person" submitting multiple 
requests for the same file in rapid succession. Some 2000+ requests in a 
little less than 12 hours. The file does exist and is ~2MB in size. At a 
few points in time there were 30 open connections to the same IP for 
this file. Xitami would die during those periods.

I'm not really sure what information is needed, let me know and I'll do 
my best to provide it.

Message-ID: <VPOP32.0.0h.20031204010953.912.224.1.b4eea9b9@mail.ozin.com>

Updated two of my servers (Win 2000) a few days ago to Xitami 2.5c0 from
2.4.d9

I didn't find any real problems (apart from the fact that the exe's had
changed names - including the one that runs the service).

But this evening I've realised that the way it handles php pages has changed
completely. The server headers must have changed as all my dynamic PHP pages
are being cached on all platforms!!!  

Just done a header check and 2.5c0 is passing the modified date of the
actual raw php file in the Last-modified: header as if it were an html file.
This can't be right, can it?!!! 

Presumably 2.4.d9 didn't do this?

Adding a line:

Last-modified:

to .\headers\header.php doesnt help

Help please!!! All my sites are now sick.

further to the report below I've done some tests and here is a new full 
report:

updated two of my servers (Win 2000) a few days ago to Xitami 2.5c0 from 
2.4.d9

I didn't find any real problems (apart from the fact that the exe's had 
changed names - including the one that runs the service).

But yesterday I realised that the way it handles PHP pages has changed 
completely. The server now sends the wrong headers as all my dynamic PHP 
pages are being cached on all platforms and all clients!!!

So I did a header check and 2.5c0 is passing the modified date of the
actual raw php file in the Last-modified: header as if it were an html
file.

This can't be right, can it?!!!
Presumably 2.4.d9 didn't do this?

Adding a line:

Last-modified: etc...

to .\headers\header.php doesn't help in any way

and adding:

header ("Last-Modified: Mon, 30 May 2003 00:00:00 GMT");

to the start of a php file as a test makes no difference either. It's 
still the modified date of the actual raw php file thats passed in the 
header.

Help!!!!

That's sad. I would have thought such a serious bug would have been 
dealt with immediately.

If effectively makes Xitami useless for serving dynamic pages.

Any comments from the Xitami guys?

Why not back step and use 2.4d10??
Using it for intranet applications with no problem at all, database access
with php and display of data no problem.

Indeed. However look at www.xitami.com 2.5c0 is advertised as the current
release, recommended, maintained, secure and stable. But we see that the
people who make these claims haven't responded to a very serious bug that
has been reported more than once. The claims made for 2.5c0 need to be
downgraded (or the version withdrawn) until they have fixed this bug.
Otherwise others will be tempted to upgrade prior 2.4 versions to this
broken version as I did and waste hours of their valuable time.

Do you suppose you could learn how properly to use a mailer?  There
really is absolutely NO need to Base64 encode your words of wisdom.

I run a busy art site.  I'm currently running Xitami 2.4.d9 with no 
problems (save for "The server is busy" error from time to time).  I 
switched to Xitami 2.5.c0 to see if performance was better.  Less 
server errors but some users got incomplete pages downloading 
from the site.  It seemed to be isolated to a certain version of IE but 
I could not confirm that.  Xitami reported a socket error with each 
broken page.  I switched to 2.4.10 and same error.  2.4.d9 is the 
only version I can use that doesn't "bump" some of my user base.

I posted two questions earlier but got no reply.  Anyone else having 
this problem with the new version?

Ironically the problem was actually a feature, added specifically to 
allow filtered pages to be cached.  It does, of course, not make 
sense to cache dynamic output, and this 'feature' has now been 
surgically removed.

There are a couple of other changes in 2.5c1, which will be out later 
today, the most useful being a redirection feature that lets you send 
any alias to some other URL.

We'll post a message here when the new release is available.

I have Xitami installed on a XP Pro machine for a LAN, works fine 
as a service.

I'm not sure which file is the correct file to download and install on
XP.  On the Xitami website it lists XP as an option, but the file

I installed Xitami some time ago when there were different 
installation files for Win98 and XP.  I haven't tried the latest 
installation but according to the iMatix site it's okay for all 
versions of Windows.

If you like, I can zip up the old installation files, which I 
still have, and send them to you, the XP Win installation file is 
only 741K so should download pretty quickly.

If I was starting now, I'd try the latest release first, though.

The Xitami build process changed.  It is still a single script 
(build.sh), but you run it at the main Xitami level, not in the 
xiopen project.

There is however a small problem in the last package, the build.sh 
script appears to be badly generated.  What it should say is simply 
this:

cd sfl
sh boomake build install
cd ..
cd gsl
sh boomake build install
cd ..
cd smt
sh boomake build install
cd ..
cd studio
sh boomake build install
cd ..
cd xiadmin
sh boomake build install
cd ..
cd xiopen
sh boomake build install
cd ..

Surprisingly this syntax error works on our Debian development and 
build servers.  It's been fixed now, thanks for the report.

I am trying to use a CGI to copy content on one directory to another on my
Web server to update information on a ramdisk.  I have set the environment
variable SSI_INSECURE to YES, but it's still not working.  I've tryed 2
ways:

- Through a compiled CGI program.  If I run the CGI from the DOS command
prompt, it runs fine.  But when I try to run it from the Browser using
http://mywebadresse/cgi-bin/doCopy2RamDsk.exe (or even without the .exe) it
displays the text that I've programed into the CGI, but it does not execute
my copy command nor does it display an error of some kind.

- Using #exec cmd="c:\windows\system32\xcopy d:\webpages r:\ /e" (remember
that SSI_INSECURE is set to YES) inside a HTTP page.  I get '[xitami SSI
: ]' which is an error I beleive.  I've tryed to replace the 'xcopy' command
with a "dir" or "set" to see if I would get an output of some kind.  But I
still get the same message: '[xitami SSI : ]'

I use Xitami version 2.5b5 and Windows XP Pro.  Is this a security issue
with WinXP that does not allow me to run system commands from within a CGI?
If so, how can I get aroung it.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!

- Through a compiled CGI program.

I have a whole ordering system running as executable (more than 100 
executables), never had this sort of problem. I'm using w2k and am not sure 
if it's related with XP.
Do you succeed executing other sorts of executables? Maybe you are getting 
a time-out from Xitami?

One error that comes to my mind (and occur quite frequently), is that if 
you use DOS commands from within your executable, you must run them as 
argument of the CMD statement. That is because Xitami starts your 
executable directly, and there is no command interpreter available.

Please include the source code of your program (if it's some kind of widely 
used language) so we can debug it.

I can compile you a small executable that will do the job and/or display 
status information as HTTP output (why the copy was not done). Specify 
exactly what the executable must do. Mail me personally marc@verfaillie.be 
if interested. i'll also include the correct Xitami settings to use.

There are many potential problems, the trick is to solve them one by 
one.

Start with the simplest CGI you can make (like testcgi) and make sure 
that works.

Now add functionality, step by step, testing each time.

It is probably something simple: from your description, I guess the 
executable CGI assumes something (like current directory) that is not 
correct when running under Xitami.  Try running the CGI by hand from 
the Xitami directory, and check the Xitami configuration with respect 
to the CGI working directory.

Maybe you would be interested in the WTP (web transaction protocol) 
that is included in Xitami 2.5?

WTP is a simple but very efficient transaction processing monitor 
that lets you write large database applications to run under Xitami.  
More sophisticated than LRWP, much more efficient than CGI, only for  
C applications at present.

http://www.sms-at.com/wtp/smsat is an example application (you will 
need a Belgian GSM number to register and use it, unfortunately).

You will find WTP, related tools (such as fdlgen/fmlgen) and sample 
applications in the Studio directory of the Xitami source packages.

I have had to downgrade once more to 2.4d10 as 2.5c1 was bringing my servers
to their knees. Every 48 hours or so the server was reporting i/o errors on
many services using TCP/IP ports and Xitami was refusing to run CGI programs
and php refusing to shell to external exes. Stopping Xitami and restarting
solved the problem each time.

Hello all,

I have a question about de [Alias] section in defaults.cfg
If I point to a folder on the local harddisc everything is ok.

Is there a way to point to a folder on an other server?

UNC-path doesn't seem to work (\\server\sharedfoldername or
//server/sharedfoldername)
Drive mapping doesn't work either.
Drive mapping did work on my former server (NT4) with xitami 2.4d9.
On my current server (W2K) runs xitami 2.5d1 as a service

Thanks in advance for your reaction!
Kind regards,

Piet van Dijk

That is because Xitami runs as LOCAL SYSTEM and has no access to external 
shares.
Create a new account with limited rights (but with access to the shares) 
and run Xitami as this account.

You're right. (I should have known this..)
It works fine now!
Thank you very much Marc.

Thanks for all the input guys!

Marc asked for the source code of my program.  It's in RapidQ Basic:
        $APPTYPE CGI
        $INCLUDE "Rapidq.inc"

        Print "Copying Files to RamDisk !<br>"
        Print "Please Wait.<br>"
        shell "c:\windows\system32\xcopy.exe d:\xitami\toramdsk\*.* r:\ /e
/y /h /d"
        print "FINISHED<br>"

I don't think I can be more specific than what is there.  All drive letters
are specified and all.  Whatever I do, I get the following result and the
copy command does not execute:

        Copying Files to RamDisk !
        Please Wait.
        FINISHED

Running the CGI by hand in the cgi-bin directory from command line works
fine. The copied files are listed between "Please Wait" and "FINISHED" as
expected.

If it can do that, you can go further.

tmp$ = ENVIRON$("TEMP")      to locate the temp directory.
                              You can also hard-code it.
cmd$ = ENVIRON$("COMSPEC")   to locate the command interpreter directory
SHELL cmd$ + " /c c:\windows\system32\xcopy .... >>" + tmp$ + "\xxx.tmp"

Xitami evokes executables in the console subsystem (an empty space), while 
running a program from the command prompt actually runs the program as an 
argument of the command interpreter (that is, the command interpreter is 
always available in command prompt mode)

You have to specify where the output goes.
Simply printing it to screen won't work - Xitami does not display a console 
screen, it can even cause your application to fail, waiting for a screen to 
print to that never is available.

fileout$ = ENVIRON$("CGI_STDOUT") that's the file Xitami is expecting
DIM file AS QFileStream
File.Open(fileout$, fmOpenWrite)
File.Write("<html><body>Copying files to Ramdisk<pre>")

Now add the content of tmp$ + "\xxx.tmp" to the output stream (don't know 
how to do that in this dialect)
Seems you can only have one stream open at any given moment.


and terminate:
File.Write("</pre>FINISHED</body></html>")
File.Close

Basically, Xitami is just a fileserver. Whenever a user request a page, 
Xitami delivers it using the correct protocols. When the requested page is 
a CGI,
    Xitami sets some environment variables,
    calls the application,
    waits for it to terminate,
    send the generated output (a file) to the user.

RapidQ is an interpreted language, meaning it's not well suited for cgi 
applications.
Each time your application is started, it must be compiled before execution.
Not very important for desktop applications (these applications are only 
started once a day and the user can wait some seconds), but of great 
importance if you have a web site that relies on cgi.

Subject: [Xitami] http folder must differ from https folder - how?!
Message-ID: <3FD8FD74.4600.1BDC2E32@localhost>

Hi there!

I'd like to [have a friend] use Xitami/Pro to serve up some stuff 
over https.

I find myself going completely bonkers over this one: how to divide 
between the HTTP content and the HTTPS content? Nothing I found stops 
Xitami from happily serving up the sensitive stuff over HTTP _as well 
as_ over HTTPS!  :-/

In other words: I want to serve from two subfolders in /webpages: 
/http & /https, Xitami chosing between the two, based on the protocol 
use by the client.

Must be some incongruity between Xitami's and my philosophy (I find 
it completely trivial in apache.) Surely this is some simple option I 
overlooked in the online docs?

regards & cheers anyway - for a great httpserver

Message-ID: <Law10-OE24uwXNtgEel0000a70f@hotmail.com>

For those following this topic, here's more.
Thank you to those who have given me advices, but we're not there yet.

1) #exec cmd=
On my system (Windows XP), Xitami  (ver 2.5b5) is installed as a Service.
In XP, when you do that, the service runs as LocalService and uses
permissions attributed to Local Services which are limited.  When you set an
Environment Variable (like ssi_insecure) in the Administrator account for
example, it won't be set in the LocalService account, so Xitami won't see
it.

So... I was trying to run a "#exec cmd=" SSIs, but in LocalService, the
SSI_INSECURE was not set to YES: it did not exist.  I changed the rights of
the Xitami Service so it now runs with the Administrator rights.  Now I can
read SSI_INSECURE=YES in the environment variables through a CGI called by
Xitami.  Even there, I have not been able to run anything through #exec cmd=
even something as simple as :

<!--#exec cmd="cmd /c set"-->
or <!--#exec cmd="c:\test.exe"-->  (a simple HelloWorld application that
runs fine as a CGI)...
It should work, shouldn't it???

2) CGI stand alone.
I want to use XCOPY to copy the content of one directory on a hard disk to a
ramdisk through a CGI that run simply by typing
http://myServerAddress/cgi-bin/copy2ramdsk" in a browser (or by clicking on
an Hyperlink).

Someone wrote that I had to use the DOS "CMD" command 'cause it needs the
command line interpreter. But this is not a command line.  It's an .EXE
located in \windows\system32.  The "DIR" command won't work without "CMD",
but xcopy should (I tryed the cmd command anyways - with our without quotes,
but it didn't work).  All the other stuff works:
cmd /c dir c:\
cmd /c copy c:\test\*.* r:\
cmd /c copy \?
cmd c:\xitami\cgi-bin\testcgi.exe

Maybe it's just XCOPY that does not allow this. :-(

About RapidQ basic, I know that it's not the best, but I don't use it for
heavy CGI jobs : it's my "fast testing" software and it's much faster than
my regular C compiler.  It has a CGI switch that compiles (in bytecode) in o
ne pass and the output of the "compiled" application is sent to the stdio
like a regular C application (not the screen).  And it's free !  I use C++
for the real-life stuff.

Xitami/Pro does not allow this separation per protocol, but it does 
let you do much the same thing using virtual hosts.  Since HTTPS is 
bound to an IP address, not a server name, use the default 
configuration for your secure information.  Then add a virtual host 
for your insecure data.

When people come in on the secure connection they will use the 
default configuration.  When people use the insecure connection they 
will use the virtual host configuration.

There is one flaw in this plan: if someone enters the IP address they 
will be sent to the secure data.  This may or may not be a problem 
for you, since HTTPS is not protecting your data so much as allowing 
your users be certain it is coming from you.

There may be other ways to do this, and there are certainly ways to 
make more complex access controls using scripts (which can check and 
switch the HTTP protocol between secure and insecure).

I looked up the DNS entries for both sorcep.com and www.sorcep.com and they
returned an A-record IP of 216.204.150.251

When I go to this address, it is DomainCow. So I assume you are doing so
sort of IP-forwarding? It sure seems like the problem lies there.

  Hello Tom,

  Thank you for replying!  I saw that too.  This has happened more than 
once!  I use a free DNS  service "Domaincow" (only because I don't know how 
to do it any other way), and 216.204.150.251 is in fact one of the DNS 
servers there at Domaincow..  I have the option of logging in and changing 
that back to my IP address.  Is this what I need to do?  I have read several 
times 'here on this list' about some of you running your own DNS, or DNS 
servers etc;  Is this a better way?  IS it something that I should be doing, 
and what does it consist of if you think I should!  Thanks again Tom!  I 
will wait for you to tel me, and I will then go change the web site address 
back to my own, if I should!  Have a good day!

I have been using dns2go.com for over a year now and have not had a bit of

Do you have a static or dynamic IP address?

In general, it's not worth setting up your own DNS server unless you really
care. I use www.zoneedit.com for a lot of my backup DNS servers. Free for up
to 5 domain names.

You will need a minimum of 1 "A-record" pointing your web server IP address.
If you use that domain name for email you need a "MX record" (Mail eXchange)
pointing to the IP of your mail server.

Remember, DNS records take a while to propage thru the internet. Expect
24-96 hours on average before your update is seen by all servers.

Tom

You need two things to make this work.

You need a CNAME record in your DNS server pointing to mydomain.com
Example:
A-record : mydomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1
CNAME-record : www =3D mydomain.com   (This would get resolved as =
www.mydomain.com =3D mydomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1. NOTE: some DNS =
services requite CNAME www.mydomain.com =3D mydomain.com. Check their =
instructions first.)
CNAME-record : sub =3D mydomain.com  (This would get resolved as =
sub.mydomain.com =3D mydomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1)

Now, you need to set up a virtual host in Xitami, where sub.mydomain.com =
=3D config.file

When a request for sub.mydomain.com comes in, it will get passed to the =
virtual host you setup.

A function I've seen but never tried to disable is "Allow Web based Admin".

[Alias]I don't use the gui interface I just change the record in
defaults.cfg, I'll give it a go in there and see what happens. As far as DNS
goes, I get to change that too.

Thanks

  Subject: Re: [Xitami] Sub domains


  Easiest way is to simply set up a new host in Admin.  For example:
      >Virtual Hosts
      >New
      Create virtual host profile:  Anyname
      Enter DNS host name:  sub.yourdomain.com
      Web page root directory:  c:\websites\sub

  That's it.  Don't select an IP address, just take the default of 'all
addresses'.

  You will need to have your DNS provider create an 'A' record for the
sub.domain.com and point it to your server's IP address.  If you do a DIG or
NSLOOKUP, you would see this entry:

      sub.yourdomain.com.      86400    A    123.123.123.123

  Or, if your registrar (such as directNIC.com) will do DNS for you and
wildcard all subdomains (*.yourdomain.com), then nothing further is needed.

Using high priority.
This insures that the scripts that the server executes are running at a 
priority "above average".
There is a very small difference, but only noticeable when running 
complicated executables.

Thanks!  That worked.  A lot of my users use PHP which often use 
a /admin directory.  /admin is far to common a word to keep 
reserved for the server only  Again thanks!

Such delays can be reduced by proper pre-planning of changes.  When
changes to all or part of a domain are expected, change the TTL [Time To
Live] of existing records to some short period (such as 900 seconds) at
least a WEEK before making the change.  After this reduced period has
propagated world-wide, other servers attempting to collect the
information will know that it is more ephemeral, and will collect it
more often and/or sooner.

Then make the changes; wait 30 or so minutes for them to propagate and to
check that everything is working as desired, and then put the TTL back to
the usual 3--7 days.

Using Activestate perl 5.6.something I have had no problems at all with 
installing GD and (getting it to run with Xitami)...  I'm pretty sure I 
used the version 2 ppm rather than the ver 3 one that newer activestate

Well I uninstalled the GD package that I installed with ppm3 and installed
GD with ppm2.  I get the same result.  The GD package fails at line 139.
This is in the newfromjpeg subroutine on line 3.  This is the code that I am
using to call GD:

   $width = '96';
  $pic_tmp = newFromJpeg GD::Image("$pic_file[$count]");
  ($pic_imgW, $pic_imgH) = $pic_tmp->getBounds();
  $ratio = ($pic_imgW / $width);
  $height  = int($pic_imgH/$ratio);
  $FinalImg = new GD::Image($width,$height);

$FinalImg->copyResized($pic_tmp,0,0,0,0,$width,$height,$pic_imgW,$pic_imgH);

  binmode STDOUT;

  print "Content-type: image/jpeg; name=\"${file}_thumb\.jpg\"\n";
  print "Content-Disposition: inline;
filename=\"thumb_$pic_file[$count]\.jpg\"\n\n";
  print $FinalImg->jpeg;

What I am attempting is to have GD create a thumbnail image of a jpg
picture.  Any ideas will be welcomed.

You don't want to use GD then- IIRC Cg has a 256 colour palette so 
photos get trashed. What I did in this case was use qx() to run 
Irfanview (www.irfanview.com) on the relevant file. You use a line like

$rc = qx(i_view32 \\$path\\$img /resample=(${percent}p,${percent}p) 
/convert=\\$path\\small\\$img);

If you are discarding the results then its pretty trivial to delete the 
file once you have sent it....

If you don't mind me offering an alternative suggestion, I prefer to use 
ImageMagick for graphic work.  You need to download the 
ImageMagick library (available as an executable for Win32), then install 
either imagemagick or perlmagick from PPM.  The module's name has 
changed, and I can't remember what it is called now, but I do know it is 
one of those.

I found GD to be weak for my purposes, mainly to create graphs on 
demand.  Now, I use ImageMagick and OLE to create the graphs.  

Check out imagemagick.org.  In retrospect, I think the Win32 executable 
also includes the perl module; so, you probably won't even need to 
install it from PPM.

Sincerely,
Brad Smith

Thanks, I am looking at it now.  Rather hard to find examples on how to
create thumbs.  What I am wanting is to give the routine the JPG file and
have it create the thumb and send it to the browser.  All of this in a perl
CGI program.  I do not want it to save the thumb at all just create it and
send it to the browser.  I do not know if this can be done but it is rather
interesting to try.

Hi
Been away from the list for a while. When did 2.4d10 come out and what 
did it fix from 2.4d9? Also there seems to be no install or setup .exe 
in the download so how do you install it?

Thanks

2.4.d10 fixed the below vulnerability. No advice on the setup, as it is a

Subject: Denial of service vulnerability in Xitami Open Source Web Server

Denial of service vulnerability in Xitami Open Source Web Server
================================================================

Date: 22.09.2003
=====


Affected Systems
================

The vulnerability was discovered on several versions (production and
beta) of Xitami
webserver for Windows NT:

- Xitami 2.5B4 (bw3225b4.exe)
- Xitami 2.5B4 (bs3225b4.exe)
- Xitami 2.4D9 (bw3224d9.exe)

I did no tests with the other versions and os/platforms (OS/2, Alpha,
OpenVMS, Unix).
Therefore I can't confirm that the vulnerability exists there.

The Problem
===========

Xitami is a multiplatform open source web server and the flagship of
iMatix.
The services crashes when it receives a http get request (to a .shtm
file) with
a header field of >= 5154 bytes, followed by a ":".

Xitami dies due to a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error, an
abnormal program termination inside XIWIN32.EXE has occurred.
The message is *not* followed by any Win32 exception dialog.

Vendor:
=======

iMatix was informed about the vulnerability on 04.09.2003 and 05.09.2003
via email.
Up to now, i did not receive an answer from iMatix :(

You can visit the vendors webpage here:

http://www.ximati.com
http://www.imatix.com

Other Notes
===========
Unlike some server crashes, the service process will *not* recover from
the crash
caused by the attack.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will NOT be logged, as the
service crashes.

It seems also not to be clear, what the actual production and beta
release
versions are.
At http://www.xitami.com/download.htm, the current production is 2.4d9
and the current
beta is 2.5b5.
At the same time, at http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm, the
current
production is 2.5b4 and the current beta is 2.5b4?!?

Author:
=======
Oliver Karow (oliver.karow[at]gmx.de)

Exploitation
============

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#
# Simple exploit for Imatix Xitami Webserver on Windows NT
#
# Sending a GET request for a *.shtm file with a header field of >= 5154
bytes, followed by a ":",

Looks like you will need to port-forward port 80 in your router to your
Windows hosting machine.  Also, you will need to permanently assign an
internal IP address to your hosting machine.

Looks like you will need to port-forward port 80 in your router to your
Windows hosting machine.  Also, you will need to permanently assign an
internal IP address to your hosting machine.

  Subject: [Xitami] Running server through a router


  I am trying to run the Xitami web server on my WIndows XP machine that is
connected to the internet via a cable modem (RoadRunner/Motorola Surboard).
The internet connection is split amongst 2 computers using a Linksys router.
When I start the web server everything seems fine, but when I try to access
the web page I have loaded on the server by connecting to my internet
connection's (cable modem) IP address, I am directed to the router's
configuration page.  This also happens when the server is turned off, so
it's not a big suprise.  What is odd is that when I try to connect to the
router's config page by entering the router's default IP address into IE, I
am not taken to the config page as usual, but I'm instead directed to the
web page I have installed on the Xitami web server.  When the web server is
turned off I go straight to the config page as expected.  It seems like
somehow the router's IP is bouncing me back from the router to the computer
with the server installed, and the cable modem's (internet connection) IP is
forwarding straight to the router and never reaching the computer with the
server installed.  I assume this is a relatively simple fix for any of you
that are knowledgeable with networks, but I can't figure out what to do to
fix this & make it work with my set up.  I also cant run the server and a
file sharing program like KazaA or WinMX.  Is there a way to allow for these
programs and the server to all run together harmoniously?  Thanks in advance
for any help, and I apologize if this question has already been beaten to
death.

  Steve
