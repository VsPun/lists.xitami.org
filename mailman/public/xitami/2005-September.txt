Subject: [Xitami] Problem with RDNS in the logfiles
Message-ID: <001801c5b1ac$0bed00a0$b570f353@mine.nu>

Hi

I have a problem with my logfiles. I set ...

[Rdns]
    Debug = "1"
    Primary-server = "85.234.112.181"
    Recurse-lookups = "1"
    Secondary-server = "195.234.128.4"

[Accesslog]
    Custom = ""
    Cycle = "daily"
    Cycle-arg = "ac%yy%mm%dd.log"
    Cycle-day = "0"
    Cycle-how = "rename"
    Cycle-lines = "0"
    Cycle-size = "0"
    Cycle-time = "00:00"
    Enabled = "1"
    Filename = "access.log"
    Format = "XLML"
    Header = "Configuration file was manually tweaked on 2005/04/04. Courtesy of Washuu."
    Local = "1"
    Translate = "1"

and the other 3 log sections likewise.

But the translated line always looks like this :

<LOG DATE="05/Sep/2005:01:48:47 +0100" CLIENT="83.243.112.181.static.cablesurf.de" CLIENTIP="128.30.52.13" SERVERIP="83.243.112.181" REQUEST="GET /login.html HTTP/1.1" METHOD="GET" STATUS="200" RECEIVED="102" SENT="1261" DURATION="" FILENAME="webpages/login.html" USERAGENT="W3C_Validator/1.432" REFERER="" USERNAME="-" SERVICE="HTTP" VHOST="<any>"/>

In the client entry it is not the resoled clientip showing up but the resolved serverip.

Does anybody know how to get the correct info?

Andy

The following applies only if you want the /cgi-bin/ to appear in the
url of the path to your cgi-program: 

You have to name the cgi script exactly as you have set up the name of
your default page.

I.e. if default page is set as index.htm, then the script has to be
named index.htm.  

Xitami/Perl will not mind the file extension as long as 
1) you have the shebang line at beginning of script and 
2) the cgi-bin file-mixing is turned off. I think it's this one: 

[Cgi]
    Mixed-url=0

On the other hand, if your intention is to leave out the /cgi-bin/ from
the script's request path completely, then

1) you either set your root directory as your cgi-bin
2) or you make another alias to the full path of the cgi-program (named
again index.htm if you want it to look like the default page of a
directory).

Hello Members,

as I would like to use the option to compress some bigger websites to speed
up the data transmission I searched the net and found a lot of info
regards Apache  and a gzip add on tool.

Does anyone here have experience with gzip and xitami ?
What steps are needed to install this ?
Some hints and tricks ?

In the info of xitami it shows it is supported, BUT how to get working ??? :)

Would someone be willing to share information and experience ?

HI Folks:

For some reason, when I log on to my FTP server, I am constantly being disconnected and reconnected.  Other programs seem to work properly on that computer.

Could I have inadvertently changed something in the configuration file?

Thanks gang.

I am using XP pro with a D-Link router. The Windows' firewall is disabled because I am using the built-in firewall in the router.  I have enabled port 21 in the router and assigned it to my computer IP address.

Could it be a time out issue? I remember seeing a fix for that a while
back. I know I had an issue where the server would time out when someone
tried to download a photo, especially if they were on dial up and this
fixed it. I think it was that someone had made a change to the
executables.

You could just have index.html (the default page) forward the user to the
script by putting 
	<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/cgi-bin/upload.cgi">
in the header.

Might be a work around if for some reason, the default page can't be a
script. Maybe Xitami checks if the
file actually exists before referring the user to it.

 Not an expert on this, but  I believe the home page has to exist in the
HTDOCS directory or your path has to be an absolute path.

The way I read your default it doesn't tell where the index.cgi
 is located.

yeah, i have contemplated that, however I have multiple sub-directories that 
I need /cgi-bin/upload.cgi to be the default page for that directory which 
means each one of those directories would have an index.html page that 
simply redirects to the /cgi-bin/upload.cgi script.

Theres got to be a way to do it....I would think at least.

So what you are say is that you don't have anything below cgi-bin/ ie
the root? You could make the site = to cgi-bin and just not have a
cgi-bin. 

Or in your site.cfg you can try this if you want to cgi executed at the
root

   Webpages = "webpages/yoursite.com/"
   Cgi-bin = "webpages/yoursite.com"

Or this,
   Webpages = "webpages/yoursite.com/cgi-bin/"
   Cgi-bin = "webpages/yoursite.com/cgi-bin"


And try 

Default2 = "upload.cgi"

I don't know if it will work or not but it's probably worth a try.

I am trying to make my home page, the landing page, a script.  So
instead of 
index.html loading, I want /cgi-bin/index.cgi to load.  And I am trying
to 
set Xitami's configuration to make /cgi-bin/index.cgi the default page
but 
simply adding the following to the Xitami main configuration:

Default Home Page: /cgi-bin/upload.cgi

isn't working.

Hi Folks:

I am trying to access the default dirrectory on my server at:
ftp.compuconference.com

If I access the server from home using either an FTP client such as FileZilla or even Internet Explorer, I am having no problem at all.
However, It doesn't seem to work anywhere else. I am reaching the server but cannot obtain a dirrectory listing.

Any help would be appreciated all over the place.

Works for me.  It must have been forwarding the data port of 20 though your

Hi Brian:

Right now, my server is linked directly to a cable modem.  I bypassed the 
router in an effort to understand just what the problem is.

Thanks.

Are you sure it's ftp.yoursite.com which comes up
ftp://ftp.yoursite.com.

or should it be ftp://yoursite.com for anonymous users. 
Of course you would need to put the username and password there too on
non anonymous users like ftp://username:password@yoursite.com

And I think you need to open port 21 unless you have specified a
different port. I think an SSL connection uses a different port.

Hi Layne:

Thanks much for your response.

I wish I could understand what's happening.

I'm not able to access the server directory at all either in passive or 
non-passive mode.

Again, thanks.

I've been following this discussion and decided to see if I could get
in with FileZilla. I had no problem at all and I would like to thank
you for the copy of "The Complete Idiots Guide to HTML". Not that I
need it as I have the book version. I copied the log of the session
and have attached it hereto.

I hope this helps.

Well Folks:

I guess I am having a problem with my network provider.   When I connect with a wireless connection to another provider, I am able to access the FTP server with no problem.  When, however, I use the standard ADSL connection, it doesn't work.

Thanks for all the help gang.

Some providers blocks the ftp port of 21 and the http port 80 so people
don't run servers.  You could change it to a differnt port say 7021 and it
would probably work. You would have to tell  anybody connecting to use a
port other than the default though.

I put in just the changes, but you can include the whole thing if you want.

Jim,

I tried this from my work pc and got the same problem that you did.  But
it works fine from my home pc.  I use Filezilla on both.  My work pc is
on the company network, firewall, etc, and I don't know how the network
guys have it set up, but maybe there's a clue there.

Message-ID: <EE5D17F9BCAE5645B246C3307D855072380919@mailsrv.dalan.local>

I need to configure virtual subdomains, entirely for local use on my own
laptop eg like this: 

[Virtual-Hosts]
john.mycomputername=/john.cfg
jack.mycomputername=/jack.cfg

or

[Virtual-Hosts]
john.locahost=/john.cfg
jack.localhost=/jack.cfg

I used the wizard and added the subdomains.mycomputername as virtual
hosts, gave them each a home page and used the browser to requeast their
url after resetting Xitami. 

Then I changed everything and repeated for subdomains.locahost.

I could not succeed connecting to any of the above 4 possibilities. XP
brings up a dialog box with connect/work offline buttons. When I click
on the connect button XP brings a dialup or configure network dialog
box.

This does not happen when I add localhost=localhost.cfg as a virtual
host without any subdomains involved. The connect button brings me to
localhost.

XP does understand that the url localhost is the same thing as
mycomputername or 127.0.0.1. But jask.localhost or jack.mycomputername
does not receive the same treatment.

Am I doing something wrong on Xitami or does this have to do with XP
home configuration and is there a solution?

Thanks for any help.

Did you wrote your hostnames in system hosts file (located in 
\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\) to recognise hosts by the operating system?

for example:

127.0.0.1      localhost john.locahost jack.localhost

In all windows versions for localhost on lan base domain names use the 
"hosts" file. The hosts file is the lookup table that each windows pc 
uses befor it querries a dns server. Note that you might want to use the 
ip address of your network card and not the loopback ip of 127.0.0.1 and 
copy the setting to the hosts files of the other pc's on your lan. So 
the can view the pages you are serving. This is all so needed if you are 
running an e-mail server over a lan.

sample of hosts file

127.0.0.1  localhost
127.0.0.1  mycomputername
127.0.0.1  john.mycomputername
127.0.0.1  jack.mycomputername

Hi Jeff - Hi Andris

Thank you for your help. Tried both your suggestions.

C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts already had one line in it:

127.0.0.1	localhost

but both mycomputername and localhost were accessible via browser.

Tried 
all possible combinations/versions, 
changing Xitami config every time, 
restarting both computer/Xitami every time, 
clearing browser-cache every time,
requesting everything from browser every time.

The entire test took about 2 hours.

Browser did not behave per new information in the hosts file but still
could access mycomputername and localhost everytime.

Used IP 127.0.0.1 and left localhost in primary position.

Tried and added :
- subdomain.localhost
- subdomain.mycomputername
- subdomain  all by itself without any dots

In both forms:
- all host names accross IP separated by spaces on same line
- host name accross IP, each on an individual line

All of them seem to be ignored during browser request.

Almost as if XP takes no notice of the hosts file. 

Could there be some other entry on some other XP file that needs to be
carried out? Or could two hosts files be located in different places on
the system?

I appreciate your help.

Ayhan

Hi Ayhan

XP also keeps a hosts file for each user of the system. you need to 
change each user's hosts file as well. This trip me up when we add xp 
systems to our network to.

Are you sure you edit the file "hosts" and not "hosts.sam"?
Must always be a single line for each entry.
Maybe when Windows sees the keywords "localhost" or "mycomputername" it does not look into the hosts file at all. 
You can try to put entries into hosts when you use a name different from your computer's name:
127.0.0.1  anothername
127.0.0.1  sub.anothername
127.0.0.1  more.anothername

Hi Martin,

My file extensions and hidden + system files are all visible.

It is the first time I see the contents of the drivers/etc folder.

I opened and examined each file in amazement and wonder, and saw they
look like Xitami config files.

I tried to enter the new host names also into the networks file, because
it had the IP No.s accross the names. I wanted to see if the computer
would respond. It didn't. So I changed everything back to its original
state. 

The imhosts.sam looked like a complicated format. I decided not to
interfere with it.

I tried many many different names in the hosts file.  Nothing worked. 

I remvoed the localhost entry - localhost was still accessible. I put it
back in.

I tried everything back at work next day on XP Professional. No problem
at all - hosts file absolutely functional. 

There is something wrong with the laptop's XP Home configuration. It
does not respond to changes in the hosts file. There can be two reasons:

a) It is reading the hosts from somewhere else or
b) it is somehow configured to try the dialup first.

The laptop is new and the XP Home was pre-installed together with Norton
Internet Security. I had to turn its firewall off because I could not
get it to peek out and register+live-update itself. It responded to no
kind of "allow" instruction. The XP firewall is enabled in its place
right now.

"I do not have any users on the laptop yet."
I am just beginning to move my things in. Users or passwords wait until
after everything is installed and working.

I don't want to take up much more of the Xitami group's time and
attention with a problem which is evidently Windows-related.

It would be a big help if you could point me to some basic 
XP admin and account management 
reference or discussion group for non-sysadmins. 

I did try the MSDN but I could not find information because I do not
know what exactly I should be looking for.

Anyway - thanks for all trouble.

Ayhan

Hi Ayhan

XP has 2 hosts files.

C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\HOSTS
and
C:\I386\HOSTS

I think that windows reads C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\HOSTS on 
stratup then reads C:\I386\HOSTS for each new conection. I keep both the 
same. Here is a sample.

#------sample--------
#local only
127.0.0.1       localhost 
127.0.0.1       privetpage.test
#Default IP & Host Names for pc and laptops
192.168.1.7     PC1              
192.168.1.9     PC2
192.168.1.3     Laptop1
#Web sits on LAN
192.168.1.3     domain.test
192.168.1.3     john.domain.test
192.168.1.3     jane.domaine.test
192.168.1.9     janes.desk
192.168.1.9     webwork.janes.desk
#Favorites made faster
216.109.118.71  www.yahoo.com

Message-ID: <003901c5c4bf$4867ffa0$85977d81@test123>

I have found some (old) threads regarding Mantis but could not find answers.
 Installation of Mantis goes well, database is created etc. But after
 installation you cannot login. The index.php gets redirected and Xitami
 reacts with a 404:

 127.0.0.1 - - [28/Sep/2005:16:29:22 +0100] "GET /mantis/index.php HTTP/1.1"
 404 0
 127.0.0.1 - - [28/Sep/2005:16:29:44 +0100] "POST /mantis/login.php 
HTTP/1.1"
 404 0

 I install all in webpages (xitami\webpages\mantis) I verified that names 
and
 extensions are rigth, that the file exists. It's probabely something 
trivial
 within xitami.cfg, aut or php.ini. Can anybody give me a hint?

If you're using a proxy server, and/or if aol or your isp uses proxy 
servers, the hosts file in xp is probably  doing nothing.     Seems theres 
also some spyware/adware & blockers that also that can trick you into an 
unknown proxy situation in xp rendering what you see in the etc/HOSTS file 
ineffective.

If you're using IE and proxy server configs might try checking the "bypass 
proxy server for local addresses" under connections.

Hi Magnus - Hi Jeff - Hi Go Bonkers

  If you're using IE and proxy server configs might try checking the
  "bypass proxy server for local addresses" under connections.

When I'm doing all these changes and testing them I am entirely
off-line. There is no LAN connection. The phone jack is pulled out and
we don't have aol. 

Would I still need to try the connections/"bypass proxy server for local
addresses" and where is it located please?

You reminded me of also trying a Netscape request. I'll do that.

I uninstalled Norton Internet Security to do a reinstall for the
firewall allow problem. I tried all virtual subdomain host tests again,
with it uninstalled. Nothing. 

On my computer at work C:\I386\HOSTS does not exist but I'll see on my
laptop. I think no one would have bothered to delete it.

I think I am heading towards an XP reinstall. I hope I can manage it.

Thanks again for all this help.

Ayhan

Hi Magnus - Hi Jeff - Hi Go Bonkers - Hi Andris 

Go Bonkers certainly found the culprit.

Two letters: IE

Can you believe this? I can't, because it should have been the first
thing to check. It's always the first thing I check for any problem I
know about.

Netscape displays any kind of host in the etc/hosts file.
IE opens up the dialup connection dialog box.

And I was about to tear down a Dell laptop operating system!

  If you're using IE and proxy server configs might try checking the
  "bypass proxy server for local addresses" under connections.

Go Bonkers, I do not use an English version of XP. Can you please point
me the way to the above? 

I could not find it in the connection/proxy preferences of IE. I'd like
to access the hosts from both browsers.

I want to thank all of you for writing about the hosts file. This is
such valuable information. 

The hosts file + simplicity of Xitami's virtual hosts configuration
gives you the opportunity to have hundreds of websites on your laptop,
all of them perfectly functional, cgi-bin, aliases, and all, naming them
what ever you like! 

Thanks again.

Ayhan

Sounds like an ISP problem to me, but could also be a broken router. 
Are you sure all PPPoE fields are correct in the router (service name 
and the like)? Tried a different router for a day or so?

have you updated to the latest firmware? The consumer routers are 
strange and buggy beasts, with all sorts of weird and stupid 
behaviour. I have had problems with the 624 before.

On the other hand, sometimes it helps to /downgrade/ to a previous 
firmware... I found a german forum once dedicated to sharing and 
discussing D-Link router firmware versions :-P

I have given up on these units and will only buy slightly more 
expensive routers from now on (I like the Netgear Prosafe series for 
cost/capability).

hey jim:
 my ftp service is fully functional through tcp port 21 only.
 you may want to test drive your own ftp service with the other port(s)
closed... i'm convinced it will still work just fine. please correct me if
i'm wrong :)

If you're using IE and proxy server configs might try checking the
  "bypass proxy server for local addresses" under connections.

Go Bonkers, I do not use an English version of XP. Can you please point
me the way to the above?

  the wireless router mentioned above, is actually a brand new replacement
for an older (linksys befsr41 ver.2 "wired") router which was previously
assumed to be the cause of this issue. the new unit however, did not correct
the problem, and i'm now left holding 2 fully functional routers which both
produce the exact same results. i'm hoping i'll still be able to use the
older unit as a switch at some point, as i've already exceeded my time-frame
allowance for returning the new one. the only really good thing that came
out of the purchase, was an error made by the retailer... and as it turns
out, the new router only cost me about $35 canadian (after rebates). that,
in my opinion, was a very cheap price to pay for a brand-name wireless-g
upgrade.
 my decision to purchase a new router, came after replacing all my cables,
switching rooms, running all the usual security scans, rolling back software
versions, and 2 visits from an isp tech. replacing the router seemed to be
the last logical step at that point.
 the problem first began on the evening of july 26 while a scene from a new
tom selleck movie was being shot on my front lawn. interference from the
film crew's equipment, is what was first assumed by my isp to be the
problem... but it continued right through the entire month of august, long
after the crew had packed up and moved on.
 the problem did however, seem to stop immediately on september 1, right
after disabling the wireless function and updating all nic-card drivers
across the entire lan (a coincidence perhaps)... but decided to return
again, about 4 days ago. just like before, this problem is most likely to
get out of hand in the evenings, weekends, and late at night when the
offices at my isp are closed, and nobody's available to observe what's going
on. my requests for a replacement (isp provided) modem have gone ignored as
well, as they've already given a clean bill of health to the one i currently
have, twice (comtrend 9186).
 pppoe and "keep alive" settings on the router seem to all check out when
the isp's help desk walks me through. they are the same settings i've been
using for the past 4 years.
 i do apologise once again for bringing this into the "xitami" forum, but
from where i sit, i clearly see the relationship between the two... as my
server is unable to perform well as a result.
 thank you kindly for your comments magnus... should anything else on this
topic cross your mind, i'd be very pleased to hear from you. as the old geek
saying goes, "i'm about ready to chuck this thing out the window" :)

Rick, could you recap the problem again.  I deleted the emails concerning 
this and am not able to recover them.  I am a network engineer so I should 
be able to assist in some capacity.  Please describe your LAN setup, your 
gateway equipement and configuration and your connection to your ISP.  Also 
include any pertinent info concerning your wireless configurations, DHCP 
scope definitions, etc.

-R

I had a LinkSys BEFSR41 for about two days before I got fed up.  LinkSys 
_used_ to be good at making hardware - until Cisco bought them out.  Now 
they make junk.  Cisco makes junk too unless you shell out major cash. 
D-Link is what I recommend to people who ask me - the routers D-Link 
makes are quite impressive for the pricetag and I've never had a problem 
setting up their hardware (the software can be somewhat difficult 
depending on the complexity of the setup and whether you are running 
WinXP or not).  My most recent D-Link wireless router purchase was $20 
(US) (after rebate).  They have gone on sale for the past couple years 
the day after Thanksgiving (usually OfficeMax or Best Buy).  Also, 
D-Link has one of the niftiest wireless cards I've ever seen - a USB 
device that is only slightly wider and barely thicker than a USB thumbdrive:

Please excuse me while I totally geek out.
