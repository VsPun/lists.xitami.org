Subject: [Xitami] Xitami CGI bug fix
Message-ID: <42C850B4.7010401@whiteshepherd.net>

With the new Xitami I always had problems with CGI's failing to load.  
Part of the pages would show and the rest blank.  I reported the bug and 
never got a responce.  Someone here on the list recently fixed that 
bug.  I was wondering if this fix was also available for the Windows 
port/version for download?  The buggy versions are still the only ones I 
can download off of xitami.org .

Thanks for any info..  Gene

Hi Layne,

you have to enable passive connections in your ftp client. In addition, you have to force 
xitami to use the interface ,on which the ftp server is listening, to use for the passive 
connections. Take a look at the xitami.cfg for the section.It's easy to find and to 
configure in the default.cfg.

Hello !

If the configuration worked before changing the server, you should be able 
to use the normal ftp (not passive mode). In normal mode, the server 
connects to the client for the data channel (directory listings and file 
transfers). It's a client's problem if the DATA connection could not be 
etablished. Its strange that a server firewall would block outgoing 
connections...


In passive mode, the server tells the client which DATA port it will be 
listening. This range of ports must be opened on the server firewall (the 
ftp server generally rotates through a range of ports to avoid connecting 
to a port that's just being closed).
The default port is 200. You will need to open all ports in the range 200 
to ??? (each PORT command will use another port). There is a PORT for each 
file transfered and each directory listed.

where can i download the latest version of Xitami? the one that runs as a
service on win2003(NT), i couldnt find it on the website anywhere, just the
normal one

im runing version v2.4d6

and ever since win2003 SP1, everything that connects to the internet, has
been having problems, and whenever i disable the Xitami service, for some
very strange reason it fixes itself

could it be coz im running an out-dated version?

-Cheers!

Maybe it is due to that (i.e. your anti-virus program)?  What's the 
status of the Windows Firewall settings?  SP1 introduced most of the 
same features that are in XP SP2 to the 2003 series.

Xitami uses a number of components from other iMatix packages to build.  The 
'c' script being the one you need to compile (others are used when modifying 
the source code).

The simplest solution is to download the Base package from http://
www.imatix.net/pub and extract the 'c' script you'll find in base/boom.  
Place this on the path somewhere.

Alternatively you can build the full Base package, after which Xitami will be 
happy to compile.

I'm sorry for the broken Xitami source package.  I'll get around to fixing it, 
one day.

Maybe it is due to that (i.e. your anti-virus program)?  What's the
status of the Windows Firewall settings?  SP1 introduced most of the
same features that are in XP SP2 to the 2003 series.

You could try turning off AVG while you are downloading.

I had the same problem some time ago. Try to start again without deleting
the downloaded part. That worked for me.

I am finding more and more reasons to have the URL ReWrite feature like
that of Apache. I love Xitami and don't know if I'll ever switch to
Apache, but that ability would be wonderful and if I know how to do it I
would add it. I think that is the one feature I would like to see above
anything else and I think it would seal the deal for a lot of folks.

Hello. I'm using Xitami 2.5c2 on a Windows XP SP2 platform and have the 
following issue: in big HTTP file downloads (tens of MB) over an thernet 
link, if the user clicks and in the "save file" dialog spends too much time 
(more than about 15 seconds or so) looking for where to put his / her file, 
only part of the file is saved and the rest is cut off! I think the longer 
you wait the less it receives...

I've tried to change the "timeout" and "keep-alive" times to huge numbers 
(600) but it doesn't help! Earlier versions of Xitami seem to suffer from 
the same problem as well... Anyone have an idea?

Thank you

I have the impression that this is an IE-specific issue, since I couldn't 
have the same problem under Mozilla (it still works even after 1 minute of 
wait... Interesting)

I've also tried using FTP and it still is the same issue (with IE), after 30 
seconds of wait only the first 64 KB of the file is saved even thought the 
download window thinks that it is the whole 22.4 MB package that's finished 
downloading... Grrr!!

Anyone have an idea o how to solve this?

Message-ID: <69511853.20050722004518@gmail.com>

Hello All,

  I'm running XP Pro SP2 and Xitami/2.5c2. I just downloaded Xitami
  but I was "Forbidden" to get the installer so I took the zip
  version. I followed the instructions and moved xicpl32.cpl to
  C:\windows\system32 but it doesn't want to do _anything_ at all. I
  suspect this is because the installer set some items in the registry
  for it. Is it possible to get a ".reg" file that I can edit so that
  I can have the control panel applet working? The rest of Xitami
  seems to be working fine as it has in the past.

  Thanks in advance for any help.

Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20050722110840.01f76800@verfaillie4.verfaillie.local>

Hello !

I know it's possible to create zipped files for dynamic content by 
providing the correct headers.
For instance a cgi-bin application can provide the necessary headers and 
gzipped content.

But it seems not possible to force NPH for static files (normal content)

This static file is gzipped and contain the correct headers:
http://web.verfaillie.com/test/index1.htm
but displays incorrectly because Xitami is adding it's own headers

Is it possible to tell Xitami that some static files are zipped and already 
have their headers?
Using a specific extension (mapping)?

Thanks,


marc

No one ever replied.  But with large CGI pages (perl, etc).  They do not 
load all the way on larger scripts.  Has this been fixed in the new 
Xitami or does this remain broken?  I remember someone saying the 
figured out how to fix this.  I want the newer Xitami for the bandwidth 
limits but can't use it becouse it's CGI is broken.
