One of my client side applications downloads an xml file from the webserver.
However I was finding that it was failing. So I tried to it manually in a
browser.

example http://www.example.com/example.xml

and got:

Error 501 - The function you requested is not implemented 

After a bit of an investigation I found that I could fix this fault by
commenting out the line:

 .xml=xixxml

in the [Wsx] section of xitami.cfg

Everything seems to be fine now, but I'm concerned I've removed important
functionality from Xitami by doing so. Can anyone advise please?

Now that I have my web server up and running, I'm focusing on making it as
error free as possible.  Since 6am today I've gotten 1078 hits and 95 http
errors.  I've used WebLog expert to analyze the access.log file, and it is
showing all of the errors to be 404 not found errors, but none of my links
are bad, so I don't understand what this could be caused by.  The only thing
I can track down is that the most commonly requested files are cmd.exe and
httpodbc.dll, and I don't know why these particular files are being
accessed.  I am wondering if Xitami is using these files for it's own use,
and that's why they're being requested, if some javascript I'm using needs
them, or if it's an issue of people actually trying to access them.  I can't
imagine the point of downloading that dll file or the command prompt, but
when I try to access those files with the paths listed in the WebLog report,
I get an error about the file not being found on the server.  Any ideas?

Steven, if I'm not mistaken, the httpodbc.dll lookup is something similar to 
Nimda or Code Red trying to spread by looking for vulnerable Microsoft IIS 
servers.  As for the cmd.exe access, it is something similar as well, as it 
appears to be tryin to execute some code on your server that you don't intend 
to allow.  If you go to http://www.google.com and search for "httpodbc.dll 
log entry" or similar, and also "cmd.exe log entry" as a separate search, you 
should find all sorts of info.  All these worms that are loose on the net can 
make your log file a mess sometimes...I know that in the last 6 months, out 
of thousands of 404 errors being logged, I have had less than 20 real 404s 
occur.  The rest were various worms, malware, or script kiddies checking to 
see if my server might be an easy mark.  I'm happy to say that according to 
my manual monitoring, and the results reported by Snort running in IDS mode 
24/7, so far they haven't found Xitami to be easy to crack.  :)

I've taken the approach of making a virtual host.cfg for my IP# and blocking 
access to it.  Those worms still come through but now get logged into a 
separate logfile - keeps my regular logfile much smaller and readable and at 
the same time keeps the kids scanning ip#'s and fiddling around away.

Steve,

Don't forget the default.ida file request that has that gibberishly long
request.  I believe that is an attempt to stuff and overflow some buffer
(that appears fixed in latest Xitami).  Yeah!

Virtual Hosting maintains separate log files for each domain.  (Those
numerical archive things are bugging me though.).  "Access.log" now logs
only the base host.  Since the scanners only go at your WAN IP, it logs into
access.log and the world is a neater, cleaner place.

To be rid of these scans, I first tried to port forward port 80 to another
port on my router but what I wanted to filter just followed the forwarding
(duh!).

So I changed my base HTTP port to 1975.  This eliminates ALL scanners that
come in under my IP (search bots come in by domain).  At my DNS service
(ZoneEdit) I set up a ww2.thisdomain.com(or any extension) for each domain I
have and point it to my server.  In Web Forwarding, each main domain
(www.eachdomain.com and eachdomain.com) to http://ww2eachdomain.com:1975/.
Cloaking is not necessary since you don't really need to hide anything.

This really cleaned up everything.  If you VH, another entry for each ww2
domain must made.

What I want to know is how do we tell these people that their computer is
compromised.  Or retaliate.  The IPs I log appear to be simple users, some
even in my cluster.  Since most Broadband providers frown on serving, it's
not like I can report these incidents to my provider!

Still searching...

Charles

I just noticed this. You are not disabling anything particularly 
important. Xitami has a built in sort of XML processor (see server-side 
XML processing <http://localhost/xitami/index8.htm#using_xml> and 
server-side GSL scripting <http://localhost/xitami/index9.htm#using_gsl> 
) You are not using this anyway so disabling it is just fine

Sometimes xigui32 starts, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't start it
says that port 80 is in use. However I can stop the service, then start
xigui32 then restart the service. Anyone know what's going on here? Do I
have something not configured correctly?

I've also got a mess on ALL my webservers here since upgrading xitami
versions, none of them are installed as a service anymore, bleh.

An installer, or a document perhaps would be nice. using app2service for
now= not an ideal solution.

Hi;

I tried seting up this but it isn't working.
I have www.firstdomain.com and www.seconddomain.cd.
Each of them has a different ip on DNS.
I assigned those 2 IP to the same Nic on the server.
Everithing was working fine with only www.firstdomain.com configured.
Now, since i tryed to add www.seconddomain.cd to the web server i sure =
did
something wrong as now www.firstdomain.com is only accessed from local =
LAN
and i can't acces www.seconddomain.cd.

I didn't tuch the firewall so i guess the problem is with Xitami =
configuration.

Can someone help, please?

Message-ID: <20040206231903.38014.qmail@web41507.mail.yahoo.com>

I am running Xitami on a Win2K pro station.  I have
Xitami starting as a service.  I have PHP 4.3.4
installed and apparently working.  I also have Perl
5.8.2 installed.  
I can not get YaBB to log in.  I think it is something
with the HTTP POST comand, or perhaps system
permissions.  Not sure which, or both.  I have
adjusted the \Xitami \PHP \Perl directories to allow
full permission to all users.  Yet neither YaBB or
UebiMail will get past the first page. YaBB seems to
not be accepting the login name...  Think it is
something with HTTP_POST.  UebiMaiu Won't log in
either. My PHP install test out. So does my Perl.  I
have read many post at the YaBB and UebiMiau and the
common consensus with this problem with both is
permissions.
Does anyone have an Ideas?

Hello,

look at Xitami WBA - Configuration - CGI
Try to find out if the "Use standard I/O" must be checked or not.
The "Pass HTTP fields", "Pass form fields" and "Pass Query_string" must be
checked.

Message-ID: <4025DD34.8010805@relativedata.com>

I wish to update to xitami 2.4d10 from 2.4d9 on my windows machine

The documentation says all i have to do is upgrade the executable.

I have downloaded d10 and noted that it contains several executables 
under a win32 directory. which executable replaces xiwin32.exe that i 
currently am running, and what are the other executables in the package?

Also, what does the control panel (.cpl) app do?

Subject: [Xitami] using cgi with Xitami
Message-ID: <40273CDD.FB88D8C7@infoave.net>

I have xitami 2.4 and it worked great with Win 95 and 98. I use an older
version of Perl and that worked fine with Xitami also.

Now I have new puter and Win XP. The Xitami server will serve web pages
like it did,
but when I call a Perl script with the browser Xitami doesn't return the
Perl output. I get a blank page.

The access log shows this:
127.0.0.1 - - [09/Feb/2004:01:15:53 -0600] "GET /cgi-bin/xtest.cgi
HTTP/1.1" 200 0 "" ""

The error log is empty.

The script writes a file just before exiting, and that worked so I know
the script ran.
However, the output got lost somewhere and a blank page was returned.

Here's the script (xtest.cgi):

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "content-type: text/html\n\n";
print <<end;
<html><body><center>test</center></body></html>
end
open(F, ">xtest.txt");
print F "okedoke";
close F;
exit;


The script created the file, xtest.txt, so I know the script ran.

I expected to get a page back with just the word "test" at the top.
Instead, the page is blank, here is the html code for what is returned:
Here's the page source, which did not come from the script:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html;
charset=windows-1252"></HEAD>
<BODY></BODY></HTML>

As you can see, what is returned is quite different from what the script
output.
So it seems to me that the Perl output got lost and I don't know where
the file
that was returned came from.

Here's what I get back when I run the script in the DOS box:

content-type: text/html

<html><body><center>test</center></body></html>

That's what I should get when I call the script from the browser.

I have tried changing the XP "compatibility" setting to run Xitami in 95
& 98/ME modes but that didn't help.

I don't know what to do to get Xitami to capture the output of Perl and
return it to the browser.

Thanks for any help,
Vera

Hi, im by no means an expert on this, but I had similar problems with a perl
script that worked fine on everything except xp and I believe that the
script has to be told to log in as a user eg your user name and password to
get permission to run.

I couldn't be bothered with this and just back pedalled to 98 but if you are
going to stick with xp then I suspect that you are going to have to modify
all of your scripts in this manner to make them work.

If this is indeed the problem, then it all depends on how you have
Xitami set up. If it's running as an application, then I suspect that
as Garry says you'll have to include a login within the script itself.
However, if Xitami is installed as a system service, there shouldn't
be a problem?

(I'm not sure if you can install Xitami as a service under WinXP Home,
but it definitely works on WinXP Pro)

Thanks to you and Gary.

I donno how to install anything as a "system service"... I'll hunt the help file
but if you got time I'd appreciate a dab of tutoring.

Also I don't know what that "script file" is all about... can't find a installation
info file at the web site.

Hello Vera,

VC> but if you got time I'd appreciate a dab of tutoring.

Right. So I'm assuming that you're manually running Xitami every time
you start your PC, or you've put it in your Startup folder?

A quick way to check what services you have installed is to open a
command prompt window and type 'net start'. This will give you a list
of all services currently running. 'Xitami Web Server' will be near
the bottom of the list, if it's there. If it's not, then...

Installing as a system service - off the top of my head:

1) Make sure you're logged in as administrator. (If you only have one
   user account, then you don't need to worry about this.)
2) Open a command prompt. (Start -> Run -> cmd.exe)
3) Navigate to your Xitami install (Usually C:\Xitami)
4) Type 'xiwinnt -i' (This installs Xitami as a service)
5) Type 'net start xitami' in the command prompt. (This starts the
   service - I can't remember if Xitami starts straight after install,
   but if it does, no problem. It'll just kick up an error saying "The
   requested service has already been started.")

Try running your script now. If it doesn't work, you've wasted five
minutes, and you've eliminated one cause of the error. :)

If it does work, then you'll want to make sure that the Xitami service
starts up by default. To that end:

1) Right click 'My Computer' and click 'Manage' (The Computer
   Management window should appear.)
2) Under 'Services and Applications' in the folder tree on the right,
   select. 'Services'. (A fat list of services should appear in the
   main window.)
3) Scroll down the list until you see 'Xitami Web Server'. Scroll
   across and see what it's 'Startup type' field is set to. If it says
   'Automatic', then you're away. If not, right click -> properties,
   and change it to 'Automatic'. Job done.

Hope this helps. Good luck. :)

Have you tried setting your SSI_INSECURE environment variable?:
"This SSI command - which is a potential security risk for your system - is
only accepted if the environment variable SSI_INSECURE is set to 'yes'.
(Under Windows NT, in the System Control Panel, under 'Environment'"

Wow... thanks a bundle Murali!

Problem... 'net start' doesn't list xitami... and when I try to add it with 'xiwinnt
-i', (step 4)... I get "no such file..."
I don't have a 'xiwinnt' file in my xitami folder. I have xwin32.exe and xixlat.exe and
that's all the .exe's.

Thanks Jeff. No, I haven't set SSI_INSECURE.  I don't use SSI.
When I do the DOS 'set' command it doesn't show up at all.
I think that defaults to off, doesn't it?

Aha. I take it this is quite an old version of Xitami you're running
then? Been using it for about a year, and it's had a service .exe for
at least that long...

I've not actually done much work with Xitami, how much of a pain would
it be for you to upgrade?

Murali... I downloaded this file, bs3225b4.exe and installed it.
This seems to be version 2.5b4 for Windows NT, 95, 98, Linux, OS/2, and Unix.
(I'm using Win XP)

In the "Computer Management", under Services, I now have "Xitami Web Server", and it says it's running.
However... I still can't get a Perl cgi progy to run, but it will run the "textcgi.exe" that comes with it.
Ping 127.0.0.1 works ok.

OK, so permissions shouldn't be an issue.

I'm assuming that '500' refers to HTTP error code 500, which means
Internal Server Error. I don't know much about Xitami config, so
hopefully one of the more experienced people here can think of
something that might be causing it?

Is the Perl script trying to talk to MySQL at all? A quick Google for
'http error messages 1065' came up with it as a MySQL error return,
associated with 'ER_EMPTY_QUERY'.

Sorry I couldn't be of any more help.

Thanks Murali.
No, not trying to do any SQL... just print a little message for testing.

My old version xitami would run Perl but the browser didn't get the output from it.
Now this new version doesn't run Perl at all. (I do have Perl in the path)

I appreciate your efforts and at least you got me as far as getting the "Service"
thing set.

You do realize you need to output the "Content-Type" header to the web
browser or Xitami will give you an HTTP 500 error...

print("Content-Type: text/html\n\n");
...

Hope this helps!

Thanks Tom. Yes, I'm doing the content-type. But the thing is, Perl doesn't run
at all.
I can run the Perl script from the DOS box and the script writes a file if it
runs.
(It's a real simple dummy script) It doesn't write the file when called from
the browser
so it isn't getting called.

Thanks for the try.

Message-ID: <4029F7B0.B71B98F@infoave.net>

Has anyone installed this setup file, bw3225b4.exe, using Win XP, and
gotten a Perl script to work?
It seems Xitami isn't getting the output from Perl, or not passing it
on. I can tell the Perl script
runs because it creates a file if so, and the file gets created. But the
simple page returned by the script
doesn't end up in the browser. Instead of getting the output from the
cgi program (below) I get
a properly coded html blank page.

>From another test I see that the query string makes it to the Perl
interpreter. It all works except that
Xitami doesn't seem to be getting the output from Perl.

Thanks for any help
vera



The simple Perl script (not a problem, runs in DOS box):

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "content-type: text/html\n\n";
print '<html><body><center>TESTING</center></body></html>';
open(F, ">xtest.txt");
print F "ok";
close F;
exit;

Sorry if this seems silly but did you try:

print STDOUT "content-type: text/html\n\n",

and maybe a:

print STDERR "I am here\n\n";

and are you certain that your

/cgi-bin/test.cgi  call gives a 500 error  but
call of your own script gives a 200 ok ??

just to make sure because above two responses are in conflict with one 
another.

Vera,

First off, can you even pull up a generic webpage with your current 
settings.  In your browswer go to: http://127.0.0.1/testpage.html . Making 
certain "testpage.html" exists in your webpages root folder.  If you can't 
pull an html file then you have bigger issues with your configuration and 
most likely its not a cgi issue at all.

Second, if you can pull html normally verify your default.cfg (config) file 
and make certain your cgi path options are set correctly.

ipaddress=127.0.0.1                 #   * = use any IP address on host
webpages=htdocs                     #   Relative or full path
defaults=defaults.cfg               #   Local config file
base-host=basehost.cfg              #   Base host config (optional)
portbase=0                          #   e.g. 5000 for port 5080
priority=1                          #   1 = normal, 2=low, 3=high
background=0                        #   1 = run as daemon
refresh=60                          #   Seconds between refreshes
cgi-url=/cgi-bin                    #   What defines a CGI URL?
cgi-bin=cgi-bin                     #   Relative or full path, or '*'

In the above example, all cgi files can ONLY be refernced as such:  
www.foo.com/cgi-bin/testcgi.pl.

Also verify the CGI section itself:
[CGI]
    enabled=1                           #   CGI programs enabled?
    workdir=-                           #   Where CGI scripts run
    wildcard=0                          #   Allow /cgi-bin anywhere in URL, 
0=No, 1=Yes
    dirlist=0                           #   Allow directory listings
    passargs=0                          #   Pass arguments on command line?
    debug=0                             #   Keep input and output files
    http-fields=1                       #   Add HTTP_ header fields?
    http-prefix=HTTP_                   #   If so, what prefix?
    form-fields=1                       #   Add form fields to environment?
    form-prefix=FORM_                   #   If so, what prefix?
    form-query=0                        #   Pass form fields as 
QUERY_STRING?
    environment=1                       #   CGI gets server environment?

Goodluck.

I've had upgraded to 2.5b4 and I had the problem that I couldn't start any
cgi scripts, even after I tried out all of the configuration. Before this I
have used 2.4d9, and it worked well. I found out that there must be a bug
inside 2.5b4 so I uninstalled it and since then I'm still using 2.4d9. I'm
running it on Win2000. I didn't want to find out what really causes the bug.

2.5 is not stable in the least
I reported this to the list on 10th December but never got a response. My
posting said:

----

I have had to downgrade once more to 2.4d10 as 2.5c1 was bringing my servers
to their knees. Every 48 hours or so the server was reporting i/o errors on
many services using TCP/IP ports and Xitami was refusing to run CGI programs
and php refusing to shell to external exes. Stopping Xitami and restarting
solved the problem each time.

Thanks for the try, Ayhan. STDOUT is the default and there is no error
indication
when the script is called from the browser or from the DOS box.

Thanks Russ. Yep I can pull a html page... even from the cgi-bin. And the test
cgi program even runs.
It's just that the output from the cgi is not returned to the browser. There is
no kind of error indication.

Here's the test script, which runs ok in the DOS box:

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "content-type: text/html\n\n";
print '<html><body><center>test</center></body></html>';
open(F, ">xtest.txt");
print F "okedoke";
close F;
exit;

Here's the source from the page Xitami returns:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"></HEAD>

<BODY></BODY></HTML>

I don't know where that came from, but it didn't come from the test script.
Here's the output from the test script using the DOS box:

content-type: text/html

I've tried all these: bs3225b4, bw3225b4, bw3224d7.exe, and the zip file,
xiopen_2_4.zip
and can't get any of them to work. Maybe it's something to do with Win XP?

Thanks for the try,

Just a shot in the dark, but it might be worth it...

I usually change the first line of the perl scripts to reflect where
perl.exe is located. In my case:

#!d:/perl/bin/perl

Works for me...

Thanks for the try... but Perl does run... it's just that Xitami isn't getting
the output from it.

Are you using Win XP? I'm beginning to think there is something goofy with XP.

If you're using XP, are all your directories "read only"? Mine are, and they
won't stay
unchecked. I don't know if that's goofing with Xitami or not.

First, I want to think the folks who tried to help me.
Second, as a maybe return favor, here is a URL that might be of
interest.

http://www.indigostar.com/

At the bottom, "IndigoPerl"

"IndigoPerl is a binary build of Perl, Apache and PHP for Windows.
IndigoPerl includes an integrated Apache web server.  It can be used for
developing and running Perl scripts and web applications.  A browser
based GUI Package Manager for installing Perl modules is included.
IndigoPerl is free."

I have installed this on Win XP and it works! I could not get any
version of Xitami to work on Win XP,
though it worked just fine on Win 98.

I only use this for local testing, mainly to test my Perl scripts off
line and it works with XP!

Hi to all, WinXP Pro, last version of Xitami.

When I enter in the Adminsitrator panel, I go in :

Virtual hosts, basehost(or default), FTP(upper right corner)

Then here I TRY like a mad to uncheck the "Enable FTP server? " but every
time I try to click on SAVE and I come back to see if it is really
unchecked, I see it again checked and if I restart the server, that damn ftp
it's still running (and in the options it's still checked).

I cant modify anything in the FTP page coz  it seems I cant (or I've not
figured how) save what I want.

I want ONLY the webserver and not the FTP server...

Thanx to everyone ;)

You need to keep clicking SAVE on each page until you have
backed out to the opening page. Then click restart server.

I prefer to just edit the config files directly.

I've read about that report :

http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2003/Nov/1008265.html

It talks about that a remote user can send an HTTP POST header line that
does not contain a colon character (':') to cause the target web server to
enter an endless loop.

It says that the 2.5 ( that is the latest version ) is vulnerable.... it
that thrue ? there is something i can do ?

It's actually "defaults.cfg" (note: plural "s" required).

Look for or set up this section.

[Ftp]
Enabled="0"

xitami.cfg is best used for reference and should not be edited or used.  The
admin pages set up defaults.cfg for you.

Much luck,
Charles

Well, I can't see that the good folks from Imatix are going to waste
still more of their time reading YAXG, so don't expect any feedback from
the authors.

What is it with all these self-aggrandising characters "creating Yahoo
groups"?  For a start, Yahoo's privacy policies leave a lot to be desired
(and in fact are illegal under EU law, which is why they work differently
over here).

Subject: [Xitami] Multiple WEB pages in Xitami.
Message-ID: <021920042055.5432.1d10@att.net>

Hello,

And, Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!

I am a novice at using Xitami or any WEB Page Server and configuration. Just downloaded Xitami with a short test and all is working great on a Windows 95/98 LAN with 7 PCs connected via an 8 port HUB! The WEB page created in c:\xitami\webpages as default.htm can be read by the Browsers at all the PCs on this LAN.

I have been receiving the Xitami Emails for several years before this download and I feel that the following question is probably answered in those Emails. But, the last several years of these have been deleted to reclaim space on the disk.

I have been looking for an example and trying to structure the c:\xitami\webpages\*.htm directory and files for several URLs with no success.

For example:

   1. As a test, the HOSTS file was created with the following entry for each PCs on this LAN:

               10.10.10.7        www.abc.com

This works great and causes the c:\xitami\webpages\default.htm to be displayed at each PC that keys in the following on that PCs WEB browser:

              http://www.abc.com

I would like to add more entries to the HOSTS file for example:

           10.10.10.7         www.abc.com
           10.10.10.7         www.def.com
               .                 . 
             etc.               etc.

Plus, have their respective WEB pages for www.abc.com and www.def.com when those URLs are entered at the BROWSER.

If this can be accomplished via Xitami an example showing how to MAP web pages for 2 URLs would be a GREAT help and would help to show how more can be configured as required.

And,  THANKS for your time, effort, and advise!!!!

Jerry

Message-ID: <00d901c3f75a$6ebbe1f0$6902a8c0@dev>

As the subject suggests, I'm wondering if anyone has successfully
implemented a server using xitami, php, and mysql, on windows. I've got
several win2003 xitami servers, and have recently tried to get this working
on several of them. They all have the same redirect timeout error (let me
know if you want more detail), regardless of my configuration. The packages
I'm using are PHP-Nuke and LandDownUnder.

Several message boards claim things like "PHPNUKE will not work with xitami,
you must use apache" , a test with apache solves the problem. Is there any
way to make this work under xitami ?

Thanks much
Josh

Editing the *.cfg file I had no more ftp running ;)

I edited the defaults.cfg like that :

#*END

[Cgi]
    Enabled = "0"

[Server]
    Recover = "1"

[Ftp]
    Enabled = "0"

And the Xitami.cfg like that :

..
..
..
[Ftp]
#   Specifies whether the FTP service is enabled or not. If you change
#   this, restart Xitami for the changes to take effect.

    enabled=0
..
..
..

Now it works ;) I have only my web server without FTP.

I think it can be a nice thing but I hate yahoo groups coz they r scanned by

Maybe it's better to continue here and to add some FAQ, like my problem with
the ftp that u can resolve editing the cfg files.

I have about 12 sites on that type of config.

php 4.x

One note, I do not use the ftp portion but instead I am using Serv-u.

I am also running a dns server and a mail server (1cis mail server) on the
same pc and use it daily as my main computer.
AMD 850mh processor 1gb ram. 80gb hd and I am mapped to 2 other computers
that I can also use for xitami.

As the subject suggests, I'm wondering if anyone has successfully
implemented a server using xitami, php, and mysql, on windows. I've got
several win2003 xitami servers, and have recently tried to get this working
on several of them. They all have the same redirect timeout error (let me
know if you want more detail), regardless of my configuration. The packages
I'm using are PHP-Nuke and LandDownUnder.

Several message boards claim things like "PHPNUKE will not work with xitami,

way to make this work under xitami ?

Thanks much

:D

Probably the same reason I am. I admin, run, support, and promote Xitami 
on many machines and many platforms, as it is a great product with 
performance beating IIS and Apache. In some cases though, because of 
unresolved issues like this, alternatives must be used. 

Can't complain when its free though :)

I have been running mysql, PHP, and perl on my Xitami under 
win2k for almost two years.  Sames seem fine and at least one of 
my users ran PHPNUKE for over a year before switching to Xoops.  

Personaly I run Xitami 2.49d  I have tried newer versions but about 
2% of my user base would continualy get disconnected.  So I had 
to drop back.

On my win2k3 server I run Apache2 (not for the weak of heart 
setting up) becouse my users want .htaccess files.  On my win2k 
server I run Xitami 2.49d becouse it is fast running and streight 
forward to set up.

Message-ID: <022020041715.13305.530@att.net>

Hello Francis,

Thanks for the REPLY and your comment!!!!!

        >Check out the virtual hosts section of the Xitami config

The documentation for "Configuration" and "Setting-UP A Virtual Host" plus actually going through the motions of using the Xitami WBA was just the TICKET!!!! The terminology was straight forward and the required items were set.

Used WBA SETUP Virtual Host with NEW and set what I thought were the proper settings to isolate these DNS names to their respective directories for HTM, CGI, etc. files.

On the first try it did not work because I thought I had keyed in the following for the DNS names:

      www.abc.com
      www.def.com


When I took a look at the actual .cfg file with a text editor for these DNS names the following was listed:

     Www.abc.com
     Www.def.com

These were reset to www.abc.com and www.def.com and all worked as expected.

Maybe I did not wait long enough for the server to re-read the new cfg file(????).

Also, using WBA I could not find a selection that would allow resetting of the DNS names.
The text editor was used to actually modify the DNS names.


THANKS for your time, effort, and advise!!!!

It's also work good when someone  connect from "outside world" to the server using my private domain name http://www.myname.net
 
BUT when I'm  trying  ( from inside my LAN ) to use my private DOMAIN name I can't connect
(I have already tried to set the host name in the "HOSTS.SAM" file.

SO, what can I do to access my server from my LAN using the domain?

Don't know about the %2E error, never seen it myself, but check the cfg =

Hello Chestnut,

  No idea what's causing it, but 2E is the ASCII code for '.'...

Have you set one of your <site>.cfg file defaults to index.php?

[Server]
   Default2 = "index.php"
   Default3 = "default.htm"

Also make sure you have Filters set in xitami.cfg something like this

[Filter]

You don't just have to edit HOSTS.SAM; you also need to RENAME the file
(to just plain HOSTS, without any extension) before the TCP/IP stack will
look at it.

Mind you, that's not necessarily the only place the problem lies.

(BTW, please adjust your mailer's settings so that it doesn't post in
both plain ASCII and in HTML: the latter is not wanted on any mailing
list.)

Hello Tom, :)

Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!

In your Reply for "xitami and domain name" you mentioned the following:

   "Depending on your network topology, have you 
    checked that Xitami is bound to all IP's?"

I have tried to find out how to "BIND Xitami to all IPs" using Searches on the Internet and the Xitami Document, but am not having any success.

Could you please give an example or point me to a link/document that describes binding Xitami?


FYI,,,,I am a novice user of Xitami. Just loaded it last week and all seems to be working as expected on a LAN using 8 PCs (W95 and W98SE). Xitami is on a W98SE and I am learning and testing using the HOSTS file at each PC to force Domain Names to the IP address of the PC where Xitami is installed. 

Hosts file example:


             xx.yy.zz.1  www.abc.com
             xx.yy.zz.1  www.def.com
                    etc.

These are not registered Domain Names and are used for testing. However, when Xitami is configured to depend on registerd names via Virtual Hosting, I suspect that I will have the same problem as described by shing@walla.co.il. 

I thought that using a registered Domain Name should have worked within shing's LAN. If the Domain Name is not in the HOSTS file I thought it would be routed to the www database (HOSTS file) at the DNS Server which would then route it to shing's IP where Xitami is installed. That is what I thought(????). I have been away from the net a long time (circa 1975) and there is a lot I have to learn.

BTW,,,,, all my PCs are behind a router with the NAT firewall, so I may also have to expose the Xitami PC to the Internet when Xitami is configured to start using registerd Domain Names(???).

Thanks again for your time, help and advise!!!

Jerry :)

  Hello Tom, :)

  Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!

  In your Reply for "xitami and domain name" you mentioned the =
following:

     "Depending on your network topology, have you=20
      checked that Xitami is bound to all IP's?"

  I have tried to find out how to "BIND Xitami to all IPs" using =
Searches on the Internet and the Xitami Document, but am not having any =
success.

You correctly set it in your previous message. I just used general =
terms.

  Could you please give an example or point me to a link/document that =
describes binding Xitami?


  FYI,,,,I am a novice user of Xitami. Just loaded it last week and all =
seems to be working as expected on a LAN using 8 PCs (W95 and W98SE). =
Xitami is on a W98SE and I am learning and testing using the HOSTS file =
at each PC to force Domain Names to the I
  P address of the PC where Xitami is installed.=20

  Hosts file example:


               xx.yy.zz.1  www.abc.com
               xx.yy.zz.1  www.def.com
                      etc.

  These are not registered Domain Names and are used for testing. =
However, when Xitami is configured to depend on registerd names via =
Virtual Hosting, I suspect that I will have the same problem as =
described by shing@walla.co.il.=20

  I thought that using a registered Domain Name should have worked =
within shing's LAN. If the Domain Name is not in the HOSTS file I =
thought it would be routed to the www database (HOSTS file) at the DNS =
Server which would then route it to shing's IP wher
  e Xitami is installed. That is what I thought(????). I have been away =
from the net a long time (circa 1975) and there is a lot I have to =
learn.
It should and does work as you described.=20

  BTW,,,,, all my PCs are behind a router with the NAT firewall, so I =

  Thanks again for your time, help and advise!!!

  Jerry :)
You can have Xitami behind the firewall. You have to configure the =
router to pass all traffic for port 80 to the PC running Xitami.

Here's how the request process should work:
Someone far away requests www.yourdomain.com. The appropriate DNS =
servers hand back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1 (These addresses =
are made up for this discussion). A request to port 80 of 192.168.0.1 =
for www.yourdomain.com is made, and Xitami returns the webpage.
If you are running more than one domain name on Xitami, Xitami Virtual =
hosts will recognise which domain is being asked for, and supplies it.

So now let's say you want to access the website from inside your =
network. You type is www.yourdomain.com. an appropriate outside DNS =
server hands back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1. Your PC says "Hey! =
That's only one PC away from me!" And connect directly to it.

As you can see, it's exactly the same mechanism for being inside the =
network or outside the network.

So what we are dealing with here is some other problem. If all the above =
works from the outside, but not the inside, it is almost certainly a =
firewall problem.
If you are having problems with both the outside and the inside, it =
could be either DNS not configured properly, firewall not configured =
properly, or Xitami not configured properly.

Hope this helps,
Tom

Is this something I should set  up in Xitami?

Almost certainly you need to set a new MIME type in Xitami. Either 
through the WBA or the default.cfg file

I assume it should be:

[Mime]
    Rss = "text/xml"

Ahhh that would be my problem I had it set to rss=text/html, change it to

Hello Tom,,,, :) :)


OK,,,,GREAT INFORMATION and a lot has gone on since CIRCA 1975,,,,,ARPANET to INTERNET and all those PROTOCOLS, plus how they all work on those Op Sys!!!!

OK,,,I have not yet registered any Domain Names, but I will soon. Once registered these will be deleted from the HOSTS file.

The Router is a Lynksys 8 port Router and works grewat on this LAN with the standard NAT firewall. Using the Lynksys logger and so far all unsolicited Incoming records have been ignored. Going on almost a year now!

As I understand, that is if I understand them correctly (the ISP and Lynksys), the PC with Xitami will require a static IP, plus be set to be exposed to the Internet. By this I think I mean it is not removed from the Router (Lynksys 8 port), but set in the Routers setting for the DMZ as exposed to the Internet.

Not ready to configure yet,,,,,,I will when I get the Domain Name(s) registered with InterNic via some registrar.

If you have any further advise on my understanding that would be great!!! :)


THANKS for your time, help, and advise!!!! 

Jerry

  Hello Tom, :)

  Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!

  In your Reply for "xitami and domain name" you mentioned the =
following:

     "Depending on your network topology, have you=20
      checked that Xitami is bound to all IP's?"

  I have tried to find out how to "BIND Xitami to all IPs" using =
Searches on the Internet and the Xitami Document, but am not having any =
success.

You correctly set it in your previous message. I just used general =
terms.

  Could you please give an example or point me to a link/document that =
describes binding Xitami?


  FYI,,,,I am a novice user of Xitami. Just loaded it last week and all =
seems to be working as expected on a LAN using 8 PCs (W95 and W98SE). =
Xitami is on a W98SE and I am learning and testing using the HOSTS file =
at each PC to force Domain Names to the I
  P address of the PC where Xitami is installed.=20

  Hosts file example:


               xx.yy.zz.1  www.abc.com
               xx.yy.zz.1  www.def.com
                      etc.

  These are not registered Domain Names and are used for testing. =
However, when Xitami is configured to depend on registerd names via =
Virtual Hosting, I suspect that I will have the same problem as =
described by shing@walla.co.il.=20

  I thought that using a registered Domain Name should have worked =
within shing's LAN. If the Domain Name is not in the HOSTS file I =
thought it would be routed to the www database (HOSTS file) at the DNS =
Server which would then route it to shing's IP wher
  e Xitami is installed. That is what I thought(????). I have been away =
from the net a long time (circa 1975) and there is a lot I have to =
learn.
It should and does work as you described.=20

  BTW,,,,, all my PCs are behind a router with the NAT firewall, so I =
may also have to expose the Xitami PC to the Internet when Xitami is =
configured to start using registerd Domain Names(???).

  Thanks again for your time, help and advise!!!

  Jerry :)
You can have Xitami behind the firewall. You have to configure the =
router to pass all traffic for port 80 to the PC running Xitami.

Here's how the request process should work:
Someone far away requests www.yourdomain.com. The appropriate DNS =
servers hand back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1 (These addresses =
are made up for this discussion). A request to port 80 of 192.168.0.1 =
for www.yourdomain.com is made, and Xitami returns the webpage.
If you are running more than one domain name on Xitami, Xitami Virtual =
hosts will recognise which domain is being asked for, and supplies it.

So now let's say you want to access the website from inside your =
network. You type is www.yourdomain.com. an appropriate outside DNS =
server hands back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1. Your PC says "Hey! =
That's only one PC away from me!" And connect directly to it.

As you can see, it's exactly the same mechanism for being inside the =
network or outside the network.

So what we are dealing with here is some other problem. If all the above =
works from the outside, but not the inside, it is almost certainly a =
firewall problem.
If you are having problems with both the outside and the inside, it =
could be either DNS not configured properly, firewall not configured =
properly, or Xitami not configured properly.

Hope this helps,
Tom

Hello Tom,,,, :)


OK,,,I have read the Router documetation again and I think I see the light!!!
As you said:

      "You have to configure the router to pass all traffic for port 80 to the PC running 
       Xitami."


Once I tell the Router to pass all traffic to port 80 plus the current IP of the Xitami PC then two things look promising:

    1. All the unsolicited messages being recorded to the Lynksys LogViewer 
       Incoming log file will now go to port 80 for the Xitami PC IP(???).

    2. This means I probably do not need a static IP for that PC as it already 
       has a staic IP as it exists behind the Router(???)

       Also, the Xitami PC will not have to be exposed via the Routers DMZ to 
       the Internet (????)


If this is the case what does Xitami do with a record that is not meant for Xitami (i.e.) not set up in the Xitami Virtual Hosts cfg files? 

      o Does it simply throw it on the "FLOOR" so to speak???? 
      o Can these be recorded to a Xitami log file???

Then the IP to use to register the Domain Name will probably be the IP of the Router. And, if this is the case then it appears I must work with my ISP to provide a static IP for the Router which as I understand is not a static IP.


THANKS for your time, help, and advise!!!! :)

Jerry

There's another bit of light that you could also usefully see: how to
make an effective mailing.

I don't know what
| X-Mailer: AT&T Message Center Version 1 (Feb 13 2004)
is, but it's generating invalid format messages, in that you are sending
MIME multipart/alternative _content_, but not correctly indicating this
in the headers.

Perhaps if you tell it to STOP sending mail in HTML format, which is
never welcome in a mailing list such as this, then things might get
better; this would also have the welcome side-effect of making your
messages considerably shorter.  Another way to do this would be to EXCISE
irrelevant and outdated material from that which you DO quote.

Talking of quoting, you are doing NOTHING to discriminate between that
which you quote and that which you add; this makes your posts even harder
to follow than necessary.


Here <http://www.plig.net/nnq/nquote.html> and also at
<http://homepage.ntlworld.com/g.mccaughan/g/remarks/uquote.html> are a
couple of articles that describe why "top-posting" is a bad idea in news
articles; it applies equally well to mailing lists.  (Indeed, it could be
argued that it applies even more, in relation to not posting HTML,
because the latter is actually partially-tripping the "spam detectors" on
your mail, as evidenced if you look at the headers.)

There is a useful document describing how to prevent this in various
mailers <http://www.camblab.com/nugget/htmlmail.pdf>, although it doesn't
seem to mention yours.

  Hello Tom,,,, :)


  OK,,,I have read the Router documetation again and I think I see the =
light!!!
  As you said:

        "You have to configure the router to pass all traffic for port =
80 to the PC running=20
         Xitami."


  Once I tell the Router to pass all traffic to port 80 plus the current =
IP of the Xitami PC then two things look promising:

      1. All the unsolicited messages being recorded to the Lynksys =
LogViewer=20
         Incoming log file will now go to port 80 for the Xitami PC =
IP(???).

      2. This means I probably do not need a static IP for that PC as it =
already=20
         has a staic IP as it exists behind the Router(???)

         Also, the Xitami PC will not have to be exposed via the Routers =
DMZ to=20
         the Internet (????)

That's excatly right!
Please keep in mind that the Xitami machine IS exposed to the internet, =
but only Port 80. So if a hacker managed to hijack Xitami, he would have =
control over the machine via the Port 80 hole in the firewall.
But this is unlikely with Xitami, so I wouldn't lose to much sleep over =
it. :-)



  If this is the case what does Xitami do with a record that is not =
meant for Xitami (i.e.) not set up in the Xitami Virtual Hosts cfg =
files?=20

        o Does it simply throw it on the "FLOOR" so to speak????=20
        o Can these be recorded to a Xitami log file???

It will reject the request, and record it in a logfile if you so desire. =
I get several hundred requests a day which are trying to exploit various =
unpatched security holes in Microsoft IIS, and lesser amounts trying to =
exploit other webservers. Xitami refuses them and logs and error.


  Then the IP to use to register the Domain Name will probably be the IP =
of the Router. And, if this is the case then it appears I must work with =
my ISP to provide a static IP for the Router which as I understand is =
not a static IP.


Yes, that is correct.
But you can use a dynamic IP if you use a Dynamic DNS service. I don't =
know much about this myself, but I'm sure a search on Google for Dynamic =
DNS will turn up a bunch of info.


  THANKS for your time, help, and advise!!!! :)

I'm glad to help. Good luck!

    Hello Tom, :)

    Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!

    In your Reply for "xitami and domain name" you mentioned the =
following:

       "Depending on your network topology, have you=20
        checked that Xitami is bound to all IP's?"

    I have tried to find out how to "BIND Xitami to all IPs" using =
Searches on the Internet and the Xitami Document, but am not having any =
success.

  You correctly set it in your previous message. I just used general =
terms.

    Could you please give an example or point me to a link/document that =
describes binding Xitami?


    FYI,,,,I am a novice user of Xitami. Just loaded it last week and =
all seems to be working as expected on a LAN using 8 PCs (W95 and =
W98SE). Xitami is on a W98SE and I am learning and testing using the =
HOSTS file at each PC to force Domain Names to the I
    P address of the PC where Xitami is installed.=20

    Hosts file example:


                 xx.yy.zz.1  www.abc.com
                 xx.yy.zz.1  www.def.com
                        etc.

    These are not registered Domain Names and are used for testing. =
However, when Xitami is configured to depend on registerd names via =
Virtual Hosting, I suspect that I will have the same problem as =
described by shing@walla.co.il.=20

    I thought that using a registered Domain Name should have worked =
within shing's LAN. If the Domain Name is not in the HOSTS file I =
thought it would be routed to the www database (HOSTS file) at the DNS =
Server which would then route it to shing's IP wher
    e Xitami is installed. That is what I thought(????). I have been =
away from the net a long time (circa 1975) and there is a lot I have to =
learn.
  It should and does work as you described.=20

    BTW,,,,, all my PCs are behind a router with the NAT firewall, so I =
may also have to expose the Xitami PC to the Internet when Xitami is =
configured to start using registerd Domain Names(???).

    Thanks again for your time, help and advise!!!

    Jerry :)
  You can have Xitami behind the firewall. You have to configure the =
router to pass all traffic for port 80 to the PC running Xitami.

  Here's how the request process should work:
  Someone far away requests www.yourdomain.com. The appropriate DNS =
servers hand back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1 (These addresses =
are made up for this discussion). A request to port 80 of 192.168.0.1 =
for www.yourdomain.com is made, and Xitami returns the webpage.
  If you are running more than one domain name on Xitami, Xitami Virtual =
hosts will recognise which domain is being asked for, and supplies it.

  So now let's say you want to access the website from inside your =
network. You type is www.yourdomain.com. an appropriate outside DNS =
server hands back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1. Your PC says "Hey! =
That's only one PC away from me!" And connect directly to it.

  As you can see, it's exactly the same mechanism for being inside the =
network or outside the network.

  So what we are dealing with here is some other problem. If all the =
above works from the outside, but not the inside, it is almost certainly =
a firewall problem.
  If you are having problems with both the outside and the inside, it =
could be either DNS not configured properly, firewall not configured =
properly, or Xitami not configured properly.

  Hope this helps,
  Tom

Subject: [Xitami] logs
Message-ID: <000f01c3fbd0$fc4deac0$1e02a8c0@midnight>

Greetings...

I have been using Xitami v2.5b4 for a good while now.  I have always had the
log format set to CLSF (NCSA) which is the one I need for my log reader.
About 2 weeks ago, it just stopped logging in CLSF and is now logging the
short version, NCSA common.  I am now loosing a lot of data that I like to
get.  I haven't changed the log type or anything else for that matter.

Does anyone know what may have happened and how I can fix this problem?

Hello Tom, :)

OK, and THANKS for your comments- those were a Great help!

It's been a long time but I am begining to understand how the stuff since 1967-1975 has come to pass.


Thanks for your time, help, and advise.

Regards,

Jerry

  Subject: Re: [Xitami] xitami and domain name


  Hello Tom,,,, :)


  OK,,,I have read the Router documetation again and I think I see the =
light!!!
  As you said:

        "You have to configure the router to pass all traffic for port =
80 to the PC running=20
         Xitami."


  Once I tell the Router to pass all traffic to port 80 plus the current =
IP of the Xitami PC then two things look promising:

      1. All the unsolicited messages being recorded to the Lynksys =
LogViewer=20
         Incoming log file will now go to port 80 for the Xitami PC =
IP(???).

      2. This means I probably do not need a static IP for that PC as it =
already=20
         has a staic IP as it exists behind the Router(???)

         Also, the Xitami PC will not have to be exposed via the Routers =
DMZ to=20
         the Internet (????)

That's excatly right!
Please keep in mind that the Xitami machine IS exposed to the internet, =
but only Port 80. So if a hacker managed to hijack Xitami, he would have =
control over the machine via the Port 80 hole in the firewall.
But this is unlikely with Xitami, so I wouldn't lose to much sleep over =
it. :-)



  If this is the case what does Xitami do with a record that is not =
meant for Xitami (i.e.) not set up in the Xitami Virtual Hosts cfg =
files?=20

        o Does it simply throw it on the "FLOOR" so to speak????=20
        o Can these be recorded to a Xitami log file???

It will reject the request, and record it in a logfile if you so desire. =
I get several hundred requests a day which are trying to exploit various =
unpatched security holes in Microsoft IIS, and lesser amounts trying to =
exploit other webservers. Xitami refuses them and logs and error.


  Then the IP to use to register the Domain Name will probably be the IP =
of the Router. And, if this is the case then it appears I must work with =
my ISP to provide a static IP for the Router which as I understand is =
not a static IP.


Yes, that is correct.
But you can use a dynamic IP if you use a Dynamic DNS service. I don't =
know much about this myself, but I'm sure a search on Google for Dynamic =
DNS will turn up a bunch of info.


  THANKS for your time, help, and advise!!!! :)

I'm glad to help. Good luck!

    Hello Tom, :)

    Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!

    In your Reply for "xitami and domain name" you mentioned the =
following:

       "Depending on your network topology, have you=20
        checked that Xitami is bound to all IP's?"

    I have tried to find out how to "BIND Xitami to all IPs" using =
Searches on the Internet and the Xitami Document, but am not having any =
success.

  You correctly set it in your previous message. I just used general =
terms.

    Could you please give an example or point me to a link/document that =
describes binding Xitami?


    FYI,,,,I am a novice user of Xitami. Just loaded it last week and =
all seems to be working as expected on a LAN using 8 PCs (W95 and =
W98SE). Xitami is on a W98SE and I am learning and testing using the =
HOSTS file at each PC to force Domain Names to the I
    P address of the PC where Xitami is installed.=20

    Hosts file example:


                 xx.yy.zz.1  www.abc.com
                 xx.yy.zz.1  www.def.com
                        etc.

    These are not registered Domain Names and are used for testing. =
However, when Xitami is configured to depend on registerd names via =
Virtual Hosting, I suspect that I will have the same problem as =
described by shing@walla.co.il.=20

    I thought that using a registered Domain Name should have worked =
within shing's LAN. If the Domain Name is not in the HOSTS file I =
thought it would be routed to the www database (HOSTS file) at the DNS =
Server which would then route it to shing's IP wher
    e Xitami is installed. That is what I thought(????). I have been =
away from the net a long time (circa 1975) and there is a lot I have to =
learn.
  It should and does work as you described.=20

    BTW,,,,, all my PCs are behind a router with the NAT firewall, so I =
may also have to expose the Xitami PC to the Internet when Xitami is =
configured to start using registerd Domain Names(???).

    Thanks again for your time, help and advise!!!

    Jerry :)
  You can have Xitami behind the firewall. You have to configure the =
router to pass all traffic for port 80 to the PC running Xitami.

  Here's how the request process should work:
  Someone far away requests www.yourdomain.com. The appropriate DNS =
servers hand back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1 (These addresses =
are made up for this discussion). A request to port 80 of 192.168.0.1 =
for www.yourdomain.com is made, and Xitami returns the webpage.
  If you are running more than one domain name on Xitami, Xitami Virtual =
hosts will recognise which domain is being asked for, and supplies it.

  So now let's say you want to access the website from inside your =
network. You type is www.yourdomain.com. an appropriate outside DNS =
server hands back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1. Your PC says "Hey! =
That's only one PC away from me!" And connect directly to it.

  As you can see, it's exactly the same mechanism for being inside the =
network or outside the network.

  So what we are dealing with here is some other problem. If all the =
above works from the outside, but not the inside, it is almost certainly =
a firewall problem.
  If you are having problems with both the outside and the inside, it =
could be either DNS not configured properly, firewall not configured =
properly, or Xitami not configured properly.

  Hope this helps,
  Tom

Hello Tom and Brian,

I have reviewed all the Email since I joined in this Subject and I hope I understand all the Great advise. 

Since this will be forwarded by the Xitami Email Forum, please let me know if the format of this Email is better.

Hopefully, the HTML, plus the setting for a copy of the ORIGINAL are turned off.

Thanks for your time, advise and help!

Plaese have a nice weekend!
