<PRE>Hi Jerry,

I'm not sure exactly what type of security you're referring to.  The term 
&quot;security&quot; usually encompasses several different components.  One of these 
is validation, which Xitami provides in the form of username/password 
prompts.  This is the one of the simplest forms of validation.  Once you 
validate with a username and password, your connection is &quot;trusted&quot; by the 
server, and you can send and receive data (within your privledges).

If you want security &quot;of the actual data being transmitted,&quot; you're 
probably looking for encryption.  I am not aware that Xitami provides 
encryption on the fly like that, although I am not an expert at this.  If 
Xitami were to encrypt data, it would have to be some sort of encryption 
that can be decrypted by a web browser, FTP client, or even a DOS 
session.  I am not aware of any type of &quot;decryption&quot; algorithm or process 
that occurs at, for example, a simple DOS prompt telnet session.

Perhaps I'm just not reading your question correctly.  If you know the 
username and password for an FTP server (any server), I'm not sure what 
other security could be provided &quot;on the fly,&quot; and if it was, I'm not sure 
what kind of additional authentication process you'd have to go through in 
order to read the data.

Can you give an example of a feature on a different FTP server that does 
this?  Thanks!

Michael
