No it doesn't; OS/2 expands wildcards within each application, not within
the shell.  So the parameter &quot;*.c&quot; would be passed over intact to the
c.cmd (is this a batch file, or is it a proper REXX command procedure?)
and this in turn (presumably) will pass it on to gcc --- which doesn't
know how to expand &quot;*.c&quot;.

[If c.cmd *is* written in REXX, rather than just a series of OS/2
commands, then it would be easy to rewrite so as to expand *.c]

I still can't get over the concept that a file might be required, is
mentioned in a particular file, but that file doesn't exist!  I presume
one of the instances of &quot;c.conf&quot; in that line quoted above is actually
something else?

-- 
   fix (vb.): 1. to paper over, obscure, hide from public view; 2. to
   work around, in a way that produces unintended consequences that are
   worse than the original problem.  Usage: &quot;Windows ME fixes many of the
   shortcomings of Windows 98 SE&quot;.
