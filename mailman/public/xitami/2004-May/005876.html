&gt;<i> All we want to do is tell someone how to use FTP (syntax example of an

</I>&gt;<i> this LAN.

Why on earth are you persisting in trying to use Internet Explorer, which
is a BROWSER and hence intended for looking AT information, in the
entirely unsuitable role of a general-purpose FTP client?  IE is ONLY
able to be an FTP client for the purposes of GETting files; it is useless
for the purposes of any other action, such as PUTting a file, or renaming
files on the server.  Come to that, the whole scheme of URIs (or URLs,
for those that fail to keep up with standards) has no provision for
specifying any form of FTP transfer apart from a GET operation (except
for performing a LIST, to get a directory listing; this can be done by
ensuring that the trailing solidus is present after the directory name).

You either need a dedicated FTP client with a GUI, or more competent
[human] clients that can use a CLUI FTP client, such as FTP.EXE that
comes as part of all versions of Windows.

[Whilst you're at it, consider trimming needlessly quoted material; there
were 183 lines of old posts following yours, almost completely
irrelevant.]

   fix (vb.): 1. to paper over, obscure, hide from public view; 2. to
   work around, in a way that produces unintended consequences that are
   worse than the original problem.  Usage: &quot;Windows ME fixes many of the
   shortcomings of Windows 98 SE&quot;.
