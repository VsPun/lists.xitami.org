Hi Jill,

It looks like each site is &quot;working,&quot; as long as you go into the directory
for each site.  What you need to do is tell Xitami, &quot;hey, if someone gets
here by using www.boatsafe.ca, then send them to this folder.  If they get
here using www.twochickies.ca, then send them to this folder,&quot; etc.

That's easy to do.  What you will do is create a text file called
&quot;defaults.cfg&quot; in your Xitami folder, and you will create a .cfg file for
each of your hosts.

When Xitami starts, it loads a configuration file called Xitami.cfg.  You
might want to take a look at it sometime, it is very self-explanitory.
After Xitami loads this file, it looks for a file called defaults.cfg, and
if it exists, it will &quot;override&quot; any setting in xitami.cfg with what's in
defaults.cfg.  This is a good thing, because you probably shouldn't ever
change xitami.cfg.  If you need to make changes to Xitami's configuration,
it's a good idea to put them in defaults.cfg.

So.....In your &quot;defaults.cfg&quot; file, put the following:


[Virtual Hosts]
   www.boatsafe.ca = &quot;boatsafe.cfg&quot;


You're telling Xitami that you host a site called www.boatsafe.ca, and the
instructions for delivering that page can be found in the file called
boatsafe.cfg.  Of course, you can make that filename anything you want,
but it's a good idea to give it a name that makes sense.  :-)

So now, when someone visits your site via www.boatsafe.ca, Xitami will
know that it needs to refer to boatsafe.cfg to get instructions on how to
deliver that page.  That means we need a boatsafe.cfg!

Create a file called &quot;boatsafe.cfg&quot; in your Xitami folder.  In that file,
put the following:

[Server]
   webpages = &quot;./boatsafe&quot;

Here, you're telling Xitami that the files for your boatsafe pages can be
found in a particular location.  I'm assuming that your web page directory
is &quot;under&quot; your Xitami directory.  If not, just put the complete path to
your boatsafe pages there.

That should do it for boatsafe.  If you would like to &quot;point&quot; your other
sites, just add lines to the default.cfg file, and create the appropriate
.cfg files that point to the appropriate directories.  For example, if you
were hosting twochickies too, your defaults.cfg would look something like:

[Virtual Hosts]
   www.boatsafe.ca = &quot;boatsafe.cfg&quot;
   www.twochickies.ca = &quot;twochickies.cfg&quot;

and you would create twochickies.cfg to look like this:

[Server]
   webpages = &quot;./twochickies&quot;

That's all there is to it!  There is a lot of information that you can put
in these .cfg files to make Xitami act different ways when folks visit
different sites for you.  Keep working at it!  Xitami is a GREAT server,
it kicks Apache's butt.  :-)

Oh, one more thing:  In your defaults.cfg file, you REALLY should add:

[Security]
   dirlist = &quot;0&quot;

That way, no one will be able to get the directory list that Xitami is
delivering now, even if you DON'T have default pages.  Never a good idea
to deliver a directory listing of your computer.

Good luck!  If you need any more help, just ask.  :-)
