<PRE>Hi,

I am using Xitami Pro 2.4d10 on NT4.0.
I've had some problems with the log files not being 
renamed (permission denied), so they were no rotated at all; I had 
to play with the logs configurations, basically I've just changed 
them and now it is working fine. I understand that this is not 
*exactly* your problem since rotation works to some extent. 

My take on this was that the configuration files for the Pro version 
were &quot;inherited&quot; from 2.4d7 (whose help files were in the 
distribution package) hence not updated in some sections (e.g. 
there was no log directory entry, maybe other things). Playing with 
the web admin tool might have put the missing entries back in, I 
guess..

Please note that the website that I am running is only for research 
and is not receiving a lot of hits.

</I>&gt;<i>   Xitami seems to have a hard time rotating the access logs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Xitami should be copying the current access.log file to yesterdays
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   date 'ac0x0x0x.log' type of thing, but sometimes it skips days,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   and the access.log file just gets bigger and bigger... then it finally does it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   I am thinking that when my server is busy, and it is suppose to actually rotate
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   the log file, it can't because the server is being hit, and it is writing to the file,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   access denied type of thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   I even gave up having Xitami do it, and wrote a perl script to do the rotating for me, but
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Xitami won't let go of the access.log file, and I can't delete it to start
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   fresh after I copy the file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Any ideas on how to get Xitami to perform this seemingly simple task???
