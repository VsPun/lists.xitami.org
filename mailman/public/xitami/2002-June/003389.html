I'd prefer perl if you're offering :)

Its a native XML aware language. And it has no overhead to deal with non 
XML things. Basically its extremely good at taking a template and 
applying it to well structured data and completely crap at everything 
else. But since about 90% of what I want to use Xitami for is taking 
structured static data and displaying it prettily as HTML its perfect 
for my needs. I use perl to do the more dynamic bits but even if I were 
to use Apahe+mod_perl+LWP+XML parsing I doubt I could get as fast a 
rendering of static data on the same (relatively low end) hardware.

I believe GSL is open source.

The thing is that I think GSL could be used better by me. But since I 
can't fgure out how to do a coupe of things it isn't.
