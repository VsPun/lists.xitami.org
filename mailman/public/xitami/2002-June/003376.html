As a developer of both free and commercial software I do feel a need to add my
comments to Pieter's excellent response to a rather controversial issue.

Open source software is a GOOD thing. However, it does come at a cost. That
cost is laid upon the developers of the package involved. We do the best we
can trying to balance the scales. Economics play a large part in the decisions
that are made. Our investment means money, for those inclined to do so in an
open source world the investment is time. In a commercial world, time IS
money.

I guess in short what I am trying to say is this... Don't be so critical of
Imatix in their release schedule. If you are so inclined to criticize their
efforts, put yourself in their shoes and see what it takes to produce a
product that is as reliable as Xitami is. It is NOT easy.

What it all boils down to is this.. The source code is available, if you don't
like what is currently offered, take the time to learn it, make the changes
and submit them to the Xitami team. They WILL listen. What you will gain is a
bit of fame, what the rest of us will gain is a product that exceeds the
expectations of even the Xitami team.

After all, that is what open source is all about..
