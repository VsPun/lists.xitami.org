<PRE>Thanks Pieter for explaining this.

Basicly I think the webserver is just doing a fine
job. At least the win32 version is very stable, the
GUI-taskbar-thing was not that good because of the
memory-leaks:-(

I run Xitami with PHP on a Windows98 machine and its
simpy doing the job. The PHP-pages could be a bit
faster but that has nothing to do with the web-server;
I could install apc-php-cache if I really need the
speed...

The only thing I think could use some improvement is
the tool to do the settings of the server.

That is, the web-based admin-system is good, but
looking at the messages in this mailinglist, it could
be a bit better especially for how to setup vhosts
etcetera? I guess more and more people are getting
used to GUI's for doing their settings instead of
editting INI files?

The other thing is the rotating of log-files, which
indeed is not always going as expected (that is, it
will skip rotation now and then). I guess the locking
of the log-files when a visitor is on the site indeed
has something to do with it, my server is experiencing
the same problems.

I hope this helps where to focus for the most 'needed'
improvements.

Greetings from the Netherlands and thumbs up!
