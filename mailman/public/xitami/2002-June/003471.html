So what?
a) The passwords will be sent over the wire as base64 encoded which is 
essentially plaintext since it is NOT a 1-way hash. These passwords are 
therefore nothing close to secure anyway which is why no one uses them 
for web authentication in places where security is an issue.
b) The problem is the lack of windows user/file ownership not the 
plaintextness of the passwords. If you have console access to a windows 
machine running any webserver you can do anything you want. The fact 
that you have access to the password file is a trivial side-effect.

Encyphering these passwords would actually give a misleading sense of 
security since it is so easy to see them over the wire.

By the way

If you want to have secure password access the bets way is to use a cgi 
program to set a cookie and a GSL or similar script to read the cookie 
and display the page if it matches that in a XML hash file. This can be 
quite general purpose (i.e. you can do 
<A HREF="http://server/secure.gsl?/path/file.htm">http://server/secure.gsl?/path/file.htm</A> to display arbitrary files but 
with an initial security check to see if this should be permitted)

If anyone wants the code for the above I would be happy to share it 
somewhere once I have tidied it up a bit. It really isn't complicated 
once you decice how to allocate the permissions.
