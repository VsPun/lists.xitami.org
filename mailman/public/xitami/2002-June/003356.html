<PRE>&gt;<i> Your message intrigues me. I run Xitami Pro and host about 6 sites, 4 of
</I>&gt;<i> them my own. I am on a DSL line and the company I have it through will not
</I>&gt;<i> let me have any more. Mabry I am wet behind the ears ( I am when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> computers) but are you having several different domaine names on the same IP
</I>&gt;<i> addresses? If I am wrong. please let me know, and If you are, will you tell
</I>&gt;<i> me how it is done? but in plain language.
</I>
this is called &quot;virtual hosting&quot;.  most webhosting companies that offer a
&quot;lite&quot; option (or big hosts like earthlink or yahoo) do this to save IP
addresses (which aren't really necessary for webhosting, anyway).  the trick
is to have a webserver that will parse the domain name you enter and server
up pages from a corresponding directory.  xitami does support virtual
domains, although i haven't had to use this feature yet.  you configure the
virtual domain in the admin web interface and it'll serve as many virtual
domains as you like on different ports (try to use ports numbers greater than
1024 - i would start with port 8080, but that's just me...)


the catch is that people won't be able use your IP address in their browsers,
because you'll have multiple domains on there (maybe it would default to the
page being served on port 80, but i've seen pages just hang) - 

nslookup foo.com

Name:    foo.com
Address:  207.229.128.68

nslookup bar.com

Name:    bar.com
Address:  207.229.128.68


make sense?
