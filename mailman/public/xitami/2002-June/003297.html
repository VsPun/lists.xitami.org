<PRE>Hi,

I've been running Xitami Pro, 2.4d10 for 4 months. It works well 
except a few minor issues. So I would say it is stable.
The problems are
	- initially there is no logs directory, you'll have to create it 
yourself; Xitami tells you this in the console log or if you run it as 
console mode which I recommend during the site certificate setup
	- setting up the certificates it's a bit tricky, I think there is a 
problem with a path in the configuration file; in the SSL section of 
sslhttp.cfs which contains these entries
    
    [Ssl]
        cert-key=key.pem   
        cert-file=cert.pem 
        ca-cert-path=certs 
        ca-cert-file=thawteca.pem

I've had to specify the path like this, it seemed that ca-cert-path 
entry is not working

 [Ssl]
        cert-key=key.pem   
        cert-file=certs\cert.pem 
        ca-cert-path=certs 
        ca-cert-file=thawteca.pem

	- generating certificates with extended validity, ex. 1 year 
requires that you get the documentation for ssleay, actually there 
is a parameter called -days that needs to be changed
	- it the begining I've had a problem with the log files not being 
renamed (permission denied); I've had to play with the logs 
configurations, basically I've just change them and now it is working
	- the documentation (i.e. the html help files) is outdated (from 
2.4d7)
	- once you get/generate your certificates (1024 bit keys) and 
make the ssl work, the encription is seamless for you, as far as 
CGI or lrwp programming, are concerned; however, the whole 
transfers are slowed down the speed probably depends on your 
machine as well as users' machines
	- all in all, it seems that although Xitami Pro I have is the 
version 2.4d10, its configuration and other files have somewhat not 
been fully updated

Please note that the website that I am running is only for research and is not receiving a lot of hits.
