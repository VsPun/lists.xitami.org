Would someone from Imatix like to explain (again) to bugtraq that read 
access to any configuration file whether or not it contains passwords is 
a huge security hole. But that in windows with no user access control 
you can't hide files.

Note that my (test) installation of Apache also has a clear text config 
file in the conf directory. Any user on a windoes machine can read and 
write any file in that directory also. Since I removed IIS for being a 
security hazard I have no idea whether IIS also has a similar config 
file/directory but I'll bet that if not anyone runing regedit would be 
in luck
