<PRE>Read my message again.  The only way I could get that output was to run 
the program AT A DOS PROMPT and record the results.  IT STILL 
DOES NOT RUN IN XITAMI.  All it does in Xitami is return a blank 
page with ABSOLUTELY NOT HTML FORMATTING AT ALL.  I 
would be happy if I could get the error results to show using Xitami, then I 
would consider it a PHP or Squirrel Mail configuration problem.  So far, 
with any PHP script I have run I get the same results - A BLANK PAGE.  
I can run the test.php and hello.php files AT A DOS PROMPT and record 
the correct results to a text file, so PHP is running fine - except for 
configuring Squirrel Mail.  I have asked repeatedly on PHP lists about this 
problem, they all say it is an Xitami problem and advise me to get another 
web server.
