If you look at the problem report again, they don't have an issue with web 
authentication.

The problem is that the administrators username and password are saved in 
plaintext in the configuration file. Anyone with local access to the 
computer has access to the administrators username and password - and all 
other passwords, since Xitami stores all passwords in plaintext.

No, that is not a trivial side-effect. It is not even a side effect. A 
&quot;choice&quot; was made to leave the password in plaintext!


Imatix,

Why were the passwords in the configuration files (default.aut, 
ftpusers.aut, etc.) left in plaintext? Is there any plan to change that?


Mike
