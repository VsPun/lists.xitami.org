<PRE>Hi,

I have been through this myself.
The first suggestion is to unzip Xitami Pro in another folder, preferably in
the root, like c:\Xipro and keep your previous Xitami config
handy/functional in case things go wrong. run xitami pro from the console,
do not use it as a service yet. Open a DOS box and run xipro -d. If anything
is wrong it will be output in the console. For example, xipro will complain
about missing logs directory. Create it manually.

Yes, first COPY your configs and dir structure, do not remove them yet.
Remove when you get everything working.

The best would be to try it out on a test machine, get it working and make
changes quickly on your server afterwards.
There are a few tricky configs especially for the SSL. I replied with a few
of them when people asked previously about Xitami Pro.

Because it's the pro version it means that you would be able to handle SSL
(i.e. HTTPS requests, port 443), however if one type HTTP instead of HTTPS
the nonsecure versions of the webpages you serve is available. You might
want to restrict HTTPS to only sensitive data forms, because HTTPS
encryption slows things down.

The keys you generate them yourself using ssleay tool. The certificates will
be therefore self issued unless you buy one from verisign or other.. This
self issued thing will make a window pop up in IE which asks the user if
he/she chooses to trust the issuer (i.e. yourself), other than that
everything is fine, as long as you match the certificate issuer with the
actual site address and your certificate is valid. By default, the ssleay
configuraiton file (sslcert.cfg) makes certificates which are valid only 1
month. Use the parameter -days (e.g. -days 365) to extend the validity of
the self issued cert. to a year.

here's  a paste of makecertificateLONG.bat which I derived from  make
certificate.bat
use it to generate your key and certificate.

@echo off
Echo Do you wish to make a new certificate (press Ctrl-C to cancel)?
Pause
ssleay genrsa -rand .rnd -out key.pem 1024
ssleay req -new -key key.pem -out cert.pem -x509 -days 365 -config
sslcert.cfg
del .rnd


There is a problem with an config entry in the sslhttp.cfs configuraiton
file. I will paste the ssl section here and you'll make the difference.

[Ssl]
    cert-key=key.pem                    #   Server key
    cert-file=cert.pem                  #   Server certificate
    ca-cert-path=certs                  #   Certificate authorities path
#    ca-cert-file=ca-cert.pem            #   Certificate authorities file
#   For Thawte test certificates
    ca-cert-file=certs\thawteca.pem           #   Server certificate
    required-ciphers=
    verify-client=0
    verify-depth=10

Actually the difference is that you have to specify path info in
ca-cert-file (e.g. ca-cert-file=certs\thawteca.pem) otherwise the server
won't find the certificate and complain in the console.

Read ssldoc.txt again, it actually contains the bare necessity.


Good luck

Stefan

Subject: [Xitami] HELP! Upgrading to Xitami Pro


Ok, folks need some serious help here, i don't have a lot of time to do
research on this - so I need the crash course.

I am running the normal Xitami and am upgrading to Xitami Pro.  As usual,
there is hardly ANY documentation on how to do this step by step.  Do I
install to same directory OR do I install to a new directory and copy my
previous configs/directory structure over?  Because it is the Pro version
does that mean EVERY site is going to be a secure site - or can I only turn
the secure feature on for specific pages or links within each site?  Are
there tricky configurations I need to be aware of.  I do know I am supposed
to get a KEY from somewhere, but again, I don't understand this process.  I
don't want to disrupt my current installation.

I am in a bind and need to upgrade fast b/c one of my sites needs to do
Credit Card transactions.  So any and all help is very appreciated.  I have
never worked with SSL and I am worried about the time involved to get this
all working.
