Ok, folks need some serious help here, i don't have a lot of time to do =
research on this - so I need the crash course.

I am running the normal Xitami and am upgrading to Xitami Pro.  As =
usual, there is hardly ANY documentation on how to do this step by step. =
 Do I install to same directory OR do I install to a new directory and =
copy my previous configs/directory structure over?  Because it is the =
Pro version does that mean EVERY site is going to be a secure site - or =
can I only turn the secure feature on for specific pages or links within =
each site?  Are there tricky configurations I need to be aware of.  I do =
know I am supposed to get a KEY from somewhere, but again, I don't =
understand this process.  I don't want to disrupt my current =
installation.

I am in a bind and need to upgrade fast b/c one of my sites needs to do =
Credit Card transactions.  So any and all help is very appreciated.  I =
have never worked with SSL and I am worried about the time involved to =
get this all working.
