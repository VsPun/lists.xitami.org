<PRE>Most other servers I have seen (UNIX and WIN) running Virtual Hosting or
names based hosting will default to a particular webpage when the IP

&gt;<i> Your message intrigues me. I run Xitami Pro and host about 6 sites, 4 
</I>&gt;<i> of them my own. I am on a DSL line and the company I have it through 
</I>&gt;<i> will not let me have any more. Mabry I am wet behind the ears ( I am 
</I>&gt;<i> when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> computers) but are you having several different domaine names on the
</I>same IP
&gt;<i> addresses? If I am wrong. please let me know, and If you are, will you
</I>tell
&gt;<i> me how it is done? but in plain language.
</I>
this is called &quot;virtual hosting&quot;.  most webhosting companies that offer
a &quot;lite&quot; option (or big hosts like earthlink or yahoo) do this to save
IP addresses (which aren't really necessary for webhosting, anyway).
the trick is to have a webserver that will parse the domain name you
enter and server up pages from a corresponding directory.  xitami does
support virtual domains, although i haven't had to use this feature yet.
you configure the virtual domain in the admin web interface and it'll
serve as many virtual domains as you like on different ports (try to use
ports numbers greater than 1024 - i would start with port 8080, but
that's just me...)


the catch is that people won't be able use your IP address in their
browsers, because you'll have multiple domains on there (maybe it would
default to the page being served on port 80, but i've seen pages just
hang) - 

nslookup foo.com

Name:    foo.com
Address:  207.229.128.68

nslookup bar.com

Name:    bar.com
Address:  207.229.128.68


make sense?
