<PRE>You should also consider the frequency in which nev versions come available
of those servers. Regretfully development of Xitami has almost come to an
end. This will become more and more a disadvantage compared to the other
open source webservers.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Would like some advice on the advantages vs disadvantages of the various
</I>&gt;<i> open source servers around.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;xitami / apache / python(zope) / ++ &lt;=........ how about the top 10
</I>&gt;<i> ANYONE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Dave,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm replying not as an expert but as a user which is a useful perspective
</I>&gt;<i> too. I have been experimenting with different servers and have certainly
</I>&gt;<i> found them to have some obvious strengths and weaknesses from the end
</I>user's
&gt;<i> perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like Xitami in that it runs efficiently and is very easy to configure.
</I>You
&gt;<i> can also come here for support issues. In all my wanderings I have yet to
</I>&gt;<i> find a server with as straightforward a configuration as this one. It will
</I>&gt;<i> get the most out of your hardware which is a bonus too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apache is an industry standard and has a huge number of contributers. You
</I>&gt;<i> can download prebuilt modules which extend the basic functionality of the
</I>&gt;<i> server as well. You have to do your research to configure this one but
</I>there
&gt;<i> is a lot of info and examples out there. Functionality is excellent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pi3web is a newer server which is gaining in popularity and supports all
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of popular technologies, but again, configuration is not so
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward as Xitami and there is much less documentation than
</I>Apache.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Java based web servers are gaining in both popularity and usefulness. That
</I>&gt;<i> has been surprising to me as java is not the most hardware-efficient
</I>&gt;<i> language, but benchmarks and personal experience have attested that there
</I>&gt;<i> are useful products out there. Generally the java based servers are set up
</I>&gt;<i> to use servlets or java server pages or else serve static content but
</I>there
&gt;<i> is now work underway to support other scripting languages like PHP and
</I>Perl.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jigsaw server is a case study for the World Wide Web Consortium
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw">http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw</A>) and has support for servlets and also for
</I>filters
&gt;<i> like PHP (although I've had trouble connecting to a database through PHP
</I>&gt;<i> with this server). You can also set it up to work with a Java Server Pages
</I>&gt;<i> engine. The standard in java based servers right now though is Tomcat
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat</A>) which was originally largely just a
</I>&gt;<i> servlet engine for apache but has become a stronger stand-alone server in
</I>&gt;<i> version 4 and comes with built in support for java server pages (using the
</I>&gt;<i> Jasper engine). Jetty is another server worth looking at
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://jetty.mortbay.org">http://jetty.mortbay.org</A>) as it is built specifically to run as a
</I>&gt;<i> stand-alone server and has some load-balancing features built into it. Jo
</I>is
&gt;<i> another popular java server (<A HREF="http://www.tagtraum.com">http://www.tagtraum.com</A>) which comes with
</I>good
&gt;<i> documentation. These servers are great for java applications but are not
</I>as
&gt;<i> popular yet for general purposes although they are showing promise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully you'll get some help from those with more experience but I
</I>thought
&gt;<i> I'd put in my two cents in case it can help as a springboard.
