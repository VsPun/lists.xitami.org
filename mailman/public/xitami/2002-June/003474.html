Well, yeah that will happen if your PHP.INI file is configured incorrectly.
 If you look on line 24 of 'C:\PHP\squirrelmail\functions\gettext.php', you
see that 'session_register('gettext_php_loaded');' is the function call on
that line.

Going to www.php.net, you can find out that session_register() starts a new
session and adds a variable/string/whatnot to the session.  Based on this
it should be seen that session_register can't create a new file called
'/tmp\sess_18ba7237a4d01d6fe12ca7773ffa4091' because:

1)  This isn't *NIX (duh).
2)  There is no '/tmp' directory on the local machine.
3)  No filesystem on the face of this planet (AFAIK) fully accepts
mixed-slash notation.
4)  Your PHP.INI file is configured incorrectly for session management.

The solution to this problem is to fix the session management issues:

1)  Create a directory called 'C:\TEMP' on the local machine (name it
whatever you want).
2)  Locate 'session.save_path = /tmp' in the PHP.INI file and change it to
'session.save_path = c:\temp'.

Try SquirrelMail again.  It should work this time (provided that you have
run the config.pl tool and configured it properly).

I have no idea why you put SquirrelMail with PHP as the root directory.
There is no need for that since it will work fine even under a Xitami VHost.

In the future, you should note that this list is for Xitami-specific
issues.  PHP issues should be directed elsewhere.  At this point, PHP is
working fine with Xitami, and so any issues with SquirrelMail/PHP should be
directed at the appropriate locations.

BTW, PHP is working fine on my machine with SquirrelMail via XiFusion v2.6.
 So, there is probably something wrong with your setup if you can't get
XiFusion and PHP to work together.

Hope this helps!
