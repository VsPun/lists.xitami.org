Well I don't know when you joined but there have been posts today. You 
should get this message twice as I'm sending it direct to you and to the 
list

&gt;<i>   Is there any way to hide that page as the root directory?  I would 
</I>&gt;<i> like it if users could NOT access that page showing that whole folders 
</I>&gt;<i> contents, by individual files!  My reason for this is that I often 
</I>&gt;<i> keep dupes, and experimental pages inside the same folder as is 
</I>&gt;<i> public, and I would like for the user to only be able to access files 
</I>&gt;<i> that I create a link to.  I hope I explained this well enough for 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;someone&quot; to answer it!  Thanks in advance for any help with this!  
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, if I am posting wrong, or going about this wrong, please 
</I>&gt;<i> let me know so I can correct it!  Good day all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>easy set dirlist=0 in the [Security] section of defaults.cfg

Alternatively if using the web based admin tool you should uncheck the &quot; 
Allow directory lists?  &quot; checkbox in the security page.
