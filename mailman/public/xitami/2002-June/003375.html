We have been very busy.  Running a business has meant putting 
resources where they make the money that pays the rent, and since 
1999 this has meant slowing down work and support for Xitami.

We have occasionally considered ending the Xitami project, since it 
is expensive, hard work, and tends to burn-out the people who work on 
it.  However, we always come back to the same conclusion: it is a 
great project, important to us, and we will not abandon our users.

So, I can state for the record that as long as iMatix exists, we will 
continue the Xitami open source project.  We continue to work on the 
source code, especially the SMT kernel on which Xitami is based, and 
we are almost finished with a new packaging tool that will allow us 
to make new releases more easily than has been the case for the last 
few years.  We plan a 2.5 final release, and then a new 3.0 alpha 
release.

However, I can't make any statement about when and how such new 
releases will come.  This all depends on how much money and effort we 
can shift into Xitami, and the motivation of the people who work on 
it.
