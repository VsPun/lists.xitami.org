&gt;<i>I've tried asking this question on the PHP lists, but all I've gotten for 
</I>&gt;<i>answers is &quot;fix the CGI&quot; (it's been working fine as far as I can tell) and 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Use something other than Xitami&quot; (duh - if I wanted to use something else, 
</I>&gt;<i>I would)
</I>
Open Source mailing lists are usually not very helpful in my own personal
experience (others may have experienced otherwise).  I'm on this list to
help people...sometimes I do, other times I don't.  Hey, that's life!  :)

&gt;<i>I'm running a fairly customized Win98 machine.  There is plenty of 
</I>&gt;<i>memory, plenty of hard drive.  It's my workstation, so it's sharing a bunch 
</I>&gt;<i>of apps with the system, but Xitami seems to run fine.  I've got CGI 
</I>&gt;<i>working and the one script I run (a very simple mail client called 
</I>&gt;<i>ThinMailer) is working fine except for the fact that my inbox often has 300 
</I>&gt;<i>messages or so - it times out on that one.  So, I've downloaded 
</I>&gt;<i>Squirrelmail and PHP and have attempted to make them work.  No good.  
</I>
I personally know the Ehresmans (founders of SquirrelMail).  So, I have a
small amount of knowledge of how it works.

&gt;<i>Currently, the &quot;test&quot; page grinds and grinds forever, and the status line
</I>says, 
&gt;<i>&quot;Web site found, waiting for reply&quot; (how long does it take to connect to 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;localhost&quot;?) Then  I get, &quot;This server is currently overloaded - please try 
</I>&gt;<i>again later &quot; - what overload? theres's only one program running on the 
</I>&gt;<i>server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, any hints?
</I>
Ahh...I've had this problem before with Xitami.  This is (most likely)
related to the PHP Header(&quot;Location: ...&quot;) function.  The problem is that
the PHP script is causing the browser to redirect to a non-HTTP-standard
page since PHP is _assuming_ the server will do the re-direct (such scripts
are designed for Apache with PHP as a compiled module).  Now, don't get
your hopes up, but I would give XiFusion v2.5 a shot.  You can get it from
the Shining Light Productions website:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.shininglightpro.com/">http://www.shininglightpro.com/</A>&gt;

Follow the 'readme.txt' file and let us know if it works.  If it doesn't,
try again when XiFusion v2.6 comes out (v2.6 does re-direction differently).

Hope this helps!
