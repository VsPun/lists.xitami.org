<PRE>Okay I have somewhat of a solution, still requires a bunch of cfg files (for
now) but at least it's a bit more manageable. what I did was created a
directory just for the subdomain cfg's for a particular site. like this;
 
 
site.cfg
site (directory)
    subdomain.cfg
    subdomain2.cfg
site2.cfg
site2 (directory)
    subdomain.cfg
    subdomain2.cfg
 
I suppose I could even put the cfg for the main site in there too.

Very simple.

You add 101 files, not 2000.

Disable online administration and disallow the web admin interface for your
VHosts, as it would render Xitami wide open to security leaks having web
admin enabled.

As such, you point all AUT files for your VHosts to one single disabled
admin file.

Voila, 99 files out of 100 removed.

As for the other 100 files, I find it extremely useful to have them in
separate files, thereby simplifying the management of documents.

Besides, it is a very simple dead to write a CGI for your self, to run off
of the root on the server,
to effectively write your own admin panel, which only you have access to and
is hidden from 
the publicly known view, by the documentation files of xitami.

As such you can in fact turn off the web admin completely, disable the LRWP
from port 81, unless you use it for some ssl functions.
You should already have disabled the ftp, which is controlled from the
default.cfg anyway, in a INI file style.

All of which is really simple to manage.

That's the way I do it at least.
Pretty simple and 99% of my work is done by remote control anyway.
In fact I have not had a monitor on any one of my servers for the past three
years.
Except once, when installing a new machine 4 months ago.

Thought I'd start a wish list, maybe someone has thought about it and maybe
some have implemented it. The first item on my Xitami Wish List is this.

I would like all my .aut's in one file and all my .cfg's in one file and
xitami just call the section that it needs. I have 12 sites but I have 32
.cfg's and 32 .aut's and I'm getting ready to add over 100 subdomains which
will increase my file count by 200+. Then if I might do that for 2 other
site which will increase it again by 400+. That's a lot of small little
files to keep track of. 

Ideas, suggestions? 

Move to Apache????
