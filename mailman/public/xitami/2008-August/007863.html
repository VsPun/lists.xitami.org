<PRE>Someone in here said it does work out of the box. but surely did not on 
my machine.
I ran the std installer of PHP 5 and use Xitami 2.5 for dev purposes only.

there is a slight error in the solution script you have to change the 
function name in the calling sample, thats all.

It may work for some, for others not.
I know my version of the REQUEST_EX will work both on apache and xitami 
in the same manner.

Good luck.
Mike
&gt;<i> In default setup of PHP 5 on Windows you should be aware of the following.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a)    $_POST[$VarName] WILL NOT WORK
</I>&gt;<i>        $_SESSION[$xVar]  WILL NOT WORK
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
