Intimidated to post?
This is something I understand, and perhaps the reason why I'm still running Xitami 'out of the box' after nearly four years. This however, along with trial &amp; error, are my only sources of Xitami knowledge, so I wait patiently, and hope that someone else comes along asking questions about things I'd like to learn......then hope to hell that someone replies in a straight forward language that I'm able to understand. Some users tend to become very irritated with others who aren't quite up on all the terminology, others seem to become irritated when topics have been discussed more than once, which IMO, sort of defeats the purpose of discussion.....especially if the previously discussed material did not prove to be useful.
 
I'm still REALLY stuck on a few things that have been discussed here more than once in the past, but I'm not about to ask questions......especially after seeing the frustration cause by some the people whom I've witnessed asking already.
 
If you find an answer to your original question Rick, feel free to contact me off-list. It's something I'd really like to know about myself :-D
 
Cheers!
Rod
