No, when switching the 8.3 naming convention OFF, you switch compatibility 
with legacy applications off. The 8.3 sheme has a 8 character limit, the 
LFN not.
By switching 8.3 support off, you switch off the possibility to display 
file names using the 8.3 naming convention for applications needing it.
Not having to bother to create unique 8.3 filenames based on the LFN can 
speed up the system. Whenever a file is created, a 8.3 filename must be 
created too, and in most cases this mean that the directory must be 
searched to look for an unique name, and create a new one if the name is 
already in use. With large directories, this process must be repeated over 
and over.

 From Microsoft:
&quot;Every time you create a file with a long file name, NTFS creates a second 
file entry that has a similar 8.3 short file name. A file with an 8.3 short 
file name has a file name containing 1 to 8 characters and a file name 
extension containing 1 to 3 characters. The file name and file name 
extension are separated by a period.
If you have a large number of files (300,000 or more) in a folder, and the 
files have long file names with the same initial characters, the time 
required to create the files increases. The increase occurs because NTFS 
bases the short file name on the first six characters of the long file 
name. In folders with more than 300,000 files, the short file names start 
to conflict after NTFS uses all of the 8.3 names that are similar to the 
long file names. Repeated conflicts between a generated short file name and 
existing short file names cause NTFS to regenerate the short file name from 
6 to 8 times.
To reduce the time required to create files, you can use the fsutil 
behavior set disable8dot3 command to disable the creation of 8.3 short file 
names. (You must restart your computer for this setting to take effect.) 
For more information about disabling 8.3 short file names, see 
&quot;MS-DOS-Readable File Names on NTFS Volumes&quot; later in this chapter.&quot;
