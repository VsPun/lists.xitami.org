thank you kindly for your input martin! this is certainly an option i will=

consider, if all else fails. my main objective however, is to keep this as=
=20
simple as possible for the end user. we all know how most people (average=
=20
folks) fail to read instructions, and shun things which they so carelessly=
=20
perceive as &quot;geek-talk&quot; or &quot;technical detail&quot;. complete 'click and go'=20
automation is my goal, it keeps average folks content ;)

thank you for your interesting suggestion marc! by this, i assume that you=

are talking about editing the individual headers of each of my files in=20

something i plan to look into more deeply in the near future. if it works,=

it has the potential to fuel my imagination for other projects which are=20
currently on my back-burners :)

</I>&gt;<i> That is just what download sites like tucows.com &lt;<A HREF="http://tucows.com">http://tucows.com</A>&gt; &amp;=20
</I>download.com &lt;<A HREF="http://download.com">http://download.com</A>&gt; do.
&gt;<i> What you need is some java script code for auto download on the page.
</I>&gt;<i> Then clicking on the file in a list brings up a page with the java code.
</I>&gt;<i> Do a search for free java scripts.
</I>
interesting that you mention java-script alex, as it's originally where i=
=20
first assumed i'd find a solution. it seems logical to me, that some very=
=20
simple java-script should be able to deal with such a thing rather=20
efficiently. a search of all my favourite java-script sites however, turns=
=20
up nothing of the sort whatsoever.
 i'm able to google-up numerous support forums though, only to read posts=
=20
from so many others, who are trying to achieve similar results. most of=20
these threads start out discussing the availability of such pre-written=20
java-script... but then after much confusion and failed tests, they=20
eventually focus their attention around php. this particular php script=20
seems most popular for the purpose:
 <A HREF="http://elouai.com/force-download.php=20">http://elouai.com/force-download.php=20</A>
 on a side note to all of this, i often use a rather nifty little service=
=20
for sending extremely large e-mail attachments (up to 1gb. in size):
 <A HREF="http://s5.yousendit.com/">http://s5.yousendit.com/</A>
 - when downloading files through this service, they never attempt to load=
=20
into an associated program, regardless of their type. for an example of=20
exactly what i'm talking about, please click this direct file-link to a=20
windows-media-video file, and watch how it prompts your download dialog,=20
rather than your file-player:
 <A HREF="http://d50.yousendit.com/C/0LJ97YT1TG4M0QY8UE1AT47UL/Use_seat.wmv">http://d50.yousendit.com/C/0LJ97YT1TG4M0QY8UE1AT47UL/Use_seat.wmv</A>
 because &quot;this particular example&quot; completely eliminates the use of=20
web-pages, it also eliminates the possible use of java-script. this is what=
=20
first gave me the idea that something must be tweaked on their web-server..=
.=20
and my main reason for bringing such a question into the xitami forum.
 i'd like to be able to copy whatever it is they're doing.

&gt;<i> &quot;Jeff McDonald&quot; - said:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not use a fpt link insted of a http link to the file.
</I> thank you jeff! i assumed this might work as well... 'my' tests however,=
=20
have concluded that left-clicking a direct ftp-link to a media-file 'still'=
=20
makes a call to the file-player (on all 3 of my work-stations). to run thes=
e=20
tests, i've been accessing media-files (via ftp link) which are located on =
a=20
friend's ms-iis server (if that makes any difference).
 very bad things happen when i attempt to access my own xitami ftp service=
=20
from within the local network. it's always been this way. i've learned to=
=20
live with it ;)

</I>&gt;<i> An ftp link will open the file the same way an http link will.
</I> i agree 100% michael. thank you for your input :)

 ... they most certainly do, at my location.
