<PRE>Thank you -- I like that definition best;-)

I always looked at it this way; this &quot;/&quot; is a forward slash simply because it
is one of these &quot;|&quot; that is falling FORWARD, you know, like we read left to
right. (english) So IMO in left to right, RIGHT is FORWARD. And of course
using this logic a &quot;\&quot; is a backslash because it is a &quot;|&quot; falling backwards.
heh.:-)

hacking, whacking and slashing with forward progress,
-John.

 &gt; I didn't even know what a backslash was until I got my first computer in
 &gt; 198x something or other. We know things change thoughout the years and
 &gt; here is what my friends who work for Microsoft say.

 &gt; &quot;\&quot; is a backslash
 &gt; &quot;/&quot; is a whack

 &gt; So something like this http:// would be http:whackwhack and this c:\ would
 &gt; be c:backslash

 &gt; It most decidedly NOT a &quot;backslash&quot;.  Back in the 1960s, when I too used
 &gt; to use IBJOB control cards and the like, the character was generally just
 &gt; called &quot;slash&quot;.  Purists might call it &quot;oblique&quot; or &quot;solidus&quot;.  NO ONE
 &gt; EVER called it a &quot;backslash&quot; in that era.

&gt;&gt;<i>                            It deals with the motion one makes with a pen
</I> &gt; or
&gt;&gt;<i> pencil as opposed to direction of incline.  For those who remember cards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;backslash,backslash&quot; defined a command card in IBM Job Control Language
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (JCL).
</I>
 &gt; A  novel etymology: would you like to air such ludicrous views in a place
 &gt; densely populated with very erudite &quot;old farts&quot;; I mean, of course, the
 &gt; newsgroup &lt;news:alt.folklore.computers&gt;.

 &gt; Moreover, the punched card code had no means of generating what is
 &gt; correctly called a backslash.  The character is simply a &quot;slash&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;\&quot; - this is the forward slash.  Again, describing a physical motion.
</I>
 &gt; That character was never seen until the second (or was it the third?)
 &gt; revision of ANSI X3.64 (aka ASCII) in the mid-to-late-1960s.  As soon as
 &gt; it appeared, some people started calling it a &quot;backslash&quot;, because it was
 &gt; the mirror image of the familiar &quot;slash&quot; character aforementioned.  Other
 &gt; names are &quot;reverse slash&quot; or &quot;reverse solidus&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> be gentle,
</I>
 &gt; Why?  If you spout arrant nonsense, you must expect to be ridiculed and
 &gt; royally flamed.   There are already far too many &quot;intellectually
 &gt; challenged&quot; Windoze lusers around who don't understand the correct
 &gt; nomenclature, and like you, have it arse-backwards.  Don't add to their
 &gt; paucity of knowledge by reinforcing a contradiction.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't the term &quot;software program&quot; dedundant?
</I>
 &gt; I would agree with this viewpoint: however, I fail to see where the term
 &gt; might have been used in the post which you quoted.
