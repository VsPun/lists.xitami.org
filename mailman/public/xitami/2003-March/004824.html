Indeed; I think it's to do with mindset.  Windows users are brain-washed
into believing that they need an &quot;application program&quot; to do any task.
Whereas those exposed to Unix realize that many tasks can be done by
stringing together the actions of a number of small tools.

The command-line side of things is, sadly, nowadays forgotten by a large
majority of computer users.  Click'n'drool is the way to go.

(And no, before anyone criticises my remarks as being those of a Unix
&quot;fanatic&quot;, I don't use it: I use OS/2, and have for many years used Unix
tools ported to that environment.  Last time I really used Unix would
have been ca.1982, using V7 on a PDP-11/60:-)

    &quot;We can no longer stand apart from Europe if we would.  Yet we are
    untrained to mix with our neighbours, or even talk to them&quot;.
                                              George Macaulay Trevelyan, 1919
