  Subject: Re: [Xitami] xitami and domain name


  Hello Tom,,,, :)


  OK,,,I have read the Router documetation again and I think I see the =
light!!!
  As you said:

        &quot;You have to configure the router to pass all traffic for port =
80 to the PC running=20
         Xitami.&quot;


  Once I tell the Router to pass all traffic to port 80 plus the current =
IP of the Xitami PC then two things look promising:

      1. All the unsolicited messages being recorded to the Lynksys =
LogViewer=20
         Incoming log file will now go to port 80 for the Xitami PC =
IP(???).

      2. This means I probably do not need a static IP for that PC as it =
already=20
         has a staic IP as it exists behind the Router(???)

         Also, the Xitami PC will not have to be exposed via the Routers =
DMZ to=20
         the Internet (????)

That's excatly right!
Please keep in mind that the Xitami machine IS exposed to the internet, =
but only Port 80. So if a hacker managed to hijack Xitami, he would have =
control over the machine via the Port 80 hole in the firewall.
But this is unlikely with Xitami, so I wouldn't lose to much sleep over =
it. :-)



  If this is the case what does Xitami do with a record that is not =
meant for Xitami (i.e.) not set up in the Xitami Virtual Hosts cfg =
files?=20

        o Does it simply throw it on the &quot;FLOOR&quot; so to speak????=20
        o Can these be recorded to a Xitami log file???

It will reject the request, and record it in a logfile if you so desire. =
I get several hundred requests a day which are trying to exploit various =
unpatched security holes in Microsoft IIS, and lesser amounts trying to =
exploit other webservers. Xitami refuses them and logs and error.


  Then the IP to use to register the Domain Name will probably be the IP =
of the Router. And, if this is the case then it appears I must work with =
my ISP to provide a static IP for the Router which as I understand is =
not a static IP.


Yes, that is correct.
But you can use a dynamic IP if you use a Dynamic DNS service. I don't =
know much about this myself, but I'm sure a search on Google for Dynamic =
DNS will turn up a bunch of info.


  THANKS for your time, help, and advise!!!! :)

I'm glad to help. Good luck!
Tom

    Hello Tom, :)

    Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!

    In your Reply for &quot;xitami and domain name&quot; you mentioned the =
following:

       &quot;Depending on your network topology, have you=20
        checked that Xitami is bound to all IP's?&quot;

    I have tried to find out how to &quot;BIND Xitami to all IPs&quot; using =
Searches on the Internet and the Xitami Document, but am not having any =
success.

  You correctly set it in your previous message. I just used general =
terms.

    Could you please give an example or point me to a link/document that =
describes binding Xitami?


    FYI,,,,I am a novice user of Xitami. Just loaded it last week and =
all seems to be working as expected on a LAN using 8 PCs (W95 and =
W98SE). Xitami is on a W98SE and I am learning and testing using the =
HOSTS file at each PC to force Domain Names to the I
    P address of the PC where Xitami is installed.=20

    Hosts file example:


                 xx.yy.zz.1  www.abc.com
                 xx.yy.zz.1  www.def.com
                        etc.

    These are not registered Domain Names and are used for testing. =
However, when Xitami is configured to depend on registerd names via =
Virtual Hosting, I suspect that I will have the same problem as =
described by <A HREF="mailto:shing@walla.co.il.">shing@walla.co.il.</A>=20

    I thought that using a registered Domain Name should have worked =
within shing's LAN. If the Domain Name is not in the HOSTS file I =
thought it would be routed to the www database (HOSTS file) at the DNS =
Server which would then route it to shing's IP wher
    e Xitami is installed. That is what I thought(????). I have been =
away from the net a long time (circa 1975) and there is a lot I have to =
learn.
  It should and does work as you described.=20

    BTW,,,,, all my PCs are behind a router with the NAT firewall, so I =
may also have to expose the Xitami PC to the Internet when Xitami is =
configured to start using registerd Domain Names(???).

    Thanks again for your time, help and advise!!!

    Jerry :)
  You can have Xitami behind the firewall. You have to configure the =
router to pass all traffic for port 80 to the PC running Xitami.

  Here's how the request process should work:
  Someone far away requests www.yourdomain.com. The appropriate DNS =
servers hand back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1 (These addresses =
are made up for this discussion). A request to port 80 of 192.168.0.1 =
for www.yourdomain.com is made, and Xitami returns the webpage.
  If you are running more than one domain name on Xitami, Xitami Virtual =
hosts will recognise which domain is being asked for, and supplies it.

  So now let's say you want to access the website from inside your =
network. You type is www.yourdomain.com. an appropriate outside DNS =
server hands back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1. Your PC says &quot;Hey! =
That's only one PC away from me!&quot; And connect directly to it.

  As you can see, it's exactly the same mechanism for being inside the =
network or outside the network.

  So what we are dealing with here is some other problem. If all the =
above works from the outside, but not the inside, it is almost certainly =
a firewall problem.
  If you are having problems with both the outside and the inside, it =
could be either DNS not configured properly, firewall not configured =
properly, or Xitami not configured properly.

  Hope this helps,
  Tom

made, and=20
  Xitami returns the webpage.&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;If you are running more than one domain name on Xitami, =
Xitami=20
  Virtual hosts will recognise which domain is being asked for, and =
supplies=20
  it.&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;So now let's say you want to access the website from =
inside your=20
  network. You type is &lt;A=20
  href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://www.yourdomain.com"">http://www.yourdomain.com&quot;</A>&gt;www.yourdomain.com&lt;/A&gt;. an =
appropriate=20
  outside DNS server hands back &lt;A=20
  href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://www.yourdomain.com"">http://www.yourdomain.com&quot;</A>&gt;www.yourdomain.com&lt;/A&gt; =3D =
192.168.0.1. Your PC=20
  says &quot;Hey! That's only one PC away from me!&quot; And connect directly to =
it.&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;As you can see, it's exactly the same mechanism for =
being inside=20
  the network or outside the network.&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;So what we are dealing with here is some other problem. =
If all=20
  the above works from the outside, but not the inside, it is almost =
certainly a=20
  firewall problem.&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;If you are having problems with both the outside and =
the inside,=20
  it could be either DNS not configured properly, firewall not =
configured=20
  properly, or Xitami not configured properly.&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;Hope this helps,&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;Tom&lt;/DIV&gt;
  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
