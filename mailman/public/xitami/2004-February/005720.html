<PRE>Hello,

And, Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!

I am a novice at using Xitami or any WEB Page Server and configuration. Just downloaded Xitami with a short test and all is working great on a Windows 95/98 LAN with 7 PCs connected via an 8 port HUB! The WEB page created in c:\xitami\webpages as default.htm can be read by the Browsers at all the PCs on this LAN.

I have been receiving the Xitami Emails for several years before this download and I feel that the following question is probably answered in those Emails. But, the last several years of these have been deleted to reclaim space on the disk.

I have been looking for an example and trying to structure the c:\xitami\webpages\*.htm directory and files for several URLs with no success.

For example:

   1. As a test, the HOSTS file was created with the following entry for each PCs on this LAN:

               10.10.10.7        www.abc.com

This works great and causes the c:\xitami\webpages\default.htm to be displayed at each PC that keys in the following on that PCs WEB browser:

              <A HREF="http://www.abc.com">http://www.abc.com</A>

I would like to add more entries to the HOSTS file for example:

           10.10.10.7         www.abc.com
           10.10.10.7         www.def.com
               .                 . 
             etc.               etc.

Plus, have their respective WEB pages for www.abc.com and www.def.com when those URLs are entered at the BROWSER.

If this can be accomplished via Xitami an example showing how to MAP web pages for 2 URLs would be a GREAT help and would help to show how more can be configured as required.

And,  THANKS for your time, effort, and advise!!!!

Jerry
