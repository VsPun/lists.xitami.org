There's another bit of light that you could also usefully see: how to
make an effective mailing.

I don't know what
|<i> X-Mailer: AT&amp;T Message Center Version 1 (Feb 13 2004)
</I>is, but it's generating invalid format messages, in that you are sending
MIME multipart/alternative _content_, but not correctly indicating this
in the headers.

Perhaps if you tell it to STOP sending mail in HTML format, which is
never welcome in a mailing list such as this, then things might get
better; this would also have the welcome side-effect of making your
messages considerably shorter.  Another way to do this would be to EXCISE
irrelevant and outdated material from that which you DO quote.

Talking of quoting, you are doing NOTHING to discriminate between that
which you quote and that which you add; this makes your posts even harder
to follow than necessary.


Here &lt;<A HREF="http://www.plig.net/nnq/nquote.html">http://www.plig.net/nnq/nquote.html</A>&gt; and also at
&lt;<A HREF="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/g.mccaughan/g/remarks/uquote.html">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/g.mccaughan/g/remarks/uquote.html</A>&gt; are a
couple of articles that describe why &quot;top-posting&quot; is a bad idea in news
articles; it applies equally well to mailing lists.  (Indeed, it could be
argued that it applies even more, in relation to not posting HTML,
because the latter is actually partially-tripping the &quot;spam detectors&quot; on
your mail, as evidenced if you look at the headers.)

There is a useful document describing how to prevent this in various
mailers &lt;<A HREF="http://www.camblab.com/nugget/htmlmail.pdf">http://www.camblab.com/nugget/htmlmail.pdf</A>&gt;, although it doesn't
seem to mention yours.
