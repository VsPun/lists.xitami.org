<PRE>Hi guys,

I've been running xitami on various Windows boxes for years now (NT4 first
-&gt; 2000 -&gt; and currently 2003) and have accumilated a large list of vhosts
(friends, family, etc). The thing is, I want to now shift over to a NetBSD
based machine and am trying to compile from source. The problem happens when
running the build.sh script - which generates a &quot;c: not found&quot; error. 

Looking through the mailing list archives, I found the thread quoted below
and also a mention of downloading base from www.imatix.net/pub and
extracting 'c' from there. I've downloaded base-1.2d7-src - but it doesn't
contain 'c'. Seeing as this thread was from May '06 - I'm guessing it's
changed since and been dropped?

Does anyone know how to get around this problem please?

Cheers!
Stuart

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I have an ANSI C compiler, several of them in fact, on both the

</I>&gt;<i> found the Downloads page and downloaded both copies of rbase. Guess
</I>&gt;<i> what? If you look in the boom sub-directory of either rbase archive
</I>&gt;<i> you will find the required &quot;c&quot; file. 8=)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, it's not in any FAQ I could find either. As to why it is this way,
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know, perhaps an intelligence test for developers or perhaps a
</I>&gt;<i> way of separating the wanna-be's from the developers? To get the real
</I>&gt;<i> answer you'll have to ask the developers at Imatix. My personal
</I>&gt;<i> opinion is that the developers don't want you to compile just xitami
</I>&gt;<i> but want you to compile the entire rbase package in order to gain it's
</I>&gt;<i> advantages.
