<PRE>Great, that's what I was hoping. No sense in going backwards. In the
meantime though. I have to see if there's anything I can do to keep
Xitami running on my customers sites. 

I have enabled debug logging a different site that crashed. It's the
service version of 2.4 d11, and one we built ourselves from the source.
I also got a crash log. I attached it. If it won't go through the list,
I will post it directly in an email.

Hi,

It looks like a crash in the socket reading code, this is an area that's
been totally rewritten and improved for the new product.
