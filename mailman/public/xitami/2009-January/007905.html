Yes just to add my two pennies worth &quot;Wonderful news for the new year to hear about Xitami 5&quot;  I have been a user on Windows since back with Win95 10 years ago.  The current version seems stable on a minimal XP installation - runs for days without errors.  I was just thinking I would have to soon look again at Apache but now I will wait.

Cheers,

This sounds fantastic, and am glad the Xitami torch will carry on.  Its been 
rock steady for years, has few limitations and still does the job better 
than Apache (apples to apples).  Heck, I even got a custom version of URL 
rewrites to work (converting dyanmic urls to static urls), something that is 
built into Apache but had to be bastardized to work with Xitami.

Anyway, I would like to contribute in anyway I can.  However, I don't 
believe I am the kind of sophisticated programmer that you need assisting in 
developing the various aspects of this new webserver.  I primarily do CGI, 
PHP and MySQL scripting.  But you need assistance with Admin forms and 
technical help pages or such, then let me know.

Keep me in mind if you can remember to do so.  :-)

  Hi All,

Happy new year for 2009.

It's been a while since we stopped working on Xitami/2.5.

Well, we've started on a new version of Xitami, which will be called
Xitami/5.  (Versions 3 and 4 were started, and dropped, internally.)

It'll be a while before this becomes a polished stand-alone product,
and that will only happen if people ask for it and help make it so.
Our main reason for restarting this concept is that we need a small,
tough server as the front-end for new web services we're making.

Xitami/5 will remind you a lot of Xitami: compact, efficient, and easy
to configure.  It won't have CGI or LRWP, unless someone helps make
this.  It's meant above all to be scalable on multicore boxes, secure
(it will have SSL support), and unhackable. It will run on most OSes
but we're not going to spend time making nice Win32 front-ends.  It
will run without ever crashing.

I've put a post on www.zyre.com (Zyre is the new web messaging service
we're making) that explains a little more.

Technical details: Xitami/5 uses the Base2 server framework we built
for OpenAMQ (www.openamq.org).  That gives us multithreading and a
nice development environment.

As we get code that works, and if there is interest, we'll put up a
new website.  In the meantime, we've put up a sample of the new
documentation here: <A HREF="http://xitami.wikidot.com/doc:xitami-5.">http://xitami.wikidot.com/doc:xitami-5.</A>
