Wow...

Thanks for the reply Hogan, but it's very clear by your response, that I
didn't do a very good job of describing my problem.  My apologies if I've
used bad grammar or terms incorrectly.  This is definitely a
software-related issue, and my guess is that it has something to do with a
minor Windows setting, rather than Xitami itself.  I have little experience
with Intel-based PCs, know absolutely nothing about hyper-thread technology,
and only mentioned the hardware in case there were any known issues.

The Xitami service ran perfectly for the first five days.  After the fifth
day, I became aware of a problem when I clicked a link to one of my domains
and got a &quot;server not found&quot; error.  There was no response from any of my
domains (or WBA) across the web, or locally.  After confirming there were no
firewall issues, I assumed that Xitami-service had crashed, and for some
reason, did not recover.

A visual inspection of the PC Xitami runs on, suggested everything was
running and functioning normally... including all other services and run
programs (dynamic dns client etc.).  I could even use the PC to check email,
or share files across the network (i.e. PC functioning correctly/Xitami
not).

The Xitami quick-start gadget that opens from the Xitami-icon in control
panel, says Xitami is still running at this point (and has one active
connection).  Windows-Services tells me Xitami is running, and no crash
activity has been logged (Xitami's logs), even though Xitami remains
non-responsive.

When I tell Windows-Services to stop Xitami, it goes into &quot;stopping mode&quot;,
but never actually completes the stop-action... even after 20 minutes of
waiting.  Eventually, the task manager is required to actually get Xitami
stopped.

If I try to restart the Xitami-service, this error message immediately
appears on my screen:

   Internet Explorer Script Error
       An Error has occurred in the script on this page.
   Line:    1
   Char:    1
   Error:    Unspecified error
   URL:    <A HREF="res://C:\WINDOWS\System32\mmcndmgr.dll/views.htm">res://C:\WINDOWS\System32\mmcndmgr.dll/views.htm</A>

(even though everything else running on this PC is still functioning
normally)

If I reboot the PC, Xitami comes back strong and hard and full of life, and
does everything Xitami is supposed to do, and very well.  Within 14 or 15
hours however, Xitami is back to being non-responsive again, and repeats the
exact same scenario I've just described.

My guess, is that I would probably have no problems at all, if I just
disabled the service and ran the Xitami GUI at startup.  Which is exactly
what I'm about to try, the moment this message is sent.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been running Xitami (trouble free) for the past six or seven
</I>&gt;<i> years (as a service), on a WinXP-Pro (32-bit) machine. However,
</I>&gt;<i> concerned about my aging hardware, I recently migrated Xitami to a
</I>&gt;<i> newly purchased (remarketed) machine... where I've replicated the
</I>&gt;<i> original software environment as closely as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    IBM Type 9210-KUA
</I>&gt;<i>    Pentium 4 3.2Ghz HyperThread
</I>&gt;<i>    2.0gb DDR2 ram
</I>&gt;<i>    500gb Sata hardrive
</I>&gt;<i>    WinXP-Pro SP2 (fully patched, WITHOUT IE-7)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Xitami v2.5c2 (as a service)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This new machine appeared to run flawlessly for the first five days,
</I>&gt;<i> at which point it began to hang... in a rather non-responsive kind of
</I>&gt;<i> way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What appears to be a crashed or dead Xitami does not get logged as
</I>&gt;<i> such... and Windows continues to report that the service is still
</I>&gt;<i> running.  If I attempt to stop the service, that hangs too... and
</I>&gt;<i> requires the use of the task-manager to actually take it down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At that point however, if I attempt to restart the Xitami service, I
</I>&gt;<i> get the following error:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Internet Explorer Script Error
</I>&gt;<i>        An Error has occurred in the script on this page.
</I>&gt;<i>    Line:    1
</I>&gt;<i>    Char:    1

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know how to make this stop?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks  :)
