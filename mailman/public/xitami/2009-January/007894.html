<PRE>Hi Pieter,

Happy new year to you too!

I just want to wish you guys the best of luck! Xitami/2.5 is a brilliant
webserver and does its job really well! Lightweight, efficient and has stood
the test of time! (I'm still using it since NT days even now - on a bunch of
2k3 boxes)

It's a shame about the CGI development with Xitami/5 though. Back in the
early days, it was a deciding factor of me using Xitami in the first place
(incidentally - VB CGI ftw!! I don't know if anyone else shares the same
'enthusiasm' for CGI VB? Thought not. lol!).

I'd love to help with CGI dev - but I think you're are a 'real' programmer
(not some VB'er!). But once again, god speed guys! It's great to know that
Xitami isn't dead yet!!

Hi All,

Happy new year for 2009.

It's been a while since we stopped working on Xitami/2.5.

Well, we've started on a new version of Xitami, which will be called
Xitami/5.  (Versions 3 and 4 were started, and dropped, internally.)

It'll be a while before this becomes a polished stand-alone product,
and that will only happen if people ask for it and help make it so.
Our main reason for restarting this concept is that we need a small,
tough server as the front-end for new web services we're making.

Xitami/5 will remind you a lot of Xitami: compact, efficient, and easy
to configure.  It won't have CGI or LRWP, unless someone helps make
this.  It's meant above all to be scalable on multicore boxes, secure
(it will have SSL support), and unhackable. It will run on most OSes
but we're not going to spend time making nice Win32 front-ends.  It
will run without ever crashing.

I've put a post on www.zyre.com (Zyre is the new web messaging service
we're making) that explains a little more.

Technical details: Xitami/5 uses the Base2 server framework we built
for OpenAMQ (www.openamq.org).  That gives us multithreading and a
nice development environment.

As we get code that works, and if there is interest, we'll put up a
new website.  In the meantime, we've put up a sample of the new
documentation here: <A HREF="http://xitami.wikidot.com/doc:xitami-5.">http://xitami.wikidot.com/doc:xitami-5.</A>
