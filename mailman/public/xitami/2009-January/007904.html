<PRE>I am also a loyal Xitami user with about 20 virtual sites running not to
mention maybe 100 or 150 virtual subdomain sites. Xitami handles them all
quite well. 

Primarily the major concern is for it to be more stable running on MS Vista
and the new flavors of Windows 7 and versions of MS Windows server. I'm not
a Linux person. Xitami constantly crashes on Vista, in fact it also crashed
on XP and I had to run Always Up to restart it when it crashed. On Vista
Always Up will restart it half of the time and sometimes it's down for 8
hours or more before I can get to it. I'm not a programmer so I don't know
how or why that is and what can be done about it. 

The second issue I have is minor for me but something I'd like to see, and
that is the ability to run ASP. I have had customers go with someone else
because I don't have ASP capability. 

Oh and very minor is the Mod ReWrite like Apache.  

Something else that Apache has is integrated PHP, MySQL and some flavors
throw in ASP. Man that would make Xitami the ultimate web server. 

But all in all I still love Xitami and refuse to even try anything else. I
can have a new site up and running in a matter of minutes even quicker if I
use my batch file to quickly set up the new site. I don't use the GUI
although I might consider a PHP GUI if it was better designed. Apache has
some interesting GUI Interfaces designed for it.


My 2 cents,


Thank you,
Ron
