This will fire if "file_name" in the tcb is NULL.

What happens if you use:

<!--#include file="..\cgi-bin\last_post.txt" -->
or
<!--#include file="..\\cgi-bin\\last_post.txt" -->
or
<!--#include file="/cgi-bin/last_post.txt" -->
or
<!--#include file="\cgi-bin\last_post.txt" -->
or
<!--#include file="\\cgi-bin\\last_post.txt" -->

Instead?

The information you gave here says that the real error is somewhere up the
stack and may have something to do with the relative path information (..)
and/or the forward or backslash.  You may be able to hack around the bug by
using one of the options above, switching to absolute paths, or something
equivalent.

>    /* Check if file is not already open
  */
>    if (sym_get_value (tcb-> open_file, tcb-> file_name, NULL) != NULL)

This is where the crash will likely happen.  sym_get_value will likely try
to dereference file_name, which is NULL, and throw the exception all the
way back to the OS, where the kernel will kill the program that tried to
blue-screen the OS.  If running as a NT service, the NT service manager
will note that Xitami stopped/died and restart it automatically up to 3
times in any session.

If it doesn't crash here, then fopen() will surely crash.  I've not seen a
library implementation that defended against NULL filenames.

What I was doing above is having you try different combinations of file
names as a workaround to ultimately get tcb->file_name to not be NULL and
therefore not crash in this function.

Thomas,

Thanks much.  It indeed has to do with the relative path (..) 
Whenever that is not present in the path to the document, it doesn't
crash.  But it also doesn't include the file. That's if I use:

#Include file="etc.".  

However, if I use: 

#include virtual="etc."

everything is hunky dory, even WITH the relative "../cgi-bin/etc.". 
This isn't how SSI works under Apache on FreeBSD, which is how my
website is actually hosted.  I just use the Xitami for offline
development.  Any speculation from anyone familiar with perlssi as to
why the different syntax?
 
Thanks for responding, and pointing me in the right direction.

Hi,
For some reason, when someone tries to download one of
my files, (80MB), the file transfer stops after a
seemingly random amount of time.  I can't see what is
happening from the debug logs, but when it is accessed
the log says timeout=300.
Thanks for the help,
Joey

Subject: [Xitami] Limiting Bandwidth - How to Use Pipe Settings?
Message-ID: <001001c4c28c$6cd70f60$c800140a@bigmamma>

Hi,

I've read through the FAQ and help, but I can't figure out how to make use 
of the Pipe settings to limit bandwidth.

I want to limit the bandwidth so I can see how my project will run over 
various connections.  When I try to select an HTTP throttle pipe from the 
configuration screen it never saves my selection.  Ideally I would like to 
limit it even further then 32k.

I am not worried about segmenting the bandwidth among sites,  a global 
setting will work fine for me.

I imagine this is pretty simple to do, once you know the right steps to 
take. If anyone could provide me those steps I would really appreciate it.

I am on an XP machine.  Running Xitami 2.5c2


Thanks for your time,
Adam

Hello Adam,

I haven't done that, but I would try to edit the default.cfg directly. Here the section out of the 
xitami.cfg.

#   Specifies the HTTP throttle pipe. With a throttle pipe you can
#   restrict the throughput of a website to some fixed maximum, e.g.
#   64Kbps. This can be useful if several websites share a single
#   line, and you need to share this on a quality-of-service basis.
#   The HTTP throttle pipe is applied to all download and upload
#   requests to the website. You can apply a throttle pipe to the
#   entire HTTP server or to specific virtual hosts. Pipes are defined
#   in the XML file 'pipedef.xml'. You can edit this file to add new
#   pipes; Xitami reloads this automatically after a short delay. Each
#   pipe is defined as several 'instances', which are simply
#   individual pipes that share the same characteristics. For example,
#   the default pipedef.xml file defines several pipes with a 64Kbps
#   throughput. These are individual instances of a 64Kpbs pipe. All
#   transfers that use a specific pipe instance share the bandwidth of
#   that pipe instance.

    pipe=

#   Specifies the throttle pipe definition file. This is an XML file
#   that follows a specific format - look at pipedef.xml for an
#   explanation. If you define your own throttle pipes, it's a good
#   idea to copy pipedef.xml to something else (e.g. 'mypipes.xml')
#   and then change that. This avoids unpleasant surprises when you
#   upgrade your Xitami version. Note that we may change the format of
#   the pipe definition file in the future.

    pipedef=pipedef.xml

If you want to make changes to that, make them in your default.cfg. After editing and the saving 
the default.cfg the changes should take affect. I experienced similar problems when working with 
the "admin gui" and just edited the file and the settings did take effect.

Thanks Johannes!

That did it.  I was actually playing around with configuration files 
previously but I didn't get the right syntax.

After several tries I stumbled upong the correct syntax.

The correct syntax is
   pipe = "32k pipe"  #basically the instance name defined in the XML with 
quotes around it.

Thanks for your help!

Adam

I have just noticed a weird event in the log file tracking on Xitami 2.5

I am completely missing log files for all days between Oct. 17 through Oct. 21
Has this happened to anyone else and what caused it???

Thanks.

Didn't happen here, but can't tell you what caused this. Sorry.

Try checking Oct. 16th's or Oct. 22's logs.  I haven't seen Xitami fail to
log information, but I have seen it fail to roll over the logs to the next
day and accumulate 5-10 days worth before realizing it needs to roll over.
I'm pretty sure those logs should be somewhere...

My best guess (without looking at source code), the logs fail to roll over
when there is activity on the server at the exact moment the logs should
roll over - so the date never gets calculated to indicate a new file and
the current file just expands until the next day.  A DoS of sorts might be
able to be performed indirectly by forcibly expanding the logs every day
using a remote attack client.  When someone goes to open the logs with
something other than a 'tail'-like tool, it could drag RAM to a minimum and
CPU utilization to 100%.

I think it's perhaps caused by a simple slow reaction in Xitami when the 
load is a bit upped on the server.
I have several days worth which roll over several times a day and then days 
that don't get their own log files so that would explain it.

Thanks.

Hi -
I've been using Xitami 2.5b4 on xp for several months now to test cgi =
scripts
locally before uploading them to my webhosts' servers.

But after a three month hiatus, I returned to test and found an error
message, instead -
Cannot create CGI process - program not found
which is odd, because I can run the testcgi.exe with no problems.

Yes, the Path to Perl has remained the same...any clues as to what's
going on, here?  My Perl installation is also intact; I've got no idea!

Thanks,
El

I recently helped a friend install Xitami 2.5c2 on a pc running XP. Everything was working perfectly until yesterday. Users trying to connect to his ftp service are presented with this error:

Connecting to 83.70.231.6:21
Connected to 83.70.231.6:21 in 0.170244 seconds, Waiting for Server Response

Failed to receive response after connect
Host type (1): Automatic Detect

I double checked his network and router configuration. Everything is ok there. He can access the http and ftp servers locally. It's just access from the net that is receiving the error. After prodding him a little further it turns out he enabled XP's built in firewall(not sure why he did this, his router uses NAT) right before his server went south. Ah, hah, I figured, easy fix. He insists on keeping his firewall enabled, so I had him configure it
to allow HTTP an FTP to no avail. After that failed I had him disable the firewall, still nothing. Users are still receiving the same error. I was positive XP's firewall was the issue. Does anyone know what could be causing this. I've been using xitami for four years on my own machine, but in no way claim to be an expert. I'm stumped. 

Thanks in advance for any help!

I would recommend your friend dumps the XP firewall and installs Zonealarm 
instead.
Zonealarm claims it's not made for servers but in fact it works just fine.
It is on top of that a build of outpost for linux somehow as it reports 
itself to be the same.

Now, for the configuration, go into Advanced and allow odd servers to run 
under high security,
and then specify that port 80 and other standard access rights are ok. Then 
you should be set.

XP's firewall has little to no ability to specify any distinct settings and 
if it's only SP 1 then it's pretty much not worth anything anyway.
I had a few guys compare security on firewalls and it took them about 10 
minutes to get through all standard Windows firewalls but a NAT is 
something different.
It can be broken but will take them 4 - 6 hours and is so much easier to 
detect.

Hi -
Yes, I've run the same scripts from other programs like
Crimson Editor and Cgi Test in order to make sure it
wasn't the script, itself.  Plus, some of these were old
stand-by's that have worked in the past...

All looks okay in the default.config file as for settings,
my Perl installation and !# shebang are pointing correctly -
it's just that Xitami "Cannot create the cgi process" anymore!

[Which makes no sense since cgitest.exe runs just fine.]

Any other ideas / suggestions?
Do I smell a re-install on the horizon :- [  ?

Thanks for the help! 

I'm not sure how he did it or why, but he deleted his ftproot directory along with a few others. Unfortunately he's 2,000 miles
away so it took all day to figure it out. Just when I had given up
the statement, "could this have anything to do with it?" appeared on
my screen. Ahhhh, shoot me.

So now the connection issue is solved. Somewhere along the way his NAT config must of went sour though. I can connect to Xitami without any issues. I get the normal welcome screen, 
but as soon as Xitami switches the data connection port to 200 it 
hangs. I'm assuming we need to create a pinhole through his router
to open 200. I'm curious to know why it worked fine for two weeks 
with the current config, but now all of sudden it's blocked.

Anyway, thanks again for the help! It's really appreciated!

I have Xitami running on a win2kpro pc, and recently I discoverd thousands
of pipexxxx.flt files in my temp directory. Basically 1 file for each page
visited. It appears to only happen with PHP pages and not HTML pages. Here
is what I have ruled out.

I haver ruled out
html pages
cookies
MySQL
anything in domain.cfg
I didn't see anything in the php.ini

I creates a incremental file for each page visited.

So does Xitami have anything to do with creating a temp file called
pipe0001.flt   that's FLT. Which looks to me to be a filter file.
At the moment I have created a batch file to delete *.flt but I would rather
whatever creates it to either not create it or remove it when it's done.

Thanks
Ron

Yes.  Xitami uses a temporary file for the output from PHP or any other
filter application (Nuclear Vision, Perl, ColdFusion, counter programs,
etc.).  Here is how it works behind the scenes:

1)  Create a new temporary file with a FLT extension (flt = filter - you
should be able to see the relationship between the INI configuration
section called [filters] and the file extension FLT).
2)  If it is a POST request, create another temporary file that contains
the POST request data.
3)  Start the application (e.g. php.exe) with output piped to the temporary
file (and an optional input file pipe).
4)  Wait for the application to finish.  If it times out, it may not get to
the next two steps.
5)  Open the file and dump the contents to the web client (e.g. IE,
Mozilla, Firefox).
6)  Once the dump is complete, close the file and delete it.

It is possible to get FLT files to stick around beyond their appropriate
lifetime by writing scripts that timeout or during a DoS of the CGI filters
(just sending 60 requests per second or so might be able to do that -
Xitami gets "confused" with that rate of page requests).  They could be a
security risk for SSL-enabled connections if you display the credit card
information back to the user and other people have access to the system as
the information will be saved to the hard drive temporarily.  This isn't
meant to scare you - I'm just providing a few friendly heads-up tips.

Wouldn't a hardware router be better?  It doubles as a firewall and adds an
extra layer that doesn't have a visible OS under it.  I've been under the
general impression that software-based firewalls only somewhat work, but
I've not heard of anyone with a hardware router and a solidly closed
network (i.e. only port 80 open on the outside) having problems.  I tried
ZoneAlarm out myself once and wasn't too impressed (it worked, but it
wasn't easy to use), but that was two years ago.  I don't know why, but I
feel "safer" with a fairly decent, web configurable hardware router than
sitting directly on the Internet hoping everything on the software firewall
works fine.  I'm probably being confidently geeky because shiny hardware is
supposed to be impressive.

Good info, now how do I fix it?
It is leaving every page visited in the pipexxxx.flt temp file on the
server. Is this a problem with Xitami or PHP?

It really depends on your setup.  It sounds like you might have a really
complex setup, so it might help to try something simple first like a simple
PHP page that does nothing but spit back an '<? echo "hi\n"; ?>' to the
client.  The next thing I would do is take the server off the Internet for
a minute or two to try the same tests locally to rule out a bunch of people
just requesting pages.  If you have a really high-volume site that can't go
down, that's probably your problem and you can't do much about it unless
you want to learn C/C++ and edit the source code.  I'm pretty sure Xitami
will simply overwrite the FLT files when it loops back around to
pipe0000.flt.  If you want, you can always set up some script that
regularly goes through the directory and cleans out the FLT files.
NT-based OSes will stop the process when you hit a file in use.

>It is leaving every page visited in the pipexxxx.flt temp file on the

This is likely a Xitami issue except for if you have long-running PHP
processes (30 seconds or more).  If PHP did this, you would hear everyone
hollering about it on Slashdot.

One question that just popped into my head:  Did you accidentally turn on
the "log CGI page requests" option in the configuration?  I seem to recall
that the option keeps around the FLT files in that case and seems to be
what you are describing.

I've tried a very short php file and id dosn't seem to make a difference on
the size. I do have sites that get quite a bit of traffic especially when
the spiders hit it. No I don't know C/C++ so I will just do a batch file
activated by WinCron for now. But I think this is something that should be
addressed by someone who can fix Xitami. Since each pipexxxx.flt is between
15 and 30kb I now understand why I kept seeing my drive fill up considering
in the time it took me to write this it used 1mb of drive space.

Unfortunately that is rather out of date -- it has the archives from
1997 through mid-2001 when the list was hosted there.

The archives since then are at:

http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/

linked from:

http://lists.xitami.org/mailman/listinfo/xitami

which is on the bottom of each post to teh list.
