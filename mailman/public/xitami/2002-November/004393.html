<PRE>I have had several xitami crashes on a pentium 133 running win2000. Of
cource, knowing that the system was probably too slow, I upgraded to an AMD
550 and the crashes don't happen several times a day, but about once a week.
I have a friend who has a pentium 3 450 who says he has crashes every day,
and he is changing to the apatchi software. is there anything that can be
done to minimize crashes under win2k?

Hello Paul,


Possible but I doubt it would be because of AMD, I have been using amd
with xitami for over 5 years....

Monday, November 4, 2002, 11:18:40 AM, you wrote:

&gt;&gt;<i>  so maybe its an amd thing ...anyone out there seeing this on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-AMD machines ?
</I>
PR&gt; Yes, at about the same rate: once or twice a year.

PR&gt; My current main server is AMD K6/2 350 and runs very solid in 256M
PR&gt; of RAM. My previous box was Intel P-133 and 32Meg and also ran
PR&gt; solid. I have run Xitami on a 386SX-16 with 4Megs... Win3.11's TCP
PR&gt; stack sucked but Xitami never gave any trouble even on a machine too
PR&gt; lame to surf its own pages.

PR&gt; Don't use any Win9x unless you really know Win9x well. Use one of
PR&gt; the NTs (or of course OS/2 or Unix if you wish).

PR&gt; On NT, NTFS is marginally more stable than FAT.

PR&gt; I agree about not running user-programs on a webserver. Often this
PR&gt; works fine, but sometimes not.

PR&gt; Do not expect the tray-icon version of Xitami to stay up. It does
PR&gt; for some people, but many folks report that it crashes/locks for
PR&gt; them. USE THE NT SERVICE version for any long-running server. I do
PR&gt; use the tray-icon jobbie for quick-checking stuff on my home
PR&gt; machine, but not for any server I am going to walk away from.

&gt;&gt;<i> Can you switch to the service without screwing anything up
</I>
PR&gt; I have no idea; never did that. I believe all the CFG files are
PR&gt; identical so it &quot;should&quot; work. But copy your CFG files to a safe
PR&gt; place first. The Service Installer does not always work; drop to a
PR&gt; command line and run the exe manually to see how to Install directly.

&gt;&gt;<i> I recently purchased a &quot;blower&quot; ... supposed to move about 12 cfm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of air.
</I>
PR&gt; If the machine is truly over-heating, 12CFM is like being in the
PR&gt; desert and fanning yourself with a matchbook. Anything less than
PR&gt; 45-60CFM in a case is wishful thinking.

PR&gt; First find out if the machine IS hot. Set it up exactly as it
PR&gt; normally runs (covers on(*), jammed in a corner, cat laying against the
PR&gt; case vents, whatever) and let it run all morning. Shut-down, rip the
PR&gt; cover off. Keep one hand on the metal case and use the other to
PR&gt; carefully feel around. For a long-running server, I like everything
PR&gt; so un-hot that I could keep my hand on it forever without pain. Once
PR&gt; you know what's hot, you can then begin to think about a fix.

PR&gt; However if Windows is staying up while Xitami locks, it is unlikely
PR&gt; to be CPU overheating (hot RAM is possible).

PR&gt; (*) Some machines run cooler covers-on, some run cooler with
PR&gt; covers-off. No easy way to guess. I have some PPro-200s in service
PR&gt; that are rock-solid covers-on, but cover-off will get flaky in 3 or
PR&gt; 4 hours. So test it the way it normally lives.
