<PRE>Hi,

Alternatively, there is recovery feature under the service administration of
Win2k which does exactly what you want. There are 3 failure steps that can
be set up to restart/run a file/reboot the computer and also a &quot;give-up&quot;
period of time as well as other nice features like sending a message in the
LAN just before booting.

Good luck
Stefan


Hey all, I am still having an occasional lock up on Xitami (running on a AMD
K6-2 400MHz, 256 megs of RAM, Win2K with SP3). What I am wondering is:

#1. Is there a way to use something like Task Scheduler or a 3rd party
program to recover from a failure and restart Xitami?

#2. Same as above, but how about just a re-boot of the system?

I am sure someone has to be doing something like this.

I ask because I am going to be working out of town quite a bit between now
and the end of the year and will not be home enough to just manually recover
from something like this.

Thanks for any help you folks can provide!

Mike
