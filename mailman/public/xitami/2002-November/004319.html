<PRE>  I had a question regarding the running of CGI under Xitami.  I was running the Windows 
version of Xitami (latest beta) on Windows NT 4 server (my system for CGI) using active perl.   
During this time I we ran a Oekaki BBS (a BBS for posting art) and it ran fine.  However Xitami 
was crashing a lot and not recovering and it always seemed to be when a different perl BBS 
(UBBS) script was called.   

So I switched to the console version of Xitami (latest beta) and copied my defaults.cfg over.  
Things seemed to run much more stable and perl scripts (mainly UBBS) didn't crash anymore.  

However the Oekaki BBS script now runs different.  We can post msg to the board but the 
picture accompanying the msg would not show up.  We also can not upload picture as 
attachment with the msg.

I figure there may be a CGI setting that I missed perhaps?  Can anyone offer suggestions for 
CGI/Perl settings to get my Oekaki working again?

Thanks for any insight!  Gene Angel
