Looks like your right, this answer from support just came in.
You would think they might mention this in the docs some place.
I wasted a lot of time thinking I had things set up wrong. :-(

RE: SpeedStream 2614 blocking web server?

 Bob,
    All fo the information of hits to the firewall from the WAN side should
be located in the &quot;Security Log&quot; on the status page of the router's web
interface.

[Nothing but LAN info is in that log?  I asked them about that in my respons.]

    As far as accessing the web server from the WAN side, there are several
different variable that could lead to an inability to connect through the
router.

   1.  Make sure that you are trying to access the WEB server from a
computer that is NOT within the LAN.  The Small Office / Home Office Routers
do not have the capability of accessing it's own public IP address from a
client within the Local area network.
[Why?]

   2.  Also,  make sure that you are attempting to access the Web server
using the WAN, or Public IP address (Ip address assigned by your ISP).
This should grant you access to your web server.
[I was.]

Thank you for your inquiry!
