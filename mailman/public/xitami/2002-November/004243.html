<PRE>Hi folks,

I just thought I would add my 2 cents worth to this as I have exactly the
same problem and have basically had it for so long I don't remember when it
started.

My machine has undergone many changes and is now an amd 1200 with 256 megs
ram.

I note that crashes only seem to happen when the machine has been running
for long periods without reboot which might indicate that it is running out
of ram or failing to release it.

I also note that 9 times out of 10 there is no error log but in the actual
server log there is always crap sometimes just blank space and other times
it looks like the mail server has dumped it contents into the web server
log.

Because the problem didn't go away when I updated from 128 megs ram to 265 I
doubt it is ram and suspect there is something wrong with the logging system
and the error message just quoted seems to point to the same thing.

Is anyone else seeing crap in their logs when it crashes ?
