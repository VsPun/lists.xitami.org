<PRE>I have the crashing problem as well.

On average it crashes once per week.  There is no set pattern.  It crashed
on me last night at around 10:30pm.  The crash recovery option is on, but
doesn't seem to work.  If anything, it seems to crash more at night than in
the day.

I have win2k prof, (clean install, and argosoft email) and all recent OS
updates / SP's.  The machine is not used for anything else.  I get about 50
web visitors a day.

In my case, the crash log in the xitami directory has an entry in it, and as
well, the Dr Watson log has an entry in it.  It seems to be an access
violation.

I run a simple site, HTML pages only, no ODBC or anything like that.  What I
did notice however, was that a visitor was at the site at the moment it
crashed.  A series of HTTP GETs were being processed. (page loads).  When I
look into that further, I might narrow the problem a bit.  I don't think
this visitor did anything out of the norm though.

No matter what it is though, I think it's a bug rather than a config issue.

Later today, I think I will fully document this issue including all logs and
all evidence that I have and make a bug report out of it.

Best Regards,
Rob Allen

Hi,

Just adding some thoughts to this thread. I run XiPro 4d10 on NT4 SP6 and
the only crashes I experienced (very few) were related either to the FTP or
to SSL.  The server load is small and I sometimes not boot the machine for
months.

I am also using XiPro on my workstation for testing/developing. For a while
I tried to follow some advice and work as a power user rather than an
administrator on my workstation. I noticed that Xitami behaves really
strange when one (as power user) tries to even open the setup dialog. This
did not last long since I use to do a lot of admin stuff/debugging on my
workstation and I assumed that xitami code was not developed with access
rights in mind for Win2k (as some other new software does) and speculate
that there might be crashes related to this when one plays with the access
rights on folders/files. Occasionally I use ODBC and these applications do
crash sometimes, however, the webserver is not affected, only the connected
LRWP process dies.
