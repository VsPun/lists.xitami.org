<PRE>Hello Philip,


I use mailform and it works great!  Go to google and do a search for
mailform.  I canot remember the exact URL as the software has been
working great for 2 years now and have never had to go back to their
website  ;-)

PVC&gt; hello
PVC&gt; I have been using the Xitami webserver for over 3 years now (P1 166 with 64 Mb Ram , sharing the machine with a software router/firewall and acting as printserver .. and Xitami is working great
PVC&gt; - the machine is probably rebooted every 3 months due to Win2000 updates ).
PVC&gt; I got Ikonboard (2.18) running (as BBS) and also I have a couple of virtual hosts running but now I want to create a simple page for feedback for one of the hosts. The feedback form should
PVC&gt; either create an HTML page to be picked op or even better simply send a mail with the collected info (name, email, telephone number and a text box for say 300 char) to a predefined email
PVC&gt; address. As Xitami does not support FrontPage extensions I have been looking for simple code (I have Perl somewhere located :-)). I saw the SendMail program but I have no clue how to use it ...
PVC&gt; is it possible to get some help? If it is necessary to upgrade the perl environment to the latest that is not a problem. It has been a long time I programmed but I still understand the basics
PVC&gt; and a bit more :-)

PVC&gt; thanks

PVC&gt; Philip
