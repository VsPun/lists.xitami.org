<PRE>&gt;<i> anyway at all to hide my ip address from users who access the page.
</I>
No.

To see your page, the browser has to send a request to your IP.
There are no names (like &quot;www.joc.com&quot;) on the internet; everything
HAS to go by IP number. Browsers and DNS systems allow users to surf
by names instead of numbers, but that is a convenience. Any savvy
surfer can find your IP number from your website name.

Having a &quot;known&quot; IP number is probably the least of your worries.
Even if you never tell anybody your IP number, even if you somehow
get an IP number not registered in any DNS, there are tools to probe
IP addresses in sequence or random, whether or not they are actually
in use.

Likewise, surfers can't hide their IP number from you. Their IP
numbers are in your server logs. With proxies and re-writes, the
logged IP may not be the same machine they sit at, but they HAVE to
give a clear path back to themselves so that your server can send
them the page they requested.
