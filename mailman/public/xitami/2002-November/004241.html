<PRE>Well, Mike, I don't know if this will help you, but we were having (and, 
from time to time, still do...) this same problem.  We found that 
increasing the RAM from 128Mb to 512Mb decreased the drop-off by 
75%.  I understand that this really doesn't conincide with any of the 
other suggestions anyone has offered, but, when it seems that many of 
us are having this problem, and all the community can do is suggest 
&quot;wives tales and home remedies&quot;.... you try what gets the job done, eh?

I think the memory helped us, since this one box runs the web, ftp, mail, 
and one of the video servers.  Even at 512Mb, this box is taxed!  
Nonetheless, since there have been so many of us who have 
experienced this type of crashing, it would be interesting to at least 
discover what is causing the problem.  Then, we can figure out a 
solution.  Process.

Brad Smith.
