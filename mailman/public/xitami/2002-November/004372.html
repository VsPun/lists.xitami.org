<PRE>I have an update here on my Xitami crashing problem.

I have disabled APM (Advanced Power Management) on the Web Server system and
disabled the hard drives going to sleep after an hour.  Since doing that
several weeks ago, Xitami hasn't crashed since.

The reason I suspected this was because, Xitami only ever seemed to crash at
night once the system would more likely be in a lower power state.

So far, so good.

Best Regards,
Rob Allen

Possibly a permission issue ? Does Xitami have permissions to
all resources ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In my case, the crash log in the xitami directory has an entry in it, and
</I>as
&gt;<i>well, the Dr Watson log has an entry in it.  It seems to be an access
</I>&gt;<i>violation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I run a simple site, HTML pages only, no ODBC or anything like that.  What
</I>I
&gt;<i>did notice however, was that a visitor was at the site at the moment it
</I>&gt;<i>crashed.  A series of HTTP GETs were being processed. (page loads).  When I
</I>&gt;<i>look into that further, I might narrow the problem a bit.  I don't think
</I>&gt;<i>this visitor did anything out of the norm though.
