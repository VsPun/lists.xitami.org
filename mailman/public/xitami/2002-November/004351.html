<PRE>Isn't this similar to the Domain Masking site's like
Tripod/Angelfire/Geocities use when someone buys a domain and applies it
against their homepage there...

Instead of the standard urls (username.tripod.com)the main page appears as
www.mynewlamedomain.com. That new domain name then sticks in the browser as
you navigate through the site (not changing to the actual url,
username.tripod.com/bikini_pics.com etc...).

If you can figure out how to do that, you could buy another domain name, and
users would think they were there instead of on your site... don't know if
that's what you're after or not.

btw, I subscribe to a lot of list-serves, and I almost ALWAYS make my first
question a joke... It gives me some insight into who on the list is trying
to be helpful, and who is not.

Michael.

Hi,
Just keep in mind that almost everything is possible. The only variable is
how much time and effort you want to invest in making it possible. As you
grow from a newbie to a more advanced user you'll eventually find out.

Stefan

Not a joke. Depends on how u see it.  Newbie question. sorry.
    I just wondered if there was a way so they didnt see the ip address in
the address bar.  Guess its not possibly.
    Sorry

Hello all./ newbie question here.  I have set up an Xitami server and was
curious if there was anyway at all to hide my ip address from users who
access the page.
    Thanks to anyone who has any thoughts.
        Cheers

This is supposed to be a joke, isn't it?
