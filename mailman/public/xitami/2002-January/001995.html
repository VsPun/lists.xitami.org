<PRE>I was using Zonealarm but Mindspring gave me a free copy of Norton Personal
Firewall. I also think that I should have a firewall. I only uninstalled it
the once to see if it made a difference.

Is there a way to find out if port 80 is blocked with the ISP? Is this
something I can ask them? The only thing about this question is that some
people can get in every time.

I haven't tried to redirect it to another port such as 4080, which I can do
through the router setup and Xitami.

I only run Xitami without any of the addons. The family tree software spits
out the webpages so I can copy them into the webpages directory and have
them available.

Ok, a few things here:

First off you should always have a firewall ESPECIALLY if your on a
broadband
connection. My suggestion the freeware ZoneAlarm (www.zonealarm.com)  is
both
easy to use and install.

Second, I use both dynamic ip addresses on my server as well as my server
not
being dedicated and it acts JUST fine.

I use ZoneEdit (www.zoneedit.com) and the DirectUpdate engine for updating
the ip address. There have been no problems OTHER than the fact that most
isp's block port 80, forcing me to redirect all port 80 traffic to port 4080
which I accomplished easily using ZonEedit.

Now, as far as the speed of xitami is concerned, yes it's fast but a fast
webserver gets easily bogged down once you start to add things like PHP,
MySQL or ASP emulation. So depending on how much use you are getting out of
it and how fast your dsl is, it better to be safe than sorry.

Just my 2 cents.
