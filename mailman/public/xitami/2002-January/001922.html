Apart from the more-firewall-friendly aspect, I feel that you are being
more than a little unfair on both FTP and its implementors.
(Particularly in referring to Jon Postel as a &quot;grad student&quot;.)

Might I remind you of the following (from RFC-1123, dated October 1989)?

         The File Transfer Protocol FTP is the primary Internet standard
         for file transfer.  The current specification is contained in
         RFC-959 [FTP:1].

         FTP uses separate simultaneous TCP connections for control and
         for data transfer.  The FTP protocol includes many features,
         some of which are not commonly implemented.  However, for every
         feature in FTP, there exists at least one implementation.  The
         minimum implementation defined in RFC-959 was too small, so a
         somewhat larger minimum implementation is defined here.

         Internet users have been unnecessarily burdened for years by
         deficient FTP implementations.  Protocol implementors have
         suffered from the erroneous opinion that implementing FTP ought
         to be a small and trivial task.  This is wrong, because FTP has
         a user interface, because it has to deal (correctly) with the
         whole variety of communication and operating system errors that
         may occur, and because it has to handle the great diversity of
         real file systems in the world.

It was RFC-1123 (aka STD-3), incidentally, which first standardized
certain extensions to FTP, such as PASV.  There are also more recent RFCs
which amplify 959, including at least three which have the status of
&quot;proposed standard&quot;.
