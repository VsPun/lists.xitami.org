Please DON'T do this: plain ASCII is perfectly adequate for mailing list
mails: no one wants to see the indetical content wrapped up in needless
swathes of HTML as well as the ASCII version.

So find the setting in your mailer that says &quot;send messages as plain text
only&quot;.

&gt;<i> You seem to have more than one problem. Checking your DNS record I find =

Duh!

You seem to have a problem too!  Addresses in the range [192.168.0.0] to
[192.168.255.255] are PRIVATE ones, which are explicitly not routable.
(See RFC-1918.)

If you're getting a reply to the ping, then YOUR network must have a
machine with the identity [192.168.1.5] --- it goes nowhere near Spyman's
system

You also have another problem, in that you've failed to excise anything
from Spyman's message: you ought to quote only sufficient to provide a
background for your reply, so really the precepts applicable to news will
work: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html">http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html</A>&gt; provides good
guidance on how to quote in news articles, and is a good paradigm for
mailing lists too.

That's where the HTML crap started.
