   I'm not sure that we are talking about the same thing. I'm refering
to the outside lines, not the inside lines. The ones that come in to
the box from off the street. Simple test is pick up your phone
receiver and listen to it. If you here static, then U have a bad
ground. If while U talk to somebody U hear static the cause is a bad
ground more than likely. Like I said the connection coming into your
house, and not the inside line. There should be at least 3 feet of 3/8
inch copper rod driven into the ground for your telephone service
connection, properly secured and tightly fitted to a wire that leads
into your telephone box. If it's connected to a cold water pipe, or
something similar it can cause all kinds of comm problems.

   Since Sprint DSL comes in through your phone line, I can only
assume the same principle applies. I'm a technician, not an engineer
I work according to application, and not theory.

   Who knows, maybe I'm wrong, but then my phone lines, and DSL
work just fine. However, they didn't when I first bought the house
over 10 years ago. I had to have my box tested and serviced by
the tele-co before I got rid of the static. The reason for the test
was because I was using a modem, and was losing the connection
or getting gobbldy gook for IBM-ANSI characters all the time.

I hope this clarifies things..

ITL, Bruce
