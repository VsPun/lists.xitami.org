<PRE>[ xitami stability good, only trouble with FTP ]
PR&gt; one of my helpers tries to upload a mess of files, it would
PR&gt; probably run forever. Especially on Win2000, which has a better
PR&gt; TCP stack than NT4. 

I've got another problem with Xitami, or at least: I think Xitami may
be causing some troubles. But maybe it's due to TCP stack troubles on
Win98, I don't know.

Let me explain my setup and when the problem occurs:

The server I'm running xitami on has two network-cards. Basicly the
setup is as follows:

Internet  --CableModem  ---- Server(NIC1)
                        ---- Server(NIC2) ----- LAN

So, the server has two NICs, one for the 'outside' and the other for
the Lan. The server runs Win98 and serves my homepage with Xitami.

People on the LAN can do anything they want on the internet because
the server is also running Sygate software.

Now  the  problem is that everytime someone on the LAN connects to the
homepage (either on the local or external ip-address), the
internet-connection is lost! After about 30 seconds, the
internet-connection to the outside is back again. Pretty strange
right?

Could this be due to:
a) The workings of Xitami?
b) The OS; Win98?
c) Sygate?
d) Something funny the ISP has done to the CableModem?

For the record: with 'External' I mean that via the LAN people connect
to the homepage on the NIC1 IP-address instead of NIC2.
(So, NIC2 having the local 192.168.0.1 address).

Any suggestions?

 Melle
