Thanks, that's perfect ... all I needed to know (now I'll go &amp; play)

Paul


Sure. I use  IA mail server (on same box as Xitami) ... www.tnsoft.com
I write an EXE that can accept command line parameters, explained in a moment.
When a mail comes into a specific 'robot' email account, the mail server writes
the email content to the hard drive and starts the EXE, providing as a parameter
the
path to the email file it just wrote.

After that, it's a matter of permissions and what you want to do with the email.
In this case, I have remote programs (clients) that via code ... send the email
to a specific email address.
My robots ... EXE's .. unencrypt the data and based on the structure of the
data, post the data to the
database and send confirmation emails .

Advantage 1 ... The server ( 166 mhz Cyrix) can access 250 messages in 15
seconds without barking.  The messages are cached and stored until the contents
are
executed.

Advantage 2 ... The data sits encrypted in the mail message. Even if hacked, the
contents are useless to intruders.

Advantage 3 ... The robots are run sequentially and can take their time.

Advantage 4 ... The robots can actually execute on another machine and 'poll'
for new messages. With this technique, I can build a transaction processing
system.

Works for me.  I use CGI, but not to post data. Only to read content from a
relational database and run the queries on the server.
