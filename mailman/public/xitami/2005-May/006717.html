<PRE>Hello All,

as I wanted to run the small utility provided by Marc here on the list I ran into some 
problems. Some are solved with the help of Marc, but one thing I am still wondering 
about and would like to get some input from the list.
What I found so far is that cgi is not running proper, if ever, on xitami 2.5c2. Too bad, 
had to switch the whole server to 2.4d11.
My problem which is left:
I can't get cgi running if xitami is started as a service with xisrv32 even when the user 
who starts the service is in the same user group as the user who starts the xigui32. 
Starting xitami with xigui32, cgi is running proper. Does anyone has any ideas why ?

I like to run xitami as a service while I don't have to log onto the machine 
( power outage...power back on = xitami back on).
Has anyone running xitami as a service with xigui32 and srvany ? Haven't tried it yet.

Johannes
