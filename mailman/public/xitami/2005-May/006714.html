<PRE>  Thanks Lois!  You hit the problem &quot;dead on the money&quot;!  Of course I would 
have never found it or figured it out on my own, I see now that you are 
exactly right about what is going on!  The problem is howeveri, I'm not sure 
that I will be able to fix it..  Since I renamed the &quot;template.html&quot; file 
that came with the script, and replaced it with cpsa.shtml, does this mean 
that I will now have to change every instance of &quot;template.html&quot; to 
&quot;cpsa.shtml&quot; within the script??  I sure hate being this close to making 
this thing work and not have the ability to make this final adjustment, but 
I hate bothering you or anyone else with my prob also..  Is there a simple 
method, or is there any kind of work-around so that I might be able to make 
the appropriate changes to this script without messing it all up?  Again I'm 
really sorry to bother anyone with this, but I aprreciate it a lot, and it's 
quite obvious to me that you know/knew exactly what's going on with it!  
Thanks a ton and have a good day all!   harthon

</I>&gt;<i>   Thanks Ron, &quot;AND Lois&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I have about decided that I am also having problems with the cgi script
</I>&gt;<i>itself, for the following reasons, unless someone here might recognize
</I>&gt;<i>something else I should do.
</I>&gt;<i>   I CAN make the opening page &quot;template file&quot; include the index.cgi file
</I>&gt;<i>which allows me to set that page up using html etc;  HOWEVER, the script
</I>&gt;<i>automatically builds additional pages as you go, (it's like a blog or bb
</I>&gt;<i>script), as well as it auto-prints page numbers &quot;on the fly&quot;  ie: [Page:
</I>&gt;<i>1.2.3...] into that page, BUT that first page is the ONLY page that seems 
</I>&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;<i>be using the &lt;include&gt;!!  IOWs when you click one of the additional page 
</I>&gt;<i>#s,
</I>&gt;<i>you are sent directly to the index.cgi instead of everything remaining
</I>&gt;<i>inside of the template page....  hope @ makes sense!!   So although I AM
</I>&gt;<i>able to link to the template.shtml page where it is working correctly, and
</I>&gt;<i>the index.cgi is included into the html design etc; once you click to go to
</I>&gt;<i>another page of the script, all of this is gone!   Sorry so long and
</I>&gt;<i>confusing, but I really do appreciate all of your help and consideration.
</I>&gt;<i>Have a good day!  harthon
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>=========
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think you should look within the script you are using and see if
</I>&gt;<i>there is a place where it is including a header or footer for the
</I>&gt;<i>pages other than the first page - which uses your template.   Or where
</I>&gt;<i>you can create a space to include what you are trying to include and
</I>&gt;<i>then use the 'sub include' I offered in my previous post to call it
</I>&gt;<i>within the script itself rather than just in the template.   I've done
</I>&gt;<i>this with other scripts.
