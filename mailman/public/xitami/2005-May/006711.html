<PRE>~It's been awhile since I've done any SSI, but I remember I had to call my
pages shtml or shtm.


I do know that for includes to work such as:  &lt;!--#include
virtual=&quot;sitefoot.txt&quot;--&gt; it is going to
look for the file you are including in the main web page directory of your
server (i.e.
/webpages) and it will not show if you place the file within a subdirectory
of /webpages where
you may have your template.html file.

If you want to include a .txt file within a scipt what I use is:

sub include {
# --------------------------------------------------------
# This is text to include. Use like an SSI.

my $file = shift;
open (FILE, &quot;&lt;$file&quot;) or die &quot;Can't open $file ($!)&quot;;
print &lt;FILE&gt;;
close FILE;
}
## Then add this line wherever you want file included:

 |;
&amp;include (&quot;dbside.txt&quot;);
print qq|

I use this for many scripts to include a footer and side menu within my
displays.   Especially
for hosts sites which don't always allow SSI.

Hope this help :)
