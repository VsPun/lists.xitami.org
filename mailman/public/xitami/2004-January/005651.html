<PRE>  Thanks for the help!  However, I did try this.  I started by first trying 
to make that entry into my defaults,  and THEN, I even went into the 
web-based setup and entered this info into the alias section there!!  I just 
pointed it to: D:\Xitami2    (just like that),  hoping to point to the 
second occurrence of Xitami that I have installed on my D:\ drive....  It 
still does not work..  A remote user who tries to access this, says that the 
link to this section is not even clickable!   Any other help or advice, or 
maybe showing me what I'm doing wrong, or exactly how to go about this, 
would be greatly appreciated! Thanks again, and have a good day!  Please 
help with this, as my C:\ drive is FULL!

i do it all the time. slapped in a 120gb second drive for storage.

defaults.cfg under the alias section

[Alias]
    /cam=d:/xitami/webpages/cam
