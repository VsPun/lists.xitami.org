<PRE>from the outside (internet), people are  going to 24.209.120.13 which is
your router. you need to allow them through the router to your pc that has
the web server.

i always use NAT for this. do a search and you'll find tons of info. if your
router supports nat it will be in the help documentation for your router.

basically you have to translate port 80 (www) from your outside address
(24.209.120.13) to your inside address (192.168.1.2).

Subject: [Xitami] web server w/ router (again)


Ive posted a couple of times now about trying to run the xitami web server
from my computer.  It's set up pn a broadband connection that is shared with
a Linksys router between two computers.  I set this computer (Windows XP)
to have a manual IP of 192.168.1.2  (the router's IP is 192.168.1.1) with
the subnet mask being set to 255.255.255.0, the default gateway as
192.168.1.1.  When I ran ipconfig/all I got 3 DNS numbers and put the first
two in as my primary and alternate DNS servers.  I then set the router up in
the advanced/DMZ HOST IP ADDRESS to be 192.168.1.2 and turned the Xitami web
server on.  When I enter <A HREF="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</A> into the browser it goes to the
router set-up, which is good.  When I try to access pages on the internet,
it works, which is good.  When I enter <A HREF="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</A> it loads the
index.html page I put in the Xitami server folder, which is great.  Here's
the problem, however... when I look up my IP address online (the one
assigned to me via my ISP) I get 24.209.120.13.  When I enter
<A HREF="http://24.209.120.13">http://24.209.120.13</A> into my browser, I get nothing, which is bad.  It seems
that I have everything set up right and straightened out, but I still cant
get access to the web site Im trying to host from this computer.  What am I
doing wrong, or what else can I do?
