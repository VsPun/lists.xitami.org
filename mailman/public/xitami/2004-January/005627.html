Okay - reposting -=20

Steven,

Except for OS differences, I already do what you want to do with a =
Linksys wireless cable router.  This is what you do.

First, determine the internal IP address for the network card that is =
attached to your router.  Each card or interface can actually have its =
own address (used or not).  Click &quot;Networks&quot; in the system tray  and =
choose &quot;ethernet&quot;.  In one of those tabs, it has your configurations =
settings (don't have an XP on me right now so shooting from memory).  =
Write down your IP address, the gateway, mask, and DNS addresses.  It is =
possible to use that IP in your router settings, but it is technically =
dynamic (changeable) so it would be wise to set it to a static address, =
but you can do it later.  You can also run &quot;IPCONFIG&quot; to get this info, =
as long as you choose the correct interface.

The reason I'm suggesting using your current IP address is just to get =
it running.  When you set your address manually, you must also set the =
gateway (your router), mask (that 255.255.x.x number), and the Domain =
Name lookup (DNS) addresses.  Since you set these up manually, no =
request is made to the DHCP server for this stuff.  Also, choose an =
address the mask likes.

Now, armed with your notes, go into your router's setup.  Usually you =
enter its IP (198.168.1.1) or whatever and password.  Choose the =
ADVANCED tab then &quot;DMZ Host&quot;.  Enter your server's IP address here and =
apply it.

Your server is now open to the world - completely open.  As if it were =
the only computer connected to the modem.  The DMZ Host will direct ALL =
traffic to this machine so a firewall is REALLY important!  All your =
peer sharing stuff should also work now for the same reason.

Test that it works before setting up a manual IP address, remembering to =
include the the gateway, mask and DNS host addresses in the server's =
settings.  You will need to change the DMZ address before it works =
again.  Rebooting may also help.

You could have setup Port Forwarding to forward a range of ports to this =
server, but why.  Port Forwarding will be useful if you have different =
computer perform different tasks.  Mail here, DB there, FTP to that one, =
etc...  Then you need to know who does what to which port.  Right now =
its a simple application with a simple solution, mostly.

Much luck,
Charles

  Sorry for the repost guys...  I lost he responses I got back to this =
query, and I was hoping that those of you that replied (or anyone with =
the messages) would please re-send the messages.  There were 2 in =
particular that offered me a lot of specific help in my quest to get =
this web server &amp; other applications working.  I know they would've been =
enough to get at least Xitami working, and Im frustrated that I lost it.

  Thanks again,
  Steve
