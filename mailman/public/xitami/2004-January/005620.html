Steven,

Except for OS differences, I already do what you want to do with a =
Linksys wireless cable router.  This is what you do.

First, determine the internal IP address for the network card that is =
attached to your router.  Each card or interface can actually have its =
own address (used or not).  Click &quot;Networks&quot; in the system tray  and =
choose &quot;ethernet&quot;.  In one of those tabs, it has your configurations =
settings (don't have an XP on me right now so shooting from memory).  =
Write down your IP address, the gateway, mask, and DNS addresses.  It is =
possible to use that IP in your router settings, but it is technically =
dynamic (changeable) so it would be wise to set it to a static address, =
but you can do it later.  You can also run &quot;IPCONFIG&quot; to get this info, =
as long as you choose the correct interface.

The reason I'm suggesting using your current IP address is just to get =
it running.  When you set your address manually, you must also set the =
gateway (your router), mask (that 255.255.x.x number), and the Domain =
Name lookup (DNS) addresses.  Since you set these up manually, no =
request is made to the DHCP server for this stuff.  Also, choose an =
address the mask likes.

Now, armed with your notes, go into your router's setup.  Usually you =
enter its IP (198.168.1.1) or whatever and password.  Choose the =
ADVANCED tab then &quot;DMZ Host&quot;.  Enter your server's IP address here and =
apply it.

Your server is now open to the world - completely open.  As if it were =
the only computer connected to the modem.  The DMZ Host will direct ALL =
traffic to this machine so a firewall is REALLY important!  All your =
peer sharing stuff should also work now for the same reason.

Test that it works before setting up a manual IP address, remembering to =
include the the gateway, mask and DNS host addresses in the server's =
settings.  You will need to change the DMZ address before it works =
again.  Rebooting may also help.

You could have setup Port Forwarding to forward a range of ports to this =
server, but why.  Port Forwarding will be useful if you have different =
computer perform different tasks.  Mail here, DB there, FTP to that one, =
etc...  Then you need to know who does what to which port.  Right now =
its a simple application with a simple solution, mostly.

Happy Multitasking,
Charles

  Subject: [Xitami] Running server through a router


  I am trying to run the Xitami web server on my WIndows XP machine that =
is connected to the internet via a cable modem (RoadRunner/Motorola =
Surboard).  The internet connection is split amongst 2 computers using a =
Linksys router.  When I start the web server everything seems fine, but =
when I try to access the web page I have loaded on the server by =
connecting to my internet connection's (cable modem) IP address, I am =
directed to the router's configuration page.  This also happens when the =
server is turned off, so it's not a big suprise.  What is odd is that =
when I try to connect to the router's config page by entering the =
router's default IP address into IE, I am not taken to the config page =
as usual, but I'm instead directed to the web page I have installed on =
the Xitami web server.  When the web server is turned off I go straight =
to the config page as expected.  It seems like somehow the router's IP =
is bouncing me back from the router to the computer with the server =
installed, and the cable modem's (internet connection) IP is forwarding =
straight to the router and never reaching the computer with the server =
installed.  I assume this is a relatively simple fix for any of you that =
are knowledgeable with networks, but I can't figure out what to do to =
fix this &amp; make it work with my set up.  I also cant run the server and =
a file sharing program like KazaA or WinMX.  Is there a way to allow for =
these programs and the server to all run together harmoniously?  Thanks =
in advance for any help, and I apologize if this question has already =
been beaten to death.

  Steve
