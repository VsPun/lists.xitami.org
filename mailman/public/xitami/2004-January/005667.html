Okay, the router does it. Now, I still don't see why he would want to =
access the web server on HIS lan by using the external IP. As he said he =
is able to access by the local IP, and as I said, and one other if I'm =
not wrong, am able to access the site using the external IP, what would =
be the reason for accessing it from the lan using the external IP??? It =
seems all forwarding is being done and the site IS up and running =
properly.

  Chestnut,

  Entering your external IP WILL access your web site, even when typed =
at the server (just tested it).  Your access.log file will show your =
gateway address (in Steve's case 192.168.1.1) instead of the usual =
external access IP.  Sometimes, in my instance anyway, you have to enter =
the &quot;<A HREF="http://"">http://&quot;</A> along with the IP.  But ... if virtual hosting is active =
and there's nothing at base host, then you get nothing.

  I don't understand why it doesn't work the same as my operation.  For =
the sake of comparison:

  Router is a Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless 4-port (first version, nearly 2 =
years old)
  Router's address is changed to 10.168.1.1 and is also the gateway
  Subnet mask is 255.255.248.0 (I don't know why)
  DHCP services are on with addresses starting at 10.168.1.100
  DMZ Host is set to 10.168.1.50 (notice outside DHCP territory but =
shouldn't matter)
      (*I have tried Port Forward and that works slick too!)

  Computer is a hand-me-down P166 that I just upped the mem to 256MB; =
3.25GB HD.
  Running a Xitami 2.5c1 console (xidos.exe) in a DOS windows on Windows =
98SE (does service work?)
  HTTP port is changed to 1975 and FTP is disabled
  Virtual Host is active (and actually working) but base host is blank.
  Server is manually configure to 10.168.1.50
  Gateway is entered as 10.168.1.1 along with subnet mask 255.255.255.0
  DNS IPs are also entered manually and can be found on the router's =
Status page
  Other servers installed: Fictional Daemon (FTP and Telnet) and Mercury =
Mail
  Also on board: MySQL and PHP

  I think that's all.  Hope this is useful.

    Steve, do you mean that you enter 24.209.120.13 when within your own =
network, if so that will not work, need to be on the outside, another =
computer accessing from somewhere other than your own place. The setup =
appears to be fine. I accessed your site at 24... and it loads fine. =
Even went to the link on The ORIGINAL DARWIN... and it loads, went to =
one of the links from there, fine. It appears to me that your setup is =
working as you want it to. I would say you are doing nothing wrong.

      Subject: [Xitami] web server w/ router (again)


      Ive posted a couple of times now about trying to run the xitami =
web server from my computer.  It's set up pn a broadband connection that =
is shared with a Linksys router between two computers.  I set this =
computer (Windows XP)  to have a manual IP of 192.168.1.2  (the router's =
IP is 192.168.1.1) with the subnet mask being set to 255.255.255.0, the =
default gateway as 192.168.1.1.  When I ran ipconfig/all I got 3 DNS =
numbers and put the first two in as my primary and alternate DNS =
servers.  I then set the router up in the advanced/DMZ HOST IP ADDRESS =
to be 192.168.1.2 and turned the Xitami web server on.  When I enter =
<A HREF="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</A> into the browser it goes to the router set-up, which =
is good.  When I try to access pages on the internet, it works, which is =
good.  When I enter <A HREF="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</A> it loads the index.html page I =
put in the Xitami server folder, which is great.  Here's the problem, =
however... when I look up my IP address online (the one assigned to me =
via my ISP) I get 24.209.120.13.  When I enter <A HREF="http://24.209.120.13">http://24.209.120.13</A> into =
my browser, I get nothing, which is bad.  It seems that I have =
everything set up right and straightened out, but I still cant get =
access to the web site Im trying to host from this computer.  What am I =
doing wrong, or what else can I do?
