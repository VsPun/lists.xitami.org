Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and DDNS
Message-ID: <4941C974.9050700@googlemaill.com>

Hi All,

I'm back to running Xitami again and I'm having problems logging into my
DDNS service DynDns. I've tried playing with the ddnsdef.xml file based
on the manual login:

http://magus1011:password at members.dyndns.org/nic/update?hostname=brewhau.dyndns.tv&myip=999.999.999.999&wildcard=NOCHG

to no good effect. Of course my password isn't password nor is my IP
999.999.999.999 but other than that this works to get me either a "good
<my real IP>" or a "nochg <my real IP>" response in a browser. Does
anyone have a clue what I should have in the ddnsdef.xml file to get the
same response from Xitami?

Curious, how are you running DynDNS with Xitami - or at least how were you 
running it previously?  Was it for virtual domains or for a single domain? 
Is it an actual setting in Xiami config file?

I use DynDNS for my home system (w/o Xitami), but its a simple client thats 
on the actual PC (that you could also run on the webserver) that updates 
DynDNS with my real IP.  Certain home routers have an option built into it 
to use one of serveral dynamic dns providers but I am choosing to use the PC 
client instead.

No, my name is Magus, not Curious. 8=))

Well, there's a ddnsdef.xml file in the app folder. The definitions for
various Dynamic DNS services are in there. It takes some tweaking but
I'm about one millimetre from having it working with DynDns. I've
learned a lot watching the wire with WireShark about how this file works
with DynDns. It's for a single domain right now.

I have such a program also, but I thik the less I have running in my
system tray the better which is why I'm getting this working with
Xitami. Some programs also have it built in. One example would be HFS or
HTTP Files System. Of course if you want to do it manually, just play
with the manual logon I gave below, changing whatever is appropriate
the dyndns user name and password, the hostname and IP, in your instance.

will work. Thanks to the good people at WireShark for an excellent

I have been running dyndns with Xitami for over 9 Years, it is such a 
easy setup, consider these points

Aquire the server IP on DynDNS, select wildcards if you want them and 
you are done, make sure you have a port forward if you are using a 
router and forward to port 80

Takes all of 22 seconds

Well, thats my point.  I was originally asking if there was some special 
Xitami DynDNS setup because otherwise its really shouldn't have anything to 
do with Xitami.  DynDNS would be a server/pc thing, not Xitami specific. 
Point DynDNS domain (ie: gotdns.com) to your PC/Servers IP, and you are 
done.

Perhaps it does, perhaps it doesn't, explain Windows. Flaming someone
else's choice of Operating System is just asking to start a flame war,
something I consider a pointless waste of my time.

I not certain what it is you are talking about taking "all of 22
seconds". Are you using your browser to log in to DynDNS and then do
your steps? I've been using DynDNS Updater in my system tray to
accomplish the same thing for many, many years, I think Xitami was at
0.9 something when I first started. I've now made running DynDNS Updater
obsolete.

What I'm talking about is using the Xitami Administration page,
Configuration and then the DDNS Setup page to set this up so that when
Xitami starts it automatically sets my address on DynDNS for me. Perhaps
it is the "hard way" to get things working right, but I strongly doubt
that it's the "hard way" when I  reduce your 22 seconds to 0 seconds.

Yes, there is a Xitami specific setup for DDNS. You will find it in the
Administration, then Configuration then DDNS section of the
Administrators screens. When it's setup correctly, you do absolutely
nothing to have Xitami set your IP with DynDNS. Don't forget to check
the "Enable dynamic DNS sign-on?" check-box and fill out the rest of the
page correctly. It then becomes an "It's set so I can forget it" matter.

Heh...in all the years I have used Xitami I never recall seeing that 
feature.  In fact, I am looking now and don't see it anywhere in the Admin 
user web interface.  What version of Xitami are you using?  I am using 
v2.4d9

Well, the source to Xitami 2.5c2 is at
http://www.xitami.com/download.htm. Help yourself. You'll need a Windows
98se Virtual Machine and a copy of VS 6 and a few other simple tools for
the Windows version. There's also a copy of 2.4d11 there as well. Find a
bug, fix it and publish the fix.
