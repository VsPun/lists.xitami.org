<PRE>I have a minor problem with Xitami 2.5c2

I run a server with currently 8 domains on Windows XP Pro using this server 
and lately I've been noticing a few odd behaviours.

1) When connecting to the FTP server part, from Windows Explorer on a 
machine located on my own network, or neighboring IP address, the Xitami 
server crashes with an error in C++. No further explanation but the 
connection times out and then the server dies. There is hardly any load at 
all on the server at these times and when I connect from my linux box it 
works just fine and super fast. It only happens when I connect from a 
windows machine.

2) The same thing seems to happen a lot when I have 4 or more connections 
at the same time to one of the domains. It is not at all a heavy load but 
suddenly it just dies.
     This is not to hard on the system, however what is more annoying than 
anything is the fact that I click the RESTART button on the display popup 
telling me the system crashed, and it doesn't restart. It just dies and 
remains closed until I manually dig up the short cut to the Xitami GUI and 
click that.

This means if I want this to be running permanently, I have to sit and 
watch the server all the time instead of relying on any auto start or 
restart options actually working.
Is there a fix for this?

Thanks for a continued great service and an excellent server app. otherwise.
