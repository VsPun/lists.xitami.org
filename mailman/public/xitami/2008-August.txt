Subject: [Xitami] CGI header access?
Message-ID: <LMBBINNEFDDGLLBPAFJDMEEJPIAA.wilson@wha.com>

I've been using Xitami since 2000 and am reluctant to change web servers
'cause everything has worked perfectly.

I have a CGI exe as my default "page" which builds dynamic pages for me,
HTML only no HTTP headers.

I want to make a change in that for some domains I want that same CGI to
issue a 3-line redirection - just issue HTTP headers and no HTML (bringing
it back to the same server but with a different name and it has to be a 301
Redirection):

Writeln('HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently');
Writeln('Location: http://NewDomain.com/page1.htm');
Writeln('');

Question(s):  Can I simply put this code in the same default CGI?  Do CGIs
handle headers?  If not, is there another way to issue a redirection? A
redirection under program control?

Thanks.

Quick answer: YES

in fact I tested it and so long as you have not printed ANYTHING
before the redirect it will work. i.e. starting your CGI function with
code similar to
if (domain == "thisdomain.com") {
print "Status: 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://otherdomain.com/\n\n";
exit;
}
works just fine

Thank you.
I love those "quick answers", especially when they're "YES"
It saves so much time to ask before delving into the unknown.

Hello,

I am new here and have very little clue what I am doing. I am basically just trying to get PHP to work on my home computer. I tried unsuccessfully to download apache. Having no other places to turn to, I found xitami. I followed the instruction in the FAQ to install php and they worked, sort of. The code printed out fine in DOS but still wouldn't function in a regular browser window. All the php tags were completely ignored.

Please, I have no idea what I'm doing here. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance.

Donna,
 
You should have a php.ini in your php folder.
Did you copy "php.ini-recomended" to "php.ini" ?
 
In xitami add this line in xitami.cfg or defaults.cfg under the
[Filters] section
For php 5:
    .php = "C:\\php\\php-cgi.exe"
for php 4:
    .php = "C:\\php\\php.exe"    

You must set this in php.ini to get output back through the server to
the browser:
cgi.force_redirect = 0

make this file and try to access it though a browser:
Quick test file:
<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Look at cgierr.log in c:\xitami for errors.
 
That should give you some stuff to get going,
Brian

MessageFrom a command prompt have you verify the php script works properly?

When installing PHP there is an option to select which webserver you are installing for and it lists Xitami - make certain you select that.  But what Brian stated below should be sufficient to get things working.

The problem is common.
You must change the default page section as well.

the proper config is as follows

Skip all they say about PHP-CGI

Use this to make it work..

In defaults.cfg  add the following...

[Filter]
#   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
.php="c:/php/php.exe"

[Mime]
    php=application/x-httpd-php


Change your default index settings as follows...

    default1=index.php
    default2=default.php
    default3=index.htm
    default4=default.htm
    default5=index.html
    default6=default.html
    default7=404.htm


In default setup of PHP 5 on Windows you should be aware of the following.

a)    $_POST[$VarName] WILL NOT WORK
       $_SESSION[$xVar]  WILL NOT WORK

they are turned off by default and should be so as well since they pose 
security risks.

b) The workaround for this is included below

(?2008 to myself)

Someone in here said it does work out of the box. but surely did not on 
my machine.
I ran the std installer of PHP 5 and use Xitami 2.5 for dev purposes only.

there is a slight error in the solution script you have to change the 
function name in the calling sample, thats all.

It may work for some, for others not.
I know my version of the REQUEST_EX will work both on apache and xitami 
in the same manner.

Good luck.

Hello,

We recently ran a training session in New Mexico for PHP and MySQL programming. We used Xitami as a webserver. We put up a guided tutorial on how to install the combination XP / Xitami / PHP and MySQL that may be useful for other people, as well. The site is available at:

http://lab.bcb.iastate.edu/training/webdev/nmsu/prereq.htm

Feel free to link to this resource from your own pages,

HTH,

It looks great!

There is a Xitami wiki at http://xitami.wikidot.com/, you can register
and add a link to your tutorial if you want.
