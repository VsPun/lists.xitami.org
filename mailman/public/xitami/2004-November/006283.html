<PRE>Thanks for the help! 

I'm not sure how he did it or why, but he deleted his ftproot directory along with a few others. Unfortunately he's 2,000 miles
away so it took all day to figure it out. Just when I had given up
the statement, &quot;could this have anything to do with it?&quot; appeared on
my screen. Ahhhh, shoot me.

So now the connection issue is solved. Somewhere along the way his NAT config must of went sour though. I can connect to Xitami without any issues. I get the normal welcome screen, 
but as soon as Xitami switches the data connection port to 200 it 
hangs. I'm assuming we need to create a pinhole through his router
to open 200. I'm curious to know why it worked fine for two weeks 
with the current config, but now all of sudden it's blocked.

Anyway, thanks again for the help! It's really appreciated!

</I>&gt;<i> I would recommend your friend dumps the XP firewall and installs Zonealarm 
</I>&gt;<i> instead.
</I>&gt;<i> Zonealarm claims it's not made for servers but in fact it works just fine.
</I>&gt;<i> It is on top of that a build of outpost for linux somehow as it reports 
</I>&gt;<i> itself to be the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, for the configuration, go into Advanced and allow odd servers to run 
</I>&gt;<i> under high security,
</I>&gt;<i> and then specify that port 80 and other standard access rights are ok. Then 
</I>&gt;<i> you should be set.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> XP's firewall has little to no ability to specify any distinct settings and 
</I>&gt;<i> if it's only SP 1 then it's pretty much not worth anything anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> I had a few guys compare security on firewalls and it took them about 10 
</I>&gt;<i> minutes to get through all standard Windows firewalls but a NAT is 
</I>&gt;<i> something different.
</I>&gt;<i> It can be broken but will take them 4 - 6 hours and is so much easier to 
</I>&gt;<i> detect.
