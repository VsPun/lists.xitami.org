<PRE>Hello Adam,

I haven't done that, but I would try to edit the default.cfg directly. Here the section out of the 
xitami.cfg.

#   Specifies the HTTP throttle pipe. With a throttle pipe you can
#   restrict the throughput of a website to some fixed maximum, e.g.
#   64Kbps. This can be useful if several websites share a single
#   line, and you need to share this on a quality-of-service basis.
#   The HTTP throttle pipe is applied to all download and upload
#   requests to the website. You can apply a throttle pipe to the
#   entire HTTP server or to specific virtual hosts. Pipes are defined
#   in the XML file 'pipedef.xml'. You can edit this file to add new
#   pipes; Xitami reloads this automatically after a short delay. Each
#   pipe is defined as several 'instances', which are simply
#   individual pipes that share the same characteristics. For example,
#   the default pipedef.xml file defines several pipes with a 64Kbps
#   throughput. These are individual instances of a 64Kpbs pipe. All
#   transfers that use a specific pipe instance share the bandwidth of
#   that pipe instance.

    pipe=

#   Specifies the throttle pipe definition file. This is an XML file
#   that follows a specific format - look at pipedef.xml for an
#   explanation. If you define your own throttle pipes, it's a good
#   idea to copy pipedef.xml to something else (e.g. 'mypipes.xml')
#   and then change that. This avoids unpleasant surprises when you
#   upgrade your Xitami version. Note that we may change the format of
#   the pipe definition file in the future.

    pipedef=pipedef.xml

If you want to make changes to that, make them in your default.cfg. After editing and the saving 
the default.cfg the changes should take affect. I experienced similar problems when working with 
the &quot;admin gui&quot; and just edited the file and the settings did take effect.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've read through the FAQ and help, but I can't figure out how to make use 
</I>&gt;<i> of the Pipe settings to limit bandwidth.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to limit the bandwidth so I can see how my project will run over 
</I>&gt;<i> various connections.  When I try to select an HTTP throttle pipe from the 
</I>&gt;<i> configuration screen it never saves my selection.  Ideally I would like to 
</I>&gt;<i> limit it even further then 32k.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not worried about segmenting the bandwidth among sites,  a global 
</I>&gt;<i> setting will work fine for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine this is pretty simple to do, once you know the right steps to 
</I>&gt;<i> take. If anyone could provide me those steps I would really appreciate it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am on an XP machine.  Running Xitami 2.5c2
