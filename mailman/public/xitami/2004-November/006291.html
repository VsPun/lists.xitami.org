<PRE>I've tried a very short php file and id dosn't seem to make a difference on
the size. I do have sites that get quite a bit of traffic especially when
the spiders hit it. No I don't know C/C++ so I will just do a batch file
activated by WinCron for now. But I think this is something that should be
addressed by someone who can fix Xitami. Since each pipexxxx.flt is between
15 and 30kb I now understand why I kept seeing my drive fill up considering
in the time it took me to write this it used 1mb of drive space.

&gt;<i>Good info, now how do I fix it?
</I>
It really depends on your setup.  It sounds like you might have a really
complex setup, so it might help to try something simple first like a simple
PHP page that does nothing but spit back an '&lt;? echo &quot;hi\n&quot;; ?&gt;' to the
client.  The next thing I would do is take the server off the Internet for
a minute or two to try the same tests locally to rule out a bunch of people
just requesting pages.  If you have a really high-volume site that can't go
down, that's probably your problem and you can't do much about it unless
you want to learn C/C++ and edit the source code.  I'm pretty sure Xitami
will simply overwrite the FLT files when it loops back around to
pipe0000.flt.  If you want, you can always set up some script that
regularly goes through the directory and cleans out the FLT files.
NT-based OSes will stop the process when you hit a file in use.

&gt;<i>It is leaving every page visited in the pipexxxx.flt temp file on the
</I>&gt;<i>server. Is this a problem with Xitami or PHP?
</I>
This is likely a Xitami issue except for if you have long-running PHP
processes (30 seconds or more).  If PHP did this, you would hear everyone
hollering about it on Slashdot.

One question that just popped into my head:  Did you accidentally turn on
the &quot;log CGI page requests&quot; option in the configuration?  I seem to recall
that the option keeps around the FLT files in that case and seems to be
what you are describing.
