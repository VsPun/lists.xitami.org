</I>&gt;<i>I'm puzzled by whats happening to my copy of Xitami. It seems to run 
</I>&gt;<i>fine for a few hours, then whilst I'm asleep it suspends itself. When I 
</I>&gt;<i>wake up in the morning, click ok on the 'Xitami Suspended' box, it 
</I>&gt;<i>crashes.
</I>
I've noticed that one of my copies of Xitami 2.5 seems to get somewhat
upset by various worms poking around.  I've not had a chance to track it
down, but there may be a bug that is being tickled causing it to crash.
(Since the worms are targeting IIS it shouldn't be getting into your
machine that way, but all sorts of machines have been upset by all this
probing, including apparently some printers!)

Xitami 2.4d9 should be more stable, if stablity is your concern.

&gt;<i>I did manage to (no idea how) install version 2.5b5 - I unstalled it, 
</I>&gt;<i>and reinstalled 2.4d9, but some parts (it seems the icon on the Control 
</I>&gt;<i>Panel has stayed) remain. Is there a sure-fire way I can get rid of all 
</I>&gt;<i>Xitami, then reinstall it ?
</I>
I'd suggest installing the version you want in another directory, and then
copying all your configuration, web pages, etc, etc, over to the new
directory.  When you're happy everything is working in the new
directory, you can just delete the old directory.  (If you're using the
NT Service version you should deregister the service before you delete
the directory to avoid some errors being reported on bootup.)
