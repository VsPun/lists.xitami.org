<PRE>&gt;<i> This is fixed in our version in CVS
</I>&gt;<i> (see <A HREF="http://cvs.imatix.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs/">http://cvs.imatix.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> but not in any of the binaries that have been built.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this has also been reported, and I think it may have been fixed
</I>&gt;<i> in the version in CVS.
</I>
Are you going to build a v 2.5b6 in the near future? From the 
Knownbug.txt in the CVS system it seems like quite a lot of fixes have 
been submitted that need to be rolled up and released.

I will be happy to part of the test team, if required, and even if 
pressed part of the code-team - but I have to admit to limited recent C 
coding experience - but either way I'd like to get a version that fixes 
most known bugs
