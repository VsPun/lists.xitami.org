<PRE>&gt;<i> The cart program asks for two main items of information - the &quot;document root&quot; which is simply the path to where it lives - c:\xitami\cgi-bin\cart.cgi - and the &quot;domain name&quot; - which, is where on a unix server at my ISP would be something like www.smart-choices.org (which really does exist, and where the cart programs are located), but I'm not sure what that value needs to be on my local system. 
</I>
&quot;domain name&quot; of &quot;localhost&quot; should work. Same as you should be using to
open the web pages that call your scripts. 

If you prefer to see a &quot;normal looking&quot; URL like &quot;snoo.com&quot; in your
scripts, edit your &quot;hosts&quot; file like this: 

 127.0.0.1       localhost
 127.0.0.1       ads.x10.com  #damn spam
 127.0.0.1       snoo.com     # for testing cart program

(Some Windows distributions come with no &quot;hosts&quot;, just &quot;hosts.sam&quot;. Copy
it to the right name, re-start your browser or maybe Windows.) 

The first line is why &quot;localhost&quot; resolves to &quot;this machine&quot;, and is
normally preset in &quot;hosts&quot;. (The second line is my trick to foil a
specific pop-up ad server-- ignore it.) The third line say that all
calls to &quot;snoo.com&quot; should go to the local machine. 

If there is a real &quot;snoo.com&quot; (or whatever test-name you use), this will
of course prevent you from reaching them. You could in fact use your
real name &quot;127.0.0.1 www.smart-choices.org&quot; for testing from your local
machine, and comment it out (leading &quot;#&quot;) when you want to test from the
real machine. Changes in &quot;hosts&quot; -may- work immediately, or with full
browser re-start. In the past, on WinNT4, I could keep hosts open,
change things, and see results in Netscape instantly. 

One issue: some versions of Windows will insist on connecting to an
external DNS server even to resolve names set locally in the &quot;hosts&quot;
file. If you are on-line, not a problem, but if you work on a laptop at
the beach it can be frustrating when it tries to dial-out just to &quot;find
itself&quot;. 

Disclaimer: MicroSoft never understood TCP/IP or DNS well, so your
results may vary depending on Windows version, service pack, browser
version, and moon-phase.
