No; those are all SLASHES.  It is the '\' character that is the
backslash.  Don't worry; yours is a very common error in nomenclature
made by those with overexposure to Windoze.  (I'm not quite certain why
this should be; I suspect that the over-use of the backslash as a path
separator has led to many people misnaming it, thus requiring a further
misnaming when referring to the forward slash.)  Of course, you could
always refer to is as a &quot;solidus&quot;, which is the official designation in
the national and international character set standards.

I would guess that your problem stems from the fact that NT doesn't know
how to perform wildcard expansion: this is a [non-]feature of the
operating system, and not something that an application, such as an FTP
daemon, can/should be expected to do.

I expect that your Sun performs this by the simple expedient of passing
the LIST command through to activate the standard 'ls -l' program, and
then piping the results back.  This will apply the level of wildcard
expansion that this program knows of.

Your basic problem is that the original FTP client application is
generating these wild-carded requests: is this something that it's
thought of itself?  Or could you write the requests as a series of
scripted operations (perhaps returning a full directory at the current
level, and then working through its constituent sub-directories)?
[That's the approach that I would use with the RxFTP facility if I needed
to script such an FTP client-side operation.]

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
