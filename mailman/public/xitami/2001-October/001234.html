<PRE>BRIAN HAMILTON KELLY WRITES:

Please find whatever mailer setting is doing this and STOP it; we don't
need to see everything you write (and worse, everything everyone before
you has written, and that you're quoting, without trimming) in duplicate,
once as plain ASCII text, and once as HTML.  The latter should only ever
be sent when the recipient has given permission for you to over-inflate
the length of your messages; NEVER dual-post to a mailing list like this!

&gt;<i> What about the &quot;InstantASP&quot; that Xitami touts as their ASP solution.
</I>Other
&gt;<i> than the bruising $1,000 price tag, does it work????
</I>
THAT WAS A TWO LINE MESSAGE!!!!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH WHAT WAS WRITTEN ABOVE??

IT WAS SENT ONLY ONCE, AND THE MESSAGE I SENT TO WAS ACTUALLY SHORTER THAN
YOUR RESPONSE......EVEN WITH THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE INCLUDED.  WHAT DID I
&quot;OVER-INFLATE&quot;???

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A DUAL POST??? THIS WAS SENT ONCE AND ONLY
ONCE???
