<PRE>&gt;<i>  is Xitami hack-proof?
</I>
Nothing is hack-proof. 

Let's look at what a hacker can do:

 1) crash your server. Most complex software has some combination of
unexpected input that will confuse it to death. Older versions of Xitami
on DOS/Win would lock-up if you request the file &quot;/LPT1&quot;... it waits
forever for the printer to supply data. But there are ways to make your
server inaccessible no matter what software it runs; ping-floods are a
popular trick.

 2) read your secret data. A good webserver on a good O/S has a very
clear policy about what files may or may not be served. I have not heard
of any Xitami hacks like this, and only one minor Apache hack. IIS seems
to have a big loophole in how it parses invalid meta-characters and a
carefully designed URL can read anything on an unpatched IIS machine. 

 3) infect your server. Install the hacker's code to run on your
machine, either to aid in an attack on another machine or to give the
hacker access to your secret files. It isn't that easy to make a
computer run arbitrary code. The easiest way is to find a telnet login
with no password and ample permissions. Another way is to hit a
protected login with a VERY long username or password that overflows the
login code and inserts malicious code where it will be run; this
requires specific knowledge of the binary code behind the login. CodeRed
exploits something like that in how IIS handles URL query-strings. 

Note that a specific attack on the &quot;wrong&quot; machine may have unintended
side-effects. CodeRed does not infect H-P printers, but a CodeRed attack
can cause the printer to lock-up and need a re-boot. 

However, Xitami is well designed (simple direct code), and is too
uncommon to attract hacker's direct interest. The only side-effect of
CodeRed attacks is bloated log files. I'd rather watch my logs grow than
suffer the pains of IIS operators. 

Most hacks have to target specific flaws in the server-- the hacker has
to know the insides of the code or behavior. For best effect, hackers
study the most-used servers: Apache and IIS. Apache is fairly clean and
has a large support community capable of quick patches. IIS is a mess
and it takes MS a long time to even admit there is a problem. (There are
a few other big servers popular for e-Commerce, like iPlanet, and these
are targeted by hackers to gain money-info.)

We don't know how many vulnerabilities exist in Xitami. But Xitami has
NO code in common with the hacker-favorites, Apache and IIS, so attacks
that work on the big servers are not liable to infect Xitami. Even if a
CodeRed-type worm were possible on Xitami, it would have a fairly hard
time finding another Xitami server to infect. 

 &quot;GET /msadc/..%255c..
 &quot;GET /scripts/..%c1%1c../

Someone is trying to exploit IIS's directories and flaws. They are too
dumb to notice that yours is not a IIS server. (These attacks are
automated; it is quicker to poke blindly than to check to see if the
target is the right brand.)

-OR-... your network administrator is testing to see if any machines on
her subnets are potential targets of a CodeRed-type attack. My
university has been &quot;hack-testing&quot; every machine here and referring any
vulnerabilities found to the responsible person. They found an old
version of WU-FTP, one that I know can be over-flowed and subverted, on
one of &quot;my&quot; boxes. Someone else actually manages that machine, so I was
glad that my net-bosses told me of his sin.
