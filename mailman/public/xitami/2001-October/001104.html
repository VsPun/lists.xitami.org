Ah.  I think I know what's going on -- there was a bug in Xitami where
if it failed to open a directory it would still try to call close_dir(),
which would then get very upset because it didn't have a valid directory
handle.

I think this problem is fixed in the version in CVS, as I seem to recall
a bug like this was reported a while ago.

If you want to fix it yourself and rebuild the binary have a look in
smtftpl.c (for ftpc_make_listing()), and change the logic for
opening/closing the directory around so that it only tries to close it
if the open was successful.

&gt;<i>Incidentally, an OS/2 port of GCC v3.0 has just been released and is 
</I>&gt;<i>available here:-
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="ftp://unixos2.org/incoming/gcc-os2-3.0-gcc.zip">ftp://unixos2.org/incoming/gcc-os2-3.0-gcc.zip</A>
</I>
Interesting.

&gt;<i>I'd be interested in which tools you use for building Xitami on OS/2 as
</I>&gt;<i>I'm hoping to put together an updated set as part of the UnixOS/2 project.
</I>
Xitami for OS/2 was built using the EMX compiler suite, plus REXX.  Otto
will generate REXX build scripts (but pre-built versions of these should
already be in the source kits), and Libero is used for generating some
of the other code (again, pre-built versions are in the source kits).
