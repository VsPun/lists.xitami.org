Yes: as was remarked only yesterday, MICROS~1 haven't the foggiest idea
about TCP/IP, and especially not about the niceties of the hosts file vs.
DNS.  Consequently, their so-called operating systems (even the fancy
shiny new ones like XP) do the wrong thing; even when you do your utmost
to assist them in doing &quot;the right thing&quot;, they second-guess you and
assume that &quot;you know nothing: THIS is the way it's done&quot;.

Using OS/2, I could handle your situation by setting the environment
variable USEHOSTSFIRST; however, because I have to suffer the
co-existence of various Windoze boxen on my home LAN, I now run a full
caching nameserver on my OS/2 server, which can satisfy this sort of
request from the Windoze machines.  When it really DOES need details of a
domain that is not in its local database or cache, then, and only then,
does it call my ISP's nameservers (because the boot.db file contains the
relevant forwarders line).

Now Win2K comes complete with a pretend implementation of a DNS server
(you're probably better off forcing it NOT to run &quot;from data in the
registry&quot;, when the full expertise of &quot;DNS &amp; BIND&quot; can be applied
verbatim) which could probably achieve your goal: however, I think you'd
find better advice on this on a newsgroup or mailing list related to
running DNS under Windows.

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
