Then you ought to know better than to dual-post: your message appeared in
both ASCII and also as HTML (the latter is NOT wanted on mailing lists).

&gt;<i>                                                 I have also used the FTP =
</I>&gt;<i> portion of Xitami for years.  I know that there are many of you who =
</I>&gt;<i> would tell me not to use the FTP portion of Xitami as I see people told =
</I>&gt;<i> that all the time.  I have been using it for years without issue under =
</I>&gt;<i> 98, ME, XP, and Mandrake Linux.  I have received 2 .rar (WinRAR) files =
</I>&gt;<i> from a client.  Usually, I get .rar files fine, but both of these are =
</I>&gt;<i> over 500 Meg.  I have never tried to receive files of this size over =
</I>&gt;<i> xitami before.
</I>
OK, you're saying (I think) that your client pushes the file to your
server, using an FTP client of some sort at his end, and using the PUT
command to transfer the file to your local storage, via the services of
the FTP server that's part of Xitami.  Is this correct?

&gt;<i> Both files are fine on his side, but on mine (the Xitami side), the file =
</I>&gt;<i> headers are corrupt, and cannot be repaired by any program including =
</I>&gt;<i> RAR, WinRAR, AZR, etc that I can find.  In fact, it is corrupted so bad =
</I>&gt;<i> that all programs say &quot;no files found&quot;.  So, it seems that I have 2 =
</I>&gt;<i> files each consisting of over 500 Meg of non-translatable garbage.
</I>
Did your client remember to tell his FTP client program to perform the
transfer in BINARY mode?   A stupid little error, I know, and one that no
experienced user of FTP ought to make, but...

-- 
   fix (vb.): 1. to paper over, obscure, hide from public view; 2. to
   work around, in a way that produces unintended consequences that are
   worse than the original problem.  Usage: &quot;Windows ME fixes many of the
   shortcomings of Windows 98 SE&quot;.
