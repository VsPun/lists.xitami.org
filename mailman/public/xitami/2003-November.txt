Interesting... I saw the link at the bottom of the emails, but it was not at
all apparent that I needed to click "unsubscribe" to get to the archives. I
had previously gotten to the old archives, which were not threaded, by
digging around the Xitami web page. Not sure why there is no link there for
the newer archives. But even the newer archives are not well organized, and
I don't see a method of searching.

One easy thing to do with forums, is to email all messages to subscribers.
Then, if a subscriber wants to reply, the message can include a link which
takes him directly to the forum, and even to a "reply" page for that
particular message. Then there is no need to log in, and replying is just as
easy as replying to an email.

In other words, a forum can give you everything that the current list-server
offers, plus maintain far better organization, and have good archive
searching.

I've seen a couple of  comments here concerning a potential problem with 
email addresses in the archive.  But no one has mentioned the 
registration requirements for forums.  In the case of the InReview site, 
reading their "Privacy Policy", shows you have no privacy from them or 
anyone else they want to give your information to.  Considering all of 
the pop-up ads they have, I'm sure my already over-burdened spam filter 
would be getting an additional workout, if I was foolish enough to 
register with them.  The ads are bad enough, but I understand that 
something has to pay their bills, but a blatant we can do anything we 
want with your information is totally unacceptable.

PS: Don't respond saying they have an opt-out provision, because we all 
know that by the time you opt-out the damage is already done, if it has 
any meaning at all.

I have looked through the Archives and found one message in relation to
this, but no replies to the message.  (Okay, I only check back about 1 year
of archives, not all of them)

I have finally got my Perl running, hopefully.  The perl modules return data
at the command prompt, and when running them from windows.

But, under Xitami cgi-bin from a web page, I get a BLANK page in return....

Any suggestions?

Is your first print statement to the browser like the following
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
If so then are you printing all of the html needed.

Once again, you've missed [another] point: Mozilla is probably THE most
standards-compliant browser.  If the HTML served up "breaks" it, then
that HTML is at fault.

Rather than arguing in generalities, can you provide a sample of HTML
that works for a seriously NON-compliant browser like IE6, but fails for
Mozilla?  (A URL will suffice; then we can tear apart the author's
competence.)

It's also totally illegal if the "subscriber" resides within an EU state;
moreover, the forum's owner would be violating a law for which
extradition may exist, and is punishable by a fine of up to half-a-
million euro (that's well over USD600k) and/or five years' imprisonment.

SFAICS, we're FAR better off with the present arrangement of this mailing
list...

I agree, and I would be totally opposed to a forum that is hosted by one of
the "free" forum hosting services. They generally suck, and when they decide
to close their doors, you lose all the archives.

A forum can easily be set up and run on the Xitami web site, at no
additional cost. Then, iMatix can determine exactly how they want to set it
up. I run a forum on my web site (I test the scripts with Xitami!) -- I do
not require registration, posts can be anonymous (no email req'd), there are
no advertisers/sponsors/pop-ups, and all posts are emailed to subscribers.
Even non-subscribers who post a question, can select to have replies to that
question emailed to them, without having to subscribe to the forum.

 Seconded. Takes how many times to read the same number of messages on
a forum as compared to a mailing list? Even more so on a low-volume
list like this one. Those allegedly "efficient" forums are the best way
to waste your time.

I think it's clear by now that a majority is in favor of some sort of 
messageboard instead of this list (could we hold a referendum?)
But this won't help us much if everybody starts his own messageboard.
phpBB is the best-looking messageboard, and have lots of features (send 
e-mail to user when topic is updated, and so on), but without any support 
from Imatix, i will not use it.
It seems that Imatix is not interested very much in Xitami, it is time by 
now that they state their position.

Subject: [Xitami] Forums - Xitami - iMatix
Message-ID: <3FA57663.21383.246ECAE5@localhost>

Folks,

Coincidentally with the discussions here, we have been in the process 
of setting up a forum web site (using phpbb) which will include a 
place for Xitami.  The site will be on forums.imatix.org, and will be 
our way of supporting people who use our free software (not just 
Xitami).

I can't say whether this list will still be what people prefer or 
not, there are arguments for and against lists.  Personally I would 
like to see the list continue but I suspect that over time forums are 
easier to use, searchable, and simply provide richer ways to discuss 
complex issues.

In any case we will host the forum site, it will be central point of 
contact for all the users of our free software - Xitami being the 
most popular but not the only one.

To our loyal and patient users, I'd like to say thank you, first of 
all, and secondly to say that while we're a small team and we can't 
spend an enormous effort in improving and extending Xitami, we 
continue to work on it, find and fix bugs, make it more secure and 
more stable, and add features to it little by little.  Our own 
products depend more and more on Xitami, and this is because we 
believe in it.

This list, in particular, has been a remarkable source of information 
and help to Xitami users: a simple but solid lifeline to the hundreds 
of thousands of people to whom Xitami was not easy, nor obvious.  You 
helped make it so.  Thank you all.

Hello Marc,

MD> I think it's clear by now that a majority is in favor of some sort
MD> of messageboard instead of this list

You  obviously  have  a  bias in favour of message boards as I see the
opposite  as being true. It seems to me that the majority on this list
are in favour of continuing with it, including me.

Trawling  boards  is  time  consuming.  I know that because apart from
using  a  lot  of  web  boards in the past I used to run my own public
forums.  Each  have their merits, but on the whole forums lose out big
time  because  they  don't  provide  the same quality of response that
mailing lists do.

It  would  be  a  big mistake to drop list support in favour of forums
IMO.  Forums  should really serve to support and compliment this list,
not replace it.

MD> (could we hold a referendum=3F)

Why  exactly=3F  If  people  that  prefer lists stay here and those that
don't go it would save all this prolonged nonsense. This 'should we or
shouldn't we' dawdling isn't helping anyone, or this list.

But that doesn't fix their lack of Privacy.  Since you must register to 
read posting and if you register they can use your information anyway 
they see fit, they are a not anyplace anyone should register.

As far as their being a majority for message boards, I don't believe 
it.  I've seen the same people repeatedly supporting them but have not 
seen many regular users of the mailing kist doing so.  The mailing list 
has been working fine, leave it alone!

I hope this ends all the other discussions.  Like Pieter I support 
continued use of the mailing list but for those who want  a forum it is 
atleast from official and run by someone I can have some trust in.

Most likely a problem with the service installation, i.e. the way the 
service interacts with your directories.  Check the permissions and 
the user under which the server runs.  To debug, run the service in a 
command window, using the 'debug' option: "xisrv32 -d".

Okay, I think I have it all working.  (Well, sorta, the script I'm using is
buggy)

It's not a script that I wrote, so debugging it was kinda difficult...  I
don't really know Perl.  I'm thinking about learning it, but I usually write
my own LRWP, or CGI's in Win32.

But, thanks for the help.

P.S.  Anyone know a good WEBMAIL CGI or Perl script????  CPAN on my perl is
giving me trouble, so all the scripts that require 10,000 add-on modules are
killing me.


One more thing, I have 2 cents about v2.5...  What did they do?????  Nothing
works right, did they start from scratch?  Things that worked just fine in
2.4 stopped working in 2.5...
I've currently downgraded, that's one reason that helped solve my problem.

Do you have a more specific error message?  It sounds like a problem 
with Windows' networking, or possibly up-stream if you're working 
through a firewall.

The messages are Xitami's report that the socket has had an error, 
and this is usually due to something going wrong somewhere along the 
connection between Xitami and the browser.

If iMatix would utilize the Win32 OpenSSL Installation Project into Xitami
instead of statically linking it, there wouldn't be an issue here and they
would have considerably less overhead.  It would be up to everyone to
either build OpenSSL themselves or use the default build provided by the
Win32 OpenSSL Installation Project:

Hello Michael,

On Thu, 06 Nov 2003 12:32:09 +0000 your time, you said:

MG> Easier  said  than  done,  i  have tried using cuteftp but i get a
MG> message  command  not  implemented....

Well  I  wouldn't  do  that  just  yet. If you are running Xitami on a
Windows OS you don't do anything. CHMOD isn't supported, and you don't
need to set permissions, usually. It should work OK as is.

I  have  CGI forums setup under Xitami on a W2K Pro machine and didn't
need to set any permissions for the files, so I imagine the same would
apply for your script.

I'll see if I can help.  Windows XP does not support chmod so no 
matter what server you are using it will say option not implemented 
or take the command and do nothing.  However if your script 
wished a file to be "read only" you can set that on a file by doing 
from a command prompt "attrib +r filename.ext" or you can use 
windows explorer right click the file and go to properties to chose " 
read only" check box.  Some scripts wish things like the config 
script set to read only to protect against being rewriten by a hacker.  
If that is the case setting it read only may end the error.

I have isolated the problem down to "specific" users.  When 
running Xitami 2.4d10 or 2.5 all the web pages fail loading 
prematurly and "smhttp: error on socket" is echoed to the console 
display.  If I switch back to Xitami 2.4d9 these users can download 
the webpages the same as everybody else.

Well  I  wouldn't  do  that  just  yet. If you are running Xitami on a
Windows OS you don't do anything. CHMOD isn't supported, and you don't
need to set permissions, usually. It should work OK as is.

I  have  CGI forums setup under Xitami on a W2K Pro machine and didn't
need to set any permissions for the files, so I imagine the same would
apply for your script.

Well  I'm  afraid  you  are mistaken about what you think you know, or
there  is  a misunderstanding about what is being discussed. I suggest
you download YaBB 1 Gold SP1 and try it yourself if you have any doubt
about setting up forums on W2K without the need for CHMOD.

MG> this  is  not done automatically, once the file have been uploaded

Nope, not on W2K it doesn't. You can't! Simple as that. If you need to
set  permissions  in W2K you'll have to do it the Windows way, not via
CHMOD.

MG> i  would  love  it  if you can prove me wrong, and direct me to an

Well my forums are at forums.infowizard.co.uk but they are private and
contain  private postings so I'm afraid I can't give you access to put
you mind at rest.

This  is  a  mailing  list, not a web board. It is the *Xitami mailing

That's your prerogative of course. Patience is a virtue of course, and
as  this  is  a user list you can't expect people to be around 24/7 to
answer   every   query   instantly.   I  am  certain  that  there  are
knowledgeable people on this list who can help you, but you'll have to
spell  out  what  it  is  you  want  and  work with them to solve your
problem.

Are you saying that you do not have access to the Xitami Server on Win2k?
Then who installed it? Is there not someone who can just walk up to the
server and make the change? If it is your server you should set up some
remote software like rAdmin from www.famatech.com that way you can remote
into the Win2k server and change permissions. That's what I do. If it's not
my server then I ask the administrator to do it.

Well actualy he does know what he's talking about.  As I said 
earlier CHMOD is a Linux/Unix command function that does not 
exist on Win systems.  Under windows the normal settings is all 
"programs" have access to read/write to all of your hard drive.  
Thus Xitami can read/write/execute any file you have given it 
access too.  A Unix shell account has more security so you have to 
CHMOD or give permissions to each individual file as to what 
access you will allow.  

Most CGI writers understand this and allow for this.  They 
recommend you to chmod on *nix systems and just install and go 
on Win systems as the permissions already exist.  This IS the case 
as I run a web page hosting site under Xitami and many users have 
installed their own forums (PHPBB, Ikonboard, PHPNUKE, Xoops, 
etc) without the need for CHMOD.

If you are still having problems I would guess this to be one of two 
issues.  The script is writen for *nix only.  Some writers only wish to 
support free OS or have nothing to do with Windows so do not 
support it.  The other possibility is your Xitami is not running as 
"Administrarors" and your setup is blocking access to something 
based on a security setting.  You can check these settings under 
Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Local Security Settings.  An 
easier way to do this may be to the the "Cacls" command to give 
Admin privlidges to your Xitami directories. 
http://www.networkclue.com/os/Windows/commands/cacls.php

If you have a script that wishes a file read only use Windows 
Explorer and right-click the file, chose properties and chose read-
only.

I've installed quite a few online forums and none so far have 
required Chmod unless they ran under unix.

Make sure that XP's internal firewall is disabled.

  Hello Daniel,

  No, I have nothing on the XP machine, other than whatever may be built 
into the O/S itself..  I simply downloaded into a clean machine, ran the 
Windows install, and it appeared to be set up right!  And if I were the only 
one testing it, I still would not know otherwise, because as I mentioned, it 
is accessable to me, using all methods!!   Yes, Daniel, they have tried 
"every" way I know of.. They've tried: http://www.mysite.com, 
www.mysite.com,  mysite.com, as well as the numerical address; ie: 
xx.xx.xx.xxx and http://xx.xx.xx.xxx ..  "ALL OF THEM" to no avail..  And 
yes, one friend  DID attempt to ping it, and it came back: unable to 
establish connection, or failure to recognize..  "?" or something like that! 
  As if it were NOT there!!   I have always had such good luck with Xitami 
"out of the box" that this has thrown me for a loop!  Thanks allot Daniel, 
for ANY HELP you might be able to offer, so I can find out what I need to do 
to get my site online!  Have  a good day sir!

Are you running any firewalls or routers?  Are your friends typing in a
URL or an IP?  If a URL then do you have the URL mapped to your IP?  Can
your friends ping your IP?

Hello Xitami users,

 For  some  reason  Xitami  crashed on my server the other day...still
 can't work out what caused it. It happens very occassionaly after the
 web  site  has been accessed. The software I use for monitoring ports
 sends  out  a  notification  email  when it polls a port and finds it
 unavailable,  so I got an email 10 minutes later. However, there's no
 feature  within  this  software  to perform any other action, such as
 restart Xitami.

 Does  anyone  know  of  a  utility/daemon  that could poll Xitami and
 restart  it  should  it fail to find an instance running=3F It would be
 extremely useful to have such a 'backup' in place for Xitami.

This is true in some cases, when Xitami is running under an account 
that has limited access rights.

There is a specific difference between Xitami and other web servers 
under Windows, namely that Xitami can run Perl, PHP, and other 
scripts without using the Windows registry.  Scripts do not need to 
'made executable', it's sufficient that they conform to the Unix 
standard of specifying the script interpreter in the first line.

Under Unix/Linux, CGI scripts must be marked as 'executable', which 
means using a chmod command, which must be done outside Xitami.  This 
means that Unix/Linux configurations are more secure, and more work.

If you want to set up a Xitami site to allow people to upload and run 
scripts, you have to ensure that (a) the web server account has the 
read/write accesses those scripts will need, and (b) that the various 
language interpreters you need (Perl, PHP,...) are installed and 
working.

Slán,

Ah, there is a mightily simple way of doing this that someone on this list
pointed me to.
Create a batch file which reads:

:start
xigui32.exe                     (for 2.4d10)
goto start

Make sure you have "recover from crashed silently" checked in Admin panel.
After most crashed Xitami will restart automatically.

Tom

Another good reason for running the service version
is that it seems to be more stable. fwiw, I've been running

there seems to be memory leak under heavy CGI exe use,

of that.)

Yes,  that  was  already  checked.  However,  I don't remember it ever
working.  So  is the "recover from crashed silently" feature dependent
on the batch file being present=3F

I've  just installed Xitami as a service and dropped the cpl file into
WINNT/system32.  After  opening the control panel applet I notice that
the  host  is  listed as localhost now, and not the machine host name.
And  the  field  listing  IP  addresses  that  Xitami  listens  on  is
empty...whereas  there  would  normally  be  two, the loopback and the
machine  IP. Is this the case with your installation=3F I know it's just
an  informational panel, but I got used to quickly verifying this info
via the tray control panel.

I just named mine xitami.bat (irrelevant, really), and launch that INSTEAD
of launching Xitami directly. Make sure you place this file in the same
directory as xigui32.exe.

Regarding service stability: I found that the service version was LESS
stable. In addition, every time it crashed, it wrote to a memtrace.lst file,
which it kept growing unitl it filled my hard drive. So the service
auto-restart neer came into play!
I never got the service version to run for more than a week. The console
version lasts up to 2 weeks. I recently upgraded my server to a P3-600,
768meg ram, new install of Win2kPro. So far it lasted 2 weeks before
crashing.
I run about 7 domains, a couple thousand hits a week, and the only thing
beyond HTML I run is a CGI counter.

Hello Tom,

On Sun, 9 Nov 2003 20:19:01 -0500 your time, you said:

TB> I just named mine xitami.bat (irrelevant, really), and launch that
TB> INSTEAD of launching Xitami directly.

Sorry,  I  misunderstood  you.  I was assuming that the process was an
automatic one and that the batch file was called by Xitami. Thanks for
your  suggestion  though,  but  I  really  wanted something that would
restart Xitami without any intervention from me. However, I did manage
to put together a rough workaround that didn't cost anything.

First  of all I downloaded a free program called Active Server Watcher
from here: http://www.ntutility.com/freeware_2.html.

Then I downloaded this free command line utility called 'process' from
here: http://www.beyondlogic.org/consulting/processutil/processutil.htm

'Active  Server  Watcher'  monitors  web resources so I created a page
called  poll.htm  under  Xitami  and  set  ASW  to poll that every few
minutes. If the page becomes unavailable I have set ASW to test 5 more
times  before  running  an external file. The file is xigui32.bat (see
below).  However,  I didn't want to just load a new instance of Xitami
just  because  a  page  wasn't  reachable because as it may be totally
unrelated  to Xitami, and could after all be DNS or temp network fault
etc. So I use the freeware commandline file 'process' to terminate any
running instance of xigui32.exe first and then the batch reloads a new
instance, making certain that only one instance of Xitami is running.

- --- BEGIN xigui32.bat

BEGIN:
X:
cd X:\[path]\Xitami
goto KILL

:KILL
process.exe -k xigui32.exe
goto RESTART

:RESTART
start xigui32.exe
goto END

:END
- --- END xigui32.bat

This works fine. It may not be the 'cleanest' way to do it but it is a
workaround.

Subject: [Xitami] Q: How Do I cascade webmask and passwords in aut-files?
Message-ID: <20031111105032.79621.qmail@web12505.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi!

This is my first post here, I hope im on the right
list :)

Here's my problem:

I want to have restricted access to certain areas. The
restriction should be as follows:
- If the request is coming from an IP matching the
webmask, allow access without asking for an account or
password (like "all=*").
- If the IP does NOT match the webmask, then ask for
an account and password (like "myuser=passwd".

So basically this means that access id granted for
people who either have a certain IP or know the
password, but noone needs both.

Is there any way to archieve this with the
"defaults.aut" and "xitami.aut"?

Thanks for any info on this.

Hello !

This is a normal feature.
The HTTP_REFERER only gives you the page, not the query string.
To get the query string, use the environment variable QUERY_STRING.

Thanks Marc, I got as far in my testing but it still isn't a perfect
solution.

I have a page http://localhost/index.cgi?page=map

>From that page, I click
http://localhost/index.cgi?page=map&action=travel&map=1&cor=1,4

My resulting $ENV hash produces

QUERY_STRING => page=map&action=travel&map=1&cor=?286,265
HTTP_REFERER => http://localhost/index.cgi

When what I really want is http://localhost/index.cgi?page=map

Now I can easily parse the string in Perl, but that's not the issue.
Eventually I want to run these scripts on a non-Xitami server and I want to
do it "the right way". I've used Apache in the past and HTTP_REFERER would
give me what I am here looking for. Is there any way that Xitami could be
configured such that in this example HTTP_REFERER would include the
referring URL and the referring URL's query string (And not the current
request's query string)?

Thanks!

No you don't; the "page" is immutable: it is the document whose URI is
<http://localhost/index.cgi>.  That is, and must, remain as the only
correct content for HTTP_REFERER.

> From that page, I click
> http://localhost/index.cgi?page=map&action=travel&map=1&cor=1,4

Which is what I would expect.

It did?  I'm surprised; I cannot find any examples in any RFCs that
include anything after the path part of the URI.

Sorry I can't help you towards your goal; merely pointing out that your
goal might well not be attainable.

Hello all,

I have phpBB2 2.06 running with PHP 4.3.4 and MySQL 
There is a very common problem with users of various
browser's in that their browsers arent refreshing the pages
properly. I suspect that this may have to do with the Xitami
server.

I use this in all of my overall_headers
<meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="must-revalidate">
you would think that the pages would refresh each visit, Ive 
also instructed IE users to change the Temporary Internet setting
for Checking of newer versions of stored pages to every visit to
the page....

Could it be that the header info sent by the server is over-riding the
php headers I sen out?

Has anyone ran across this and/or can/would help

Thanks you

Hello again all,

Here is an email I recieved from someone on a forum I have that uses phpBB2:

>Your site is trying to access odd ports each time I try to login to the private message section.
>The ports appear to be somewhat consecutive, but not are not standard web ports afaik.

>Source..
>(ip addy removed) port range: 63460-63512 and counting

>Destination port range: is all over the place, mostly in the range of 1000 to 4000

Can someone collaborate on this for me and present a fix that will work
to keep people from having loggin issues on my site. Last week I wrote
that some people were having refresh issues and this could be one reason
they are having the roblems.

Thanks in advance

Hello Fellow Subscribers

    I'm using Xitami on a Windows Machine and was wondering how to get a CGI 
Script that was made for Unix and used sendmail to work with Xitami?? I'd 
actually like the script to mail through an SMTP Server on another Windows 
Machine. Any Suggestions out there??

Thanks

Dan

Subject: [Xitami] Getting Xitami to Mail Through A CGI Script?
Message-ID: <Law15-F79fyY0QUUBPc000182c1@hotmail.com>

Heres the CGI code you need for a windows machine.  For clarification, 
Xitami doesn't actually interact with email unless you are using something 
special I don't know about.  To use CGI you would use perl scripts designed 
for a Unix or Windows platform....the code below is for a windows 
environment and requires you to have loaded the Net package from the 
activestate perl libraries, use the command line PPM program (found in 
/perl/bin) to install additional modules and packages.  (PPM>> install 
libnet).

Hope it helps.

#! /perl/bin/perl
#### Needed to actually communicate with any SMTP server
use Net::SMTP ;
#### Needed to retrieve FORM info regardless if its a GET or POST
use CGI ;
$query = new CGI ;

#### values passed in from any standard HTML form, either post or get
#### These values are NOT being used in the script below
$subject = $query->param('subject') ;
$fromAdd = $query->param('fromAdd') ;
$toAdd = $query->param('toAdd') ;

### Get date and time if you want to include it the CONTENT BODY of the 
email
### very simple getDate
   $sec = (localtime)[0] ;
   $min = (localtime)[1] ;
   $hour = (localtime)[2] ;
   $day = (localtime)[3] ;
   $mon = (localtime)[4] + 1 ;
   $year = (localtime)[5] + 1900 ;

###### OR preassemble the date.
   $curDate = (localtime)[5] + 1900) . "-" . ((localtime)[4] + 1) . "-" . 
(localtime)[3] ;
   $curTime = (localtime)[2] . ":" . (localtime)[1] . ":" . (localtime)[0] ;

### connect to SMTP server
   $smtp = Net::SMTP->new(desired.mailserver.com, Debug => 1,) or die "can't 
connect to server $!" ; ### specify FROM address
   $smtp->mail("blah\@blah.com") ;
### specify TO address
   $smtp->to("xitami\@lists.xitami.org") ;
### Start data string
   $smtp->data() ;  # Start the mail

### this section mimicks the header info the user actually sees. (its 
actually just data though)
   $smtp->datasend("To: xitami\@lists.xitami.org\n") ;
   $smtp->datasend("From: blah\@blah.com\n") ;
   $smtp->datasend("Subject: Xitami CGI SMTP interaction\n") ;

### next section commented out but would allow you to send HTML formatted 
emails (still just data)
   #$smtp->datasend("\nMIME-Version: 1.0") ;
   #$smtp->datasend("\nContent-Type: text/html\;") ;
   #$smtp->datasend("\n	charset=\"iso-8859-1\"") ;
   #$smtp->datasend("\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable") ;
   #$smtp->datasend("\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE 
V5.50.4522.120") ;

### here is the CONENT of your email (still just data)
   $smtp->datasend("\nJust send info all day long") ;
   $smtp->datasend("\nJust send info all day long") ;
   $smtp->datasend("\nJust send info all day long") ;
   $smtp->datasend("\nJust send info all day long") ;
   $smtp->datasend("\nJust send info all day long") ;
   $smtp->datasend("\nJust send info all day long") ;
   $smtp->datasend("\n.........") ;

### finish sending the DATA portion and transmit email
   $smtp->dataend() ;

### close SMTP Session
   $smtp->quit ;

#### end perl script

Send mail for windows is still going.  A company called Indigo has it but
they are charging $49.  It can be found here:
http://www.indigostar.com/sendmail.htm
A free program can be downloaded called Blat that does the same thing as
sendmail and can be found here:

Hey Daniel thanks for that, I just assumed they quit I know it was talked
about had it in perl 5.22 but thought they dropped it I have an old
sendmail.pm file somewhere on one of my HD's but @ 5.8 I don't think it will
be compatible :) will have to check out indigostar I forgot about them.

No Problem.  Take a look at Blat.  I have not used it but have heard that it
is rather easily to convert perl programs to use it instead of sendmail.
