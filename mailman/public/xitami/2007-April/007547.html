<PRE>Hi, Have been using xitami for years with an LRWP processes. Out of
dozens of sites, xitami freezes at one. When the browser makes a
request, it hangs for a long time. I have seen it come back and start
responding again after a very long time, say maybe 15 minutes. Usually
by then somebody has noticed that its down and has restarted the server.
All sites have 2.4d9 installed on them and I tried 2.4d11 with the same
results.

Its not hanging on an LRWP request. It hangs on just serving up a static
webpage. In the access log, I can see the request to get the page, then
some graphics on the page, but it all gets back to the browser.

This happens after the server has been running awhile, approximately 4-8
hours.

Does anyone have any idea what it could be, or what I could look at next
to diagnose it?

Thanks,
Brian

</PRE>
