<PRE>Ok, this may be a clue. I was getting ready to stop and restart the
service using the control panel applet and as soon as I opened it - you
guessed it - xitami took off. I noticed it because I had a browser page
waiting on a response the whole time I was looking at it. As soon as I
opened the control panel applet, the page completed loading.

After running 6 hours or so, it hung up today. In task manager there is
nothing out of line that I can see. Hardly any cpu in use (4-8%) Xitami
is using 0. There is 211 meg of memory avaialble. Xisrv32.exe is using
2,785k of memory, 83 handles, 3 threads, 0 user objects. 705 IO reads
for 1,723,515 bytes, 259 IO writes for 130,967 bytes. The IO numbers
aren't changing.

Since it's always happening on the same machine, I'd suspect either
interference from another process, or hardware issues.  When Xitami
blocks, pull up the task manager and see what is going on.
