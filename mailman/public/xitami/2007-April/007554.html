<PRE>It did it again! I opened a browser and it hung waiting for the
response. As soon as I opened the control panel applet, the page loaded.
I'm going to leave the applet open for a while and see what happens.

As for power options the computer is set to always keep disk and monitor
power on. The screen saver is set to go to a blank screen after 1 minute
and prompt for a password to come out of it. The LAN card has no &quot;power
saving&quot; options checked.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Brian

That might have been a cached page from the browser cache.  IE will do 
that - other browsers might too.

Does your computer, by any chance, sleep/hibernate?  Check your &quot;Power 
Management&quot; settings and see if any components go to sleep after a set 
amount of time.  Check your screensaver settings as well.
