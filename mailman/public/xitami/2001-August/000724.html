This is an ordinary DNS look-up. The 207.69.188.186 address is similar
to the one you used to mail your note, so I assume it is your ISP's DNS
server. Port 53 is in fact DNS service (I had to check). Xitami seems to
want to know who 192.168.0.2 is. 

I'm not sure I understand the answer it gets, and I'm not sure Xitami
liked it. The &quot;packet size error&quot; is also odd.

FWIW: <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/">http://www.isi.edu/</A> is the engineering school at The University of
Southern California. They say they've been around since the 1870s, and
have had a quarter million students. So the organization is legit, but
who knows what those engineering students are doing. The odd DNS results
may just mean that someone plugged in a laptop in the Lab. 

Why is Xitami doing DNS look-ups? There IS an option to do that, but we
generally leave it turned off because it is very slow. Maybe you enabled
it?
