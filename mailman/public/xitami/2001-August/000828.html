Brad,

No, a path entry for php isn't necessary (but it might be worth trying at this
point !), I even went to the extent of moving php4ts.dll from the Xitami
directory to the wnint\system32 directory &amp; deleting php.exe &amp; php4ts.dll from
the C:\php directory &amp; all still functions perfectly.

Correction - I found out what is happening, - instead of just accepting that my
installation was working I had a poke around to see if I could reproduce the
'blank page problem' .... it happens when php.exe can't locate php4ts.dll, if
you do a 'view source' on the blank page you will see that php has produced the
headers then given up when unable to load it's main dll.

It just so happened that when I moved php.exe to C:\Xitami I also moved
php4ts.dll which allowed it to be found. Now I've moved php.exe to c:\php &amp;
altered the filter to point to c:\php\php.exe and all works fine when php4ts.dll
is placed in winnt\system32.

My suggestion - place php4ts.dll in the winnt\system32 directory, it will always
get found there.

Best of luck, Paul

Paul:

As per your instructions below, I have repeatedly tried to get Xitami
and PHP to coordinate efforts, but I am still getting blank pages!
Wah!

Just by chance, does autoexe.bat need to have a line added to it
so that Windows knows where PHP is located?  That is the only
thing I haven't done yet.

Sincerely,
Brad Smith
