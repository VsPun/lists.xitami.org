<PRE>I don't want anyone blocking ports for me ... I believe that this
problem is severely annoying in terms of my log files, but I would
always have 'the user' control as much as possible.  I think that the
limited use of port 80 by some ISPs removes the ability of the
individual to decide what they want to do.

My 2 cents.

Only Windows NT/2000 machines running IIS 4/5 are vulnerable to the
attack.

Don't wait for your ISP to start blocking ports. Write to them now
telling them that you do NOT run a web server that can be exploited by
Code Red. Tell them that if they block HTTP requests that you will find
another ISP who is more attuned to the real world.

As Arlo Guthrie said, &quot;if enough of us get together they'll think its a
movement&quot;. Don't let your ISP determine what gets to your server, it is
not their place. This is an administrative issue, not an ISP issue. Take
the initiative. Hit them where it hurts, paying the bill.

It is just like voting in the states, the powers that be are there to
serve us, not us there to serve them.
