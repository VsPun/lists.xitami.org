&gt;<i>I've installed Xitami and PHP4 on a Windows 2000 box and everything is
</I>&gt;<i>working fine except I can't see an FORM POST fields in the PHP script.
</I>&gt;<i>ie. When Submit is pressed the field values are all empty when the PHP
</I>&gt;<i>script processes it.
</I>
I never liked this about PHP (or at least I could never figure it out), but
the HTTP_POST_VARS hash is a bit strange.  Basically, your variables are
converted from the hash into normal variables:

phpinfo() shows something like this -
HTTP_POST_VARS[&quot;MyVariable&quot;] = MyValue
MyVariable = MyValue

Referencing it like this doesn't work as expected:
if ($HTTP_POST_VARS[&quot;MyVariable&quot;] == &quot;MyValue&quot;)
{
}

However, referencing it like this does:
if ($MyVariable == &quot;MyValue&quot;)
{
}

&gt;<i>I've searched the archives and have seen a few other people mention
</I>&gt;<i>this problem but haven't seen any solutions posted. I've waisted best
</I>&gt;<i>part of a day on this and it is driving me nuts. Xitami looks good,
</I>&gt;<i>but if I can't get this resolved quickly I guess I'll move to Apache.
</I>
Apache is horribly unstable under Windows with PHP (especially with
mod-ssl).  I wasted an entire week re-building that piece of junk from
scratch using every option possible (I personally would write my own web
server if I had a choice between that and Apache - it's a good thing Xitami
exists).  Just thought you would like a heads-up.

&gt;<i>On another note why haven't the Archived Mailing lists been updated
</I>&gt;<i>for many months?
</I>
Check the headers of this post for links to the new archives.

Hope this helps!
