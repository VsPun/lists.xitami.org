Hi Paul,

thanks for your note ... I am not planning to roll my own script,
rather I am wanting to set up a &quot;testing evironment&quot; on my Win2k PC
where I can test websites using mysql database connection without
having to be connected to the internet all the time and uploading
files to the actual internet server at my ISP ...

Thus I want to install a mysql on my local machine and wondered how I
can now connect to it, since seemingly would require a server or
something (as it does on my ISP's server as well ...). Since I am
using Xitami as my webserver and have installed php4 to run under
Xitami, I thought perhaps I needed to do something else here to &quot;hook
up&quot; mysql with xitami as webserver as well ... The mysql items needed
to connect from a domain / website to it are a &quot;host&quot; (server), the
database name, username and password ... and it is the first one (the
&quot;host&quot; / server) which I was wondering about ... if perhaps I need to
somehow setup a &quot;virtual host&quot; or something for the mysql server ...

Sorry if I am causing confusion ... but I am a newbie at this mysql
connection to webservers etc ... was able to manage the php
installation without trouble, but this one somehow seems as if I just
can't &quot;see it&quot; (see what needs to be done)
Any help is appreciated !
God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang
