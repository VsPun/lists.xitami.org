<PRE>If you were the world-famous author I'd say use &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; but you 
might be someone else.  ;D

There are far more weird people in the world then there is time to track 
them down.  If the information and images are too revealing you may 
want to tone the site down a little until the &quot;stalker&quot; gets bored and 
leaves.

There could be some rational and totally non-weird reason for their 
behavior you haven't thought of.   You might just have your first groupie!  

If they have a static ip you might try searches (esp google) for the ip as 
this sometimes appears in some listings.

Put in comment areas, esp in places the lurker frequents.  Gather 
information as it's amazing how far you can get on just a little 
information.  If they play an instrument, such as a cello, they are 
probably listed in a music directory somewhere.  My oldest daughter, a 
budding geneologist, can track down nearly anyone but without a huge 
budget she needs more than just an ip.

Also, change your website around.  Keep the root level clean without 
links and change the directory names for areas you'd prefer to keep 
more  private.  If the lurker quickly finds their way into the private areas, 
you know to look within close circles or co-workers.
