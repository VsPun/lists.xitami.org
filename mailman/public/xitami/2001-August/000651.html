Huh?  I fail to see what use it would be to modify anything on YOUR
machine: if Verizon are filtering port 80, then no request will get
anywhere near your machine.

You could run Xitami on a different port, but people would have to be
told to contact, say <A HREF="http://your.host:8006/">http://your.host:8006/</A> instead of plain
<A HREF="http://your.host/.">http://your.host/.</A>

I would think that your best course of action is to show Verizon that you
don't like them interfering with YOUR traffic (on the specious grounds
that some OTHER customers may be too stupid to know that they're running
a buggy piece of MicroCrap), and move to a different ISP.  If you have a
public forum (such as a newsgroup) within the Verizon camp for other
customers, I suggest you start campaigning therein.

Oh, and while you're at it, please adjust your mailer so that it wraps
lines automatically; your post consisted of two very long lines of text
(the first was 255 characters).  The accepted norm in e-mail and usenet
is 72--76 characters per line; note that the very recently published new
standard for e-mail, RFC-2822, still insists that lines should be of this
sort of length (although permitting longer ones WHERE APPROPRIATE).
