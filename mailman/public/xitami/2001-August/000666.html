<PRE>Ewen,
   I don't know if this is Becky's reason or not, but I too have tried to do
this.  I have a web based email application (rather popular one by Windows
standards) that runs on port 3001.  My clients get their mail bu going to:
<A HREF="http://mail.domainname.com:3001.">http://mail.domainname.com:3001.</A>  Great, but most of my customer don't
understand ports and I end up fielding a lot of calls because they get my
home page instead of their email.  I've ended up running the email and web
servers on two different machines to avoid the port problem, but I also have
a calendar application that runs (by default) on port 8060.  I really don't
want to license 3 copies of Windows (almost the cost of the hardware!) just
to make the lives of my customers easy, but I don't have a lot of choice.
   I'm not well versed enough in LRWP and filters, but I can write a pretty
good CGI executables.  Is there any good possibilities there?  Is it
possible to set up a virtual host (say mail.domainname.com) that would
redirect to the email web server on the same PC only on port 3001?  That
would be pretty cool.

TIA -- Joe

Intelligent front end proxy?

Certainly for CodeRed you can't hope to send it a redirect!

About the only other thing I could think of is that you could run a
LRWP, filter, etc, that received the request on port 80 (which is where
it WILL be made), and then made another connectin to port 4080 on your
machine, and then returned the result of that.

I can't for the life of me think of why you'd want to waste resources
doing that.

FWIW, I do know that some ISPs are using their intelligent transparent
proxies to either block the CodeRed requests, or direct them somewhere
other than their webservers.  But those things tend to be Rather
Expensive (tm).
