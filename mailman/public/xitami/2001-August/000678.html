Be sure to add me to your email list when your book comes out.

You shouldn't start out trying to get web site security by using methods 
like robots.txt, logins and passwords, scripting, filtering, etc.

Keeping the root level clean and without links simply means don't do what 
most people do which is link to everything in the web site.  Lurkers can find 
anything and search engines will rip your entire site in seconds and put it 
on public display.

Consider your root level the base of the tree.  Lurkers and others come in 
but that's all they see.  A dead end :::gasp:::

Now you can list subdirectories or branches with search engines.  The very 
most a lurker or search engine can get is that branch.  Everything else is 
invivisible unless they know it exists.  For instance, on the same domain, 
clients can get business stuff but only special people can see pictures of 
me and the family getting sunburned at Disneyworld this summer.

If a lurker finds their way into places you'd rather they didn't, all you need 
to do is change the directory name and *poof* it's invisible again and 
there's no need to redo all your links or redo logins and passwords.  You 
will have to contact those who you wish to see certain pages.  
Surprisingly, the list of people who are able to see me with Mickey Mouse 
is quite small. (Hi Mom!)

Xitami is a great web server for the home but people with one computer 
:::<i>gasp again::: who share their most personal stuff on the same box as 
</I>their web pages are nuts.  Xitami don't require much firepower so if you 
want lots of instant security, dedicate a cheap $200 computer for your web 
server.

Have fun!

Michael
