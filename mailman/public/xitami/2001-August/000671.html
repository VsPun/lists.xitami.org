<PRE>&gt;<i>  I understand I can host my own web site with the xitami server and use a regular isp as a &quot;backbone.&quot;  Is this true,
</I>
Install Xitami. 

Open a browser on the same PC and tell it to open
&quot;<A HREF="http://localhost".">http://localhost&quot;.</A> You see Xitami's default page. You can edit
or replace that with your own page. 

Now, do you want everybody in the world to see it? To do so, they
need to know how to find your machine and they strictly need an
IP number like 257.103.87.290. However if your IP number is
listed in a DNS server (generally your ISP has one) they can type
a friendly URL instead of the IP number and the DNS will look-up
the right number for them. 

If you use a dial-up connection, you get a different IP number
every time you dial. There are ways to get this to &quot;work&quot;, but
they are clumsy and you may not want to have the phone line open
all day and night. (Most ISPs will drop your connection if idle.)

If you use a cable-modem or DSL line, you are on-line all the
time. However your IP number *may* change from time to time, as
the ISP adjusts their routers, or frankly to make it hard to run
a server when paying for a home-only connection. 

What you really want is an always-on connection with a &quot;fixed IP&quot;
address, and DNS service that links a friendly URL like
&quot;pauls-site.nii.net&quot; to that IP number. That's usually more
expensive than a simple home-surfer connection. 

In my case, I'm in a school with decent backbone connection.
However it cost well over $5,000 to get this building connected
(not wired, just to have a router patched to the campus
backbone). That covers a couple dozen workers and 5 public
webservers, but was still quite a gulp.
