Hi Peter,

Those lines look okay IF they really do both begin with semi-colons (;) then
they will simply be treated as comment lines.

The installer must have mangled them from the default line which is ...

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Paths and Directories ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
include_path   =               ; UNIX: &quot;/path1:/path2&quot;  Windows: &quot;\path1;\path2&quot;
doc_root  =    ; the root of the php pages, used only if nonempty

This is how my system is setup, because I don't use any implicit includes - this
 explicitly sets the default include
path to null  instead of using any compiled in default. You might try this
syntax &amp; see how much mileage you get.

As I said if the lines begin with a ; then they will be treated as comments, I
would be likely to check the line FOLLOWING
the line the error is reported on, i.e. Line 315

Also if you set the following values On earlier in the ini file you make get
helpful messages displayed in your
browser, 'display_startup_errors defaults' to Off

display_errors =    On
display_startup_errors = On

Also, although it appears you may already have 'log_errors' set to On (since
you're getting server error logs) , I would
check to make sure 'log_errors' is in fact set to On.

Although I think you've almost cracked it, another thing I've found is that you
will get the blank pages if php.exe can't locate
php4ts.dll - it should either be in the Xitami directory along with php.exe
(since that is Xitami's cwd when starting php) or in
c:\winnt\system32. In fact I've found that php.exe can be left in c:\php (and
the Xitami filter entry altered to match php.exe's
location of course) if php4ts.dll is placed in c:\winnt\system32 .

Hope that's enough to nudge you in the right direction...

Regards, Paul

Hi Paul,

you are right,  just blank pages. I reinstalled the whole thing and
still get blank pages.

On the commandline i get:
C:\&gt;which php.exe
D:\Programme\Xitami\php.exe

It's in the right place. My ini-file is untouched;
the permissions of php.exe are set to full access for everybody.

In defaults.cfg i see:
[Filter]
    .php=php.exe

In my cgierr.log i see:
PHP:  Error parsing C:\WINNT\php.ini on line 314

In my untouched ini these are the lines 313-314:

; Windows: &quot;\path1;\path2&quot;
;include_path = &quot;.;c:\php\includes&quot;

So, i assume this is the mistake. I played around with the two
variables with no result yet.

Regards,  Peter
