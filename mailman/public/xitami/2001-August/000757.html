&gt;<i> A little system information:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pentium 233MMX
</I>&gt;<i> 32-Megs of memory
</I>
Your main problem is probably right here.  Xitami has, IMO, not-so-great
memory management since it is generally built under MSVC++ for the various
Windows builds.  You are probably running out of memory (usually happens
when running CGIs like PHP) and then the MSVC library fails, thus Xitami
fails.  The library probably fails since it will generally lock itself in
real memory (so it can't be swapped out), then when you get enough locks
and zero memory free, bam!  Windows kills the offending application (which
is Xitami).

My suggestion in this case is to get more memory (my system has 384MB RAM -
you probably don't need that much if you run a dedicated server - my
machine is a high-end workstation/server) and something like MemTurbo or
RamIdle (both utilities can free up real RAM when it gets low).

&gt;<i> Windows 95 OSR2 with latest patches.
</I>&gt;<i> Console reports nearly 9 megabytes of configuration usage (normal - system
</I>&gt;<i>has about 200 virtual hosts).
</I>
I normally don't recommend RAM purchases, but if you run 200 VHosts, they
probably need more than 32MB under any circumstance (Windows needs about
24MB to run decently (at least 16MB to run), add 9MB to that and you have
0MB of real RAM free and are probably doing some major hard drive
swapping).  128MB with RamIdle set to recover RAM at 25MB free should
provide you, your users, and more importantly the OS some breathing room.

Hope this helps!
