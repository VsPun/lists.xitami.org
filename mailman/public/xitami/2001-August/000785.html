<PRE>Hi,

as a bit of a newbie with PHP and Win2k,  I've succesfully installed
and used php on my Win2k computer with the Xitami 2.5b4 version for
testing web pages etc locally on my computer and not having to upload
things to the server of my
ISP.  Everything runs fine ... so it seems.

Today then, I just installed a mysql distribution under Win2K on my
machine as well, which apparently also successfully installed because
I can call up and start the mysql-nt server and have it running.  

Now ... here comes my question ...  
Could someone help me with setting things up so I can use this MySQL
to create a database and tables to use for a forum from one of my
websites I am testing and which has been assigned a &quot;vitual host&quot; ? 
Where do I assign a host name under Xitami for the mysql server (and
set user and password) to simulate the &quot;real&quot; situation of later on?
For example: The website is at www.domain01.de (my domain), and the
MySQL runs on mail.domain02.com (my ISP's mail server, where he has
the mysql server installed) and I want then to use the PHP/MySQL
combination from the website to run a forum.  Is this done in a
similar fashion to setting up PHP with entries under &quot;filter&quot;?

If someone could point me in the right direction and perhaps coach my
along a little bit, I would greatly appreciate it ... perhaps better
done off list.
God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang
