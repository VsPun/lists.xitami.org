<PRE>
When you state that you 'create a virtual directory named 'greene', do you mean
simply a directory under 'Xitami\webpages' or are you creating a virtual host ?

There is a simple way to see if php is working. Open a DOS box, go to the
directory containing 'today.php' and type 'path to php.exe'\php today.php (eg
c:\xitami\php today.php). You should be blessed with the expected output from
your php script on the console.

I installed php way before Xitami so I didn't have the option of telling the
installer about Xitami, however the setup is just a matter of setting the Xitami
php filter &amp; moving 2 files, php.exe &amp; php4ts.dll.

In any case the virtual directory question may be the most important.

Ok, I have uninstalled Xitami and PHP and started cleanly.

Here are the steps I have taken in order, but I still get a blank page
when I initiate the .php file in the web browser:
1.  Reinstall Xitami
2.  In Xitami, create a virtual directory named 'greene'.  Therefore,
the site root would be '<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/greene'.">http://127.0.0.1/greene'.</A>
3.  In the 'greene' root, I created a .php file named 'today.php'.
4.  I unzipped the PHP .zip file (obtained from php.net) into the
xitami directory (c:\xitami).
5.  In the Xitami directory, I created a copy of the php.ini file, and
left all the .dll's there as well.
6.  I copied the php.ini file to the Windows directory (c:\windows).
7.  I copied the php*.dll file to both the c:\windows\system and the
c:\windows\system32 directories.
8.  I reset the Xitami server.
9.  From MSIE, I went to <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/greene/today.php.">http://127.0.0.1/greene/today.php.</A>

Still no resolution.  Still a blank page!  I have a sound file that
makes me aware that the php.exe file does load, then displays a
blank page again.  What am I doing wrong?!?!?  This has made me
feel like an incredible loser, since I have never had this much
trouble.  Furthermore, even when I try to install PHP from the
executable PHP file, the installation informs me that it cannot find
the Xitami server directory and that I will have to manually configure
the server.  What is the purpose of having the installer if the end-
user still has to manually configure PHP?!?!?

Sincerely,
Brad Smith
