<PRE>I wrote my own, and it turns out it was much more simple than most of the 
shareware/freeware out there - a pretty small and optimized database (just a 
few tables) with just a few perl scripts.

You know, I might be inclined to write a Xitami Forum that would share in 
the mailing list.  I can write a script that parses any incoming mail that 
had a new topic which would be the start of a new disucssion and any 
subsequent reply &quot;Re:&quot; would be added to that discussion all organized by 
timestamp.  So not only would we have the regular email list we all receive 
but then the everything would also be captured to a usable forum.

Its been a while since I wrote an email parser but it shouldn't be too 
hard - just have to capture the headers and search/insert into the DB from 
there.  anmyone want to join me on this one?  I imagine parseing out all the 
reply'd to info could be a bit difficult or weeding through each Replied to 
email to grab legitimate response lines.  Except for that part I think it 
would be rather easy to do the whole thing.

Subject: [Xitami] Simple forum software


&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i'm looking for a simple forum software that could run on Xitami (or any
</I>&gt;<i> other server) without much configuration. Server is windows 2000 or 2003.
</I>&gt;<i> The forum is not for me, but for an organisation and they don't know
</I>&gt;<i> anything about computers. I've tried a WAMP (windows-apache-mySQL-PHP)
</I>&gt;<i> solution, but it's really too complicated for the users to maintain.
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;free forum&quot; is not really an option, since it comes with lot of
</I>&gt;<i> advertising and there is nearly no control about the posts (lot of spam!).
</I>&gt;<i> Freeware or shareware OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
