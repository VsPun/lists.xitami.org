So, in anycase, there is no way for one LRWP to know about the other LRWP
connections (w/o some kind of explicit messaging via files/sockets/etc between
the LRWP programs)?

Yup.  But if it's all in one process (eg, using threads, or SMT) then
the LRWP connections will "know about each other" anyway.  The Java
Servlet Runner uses this sort of approach to handle state between the
servlets.

Hi,

Would you mind explaining what you mean by "just open multiple connections"?
I'm not sure why its all in one process-- don't you have to run multiple LRWP
peers (each which have their own memory space, etc)?  I think I'm
misunderstanding something.

Thanks,

The original question was whether a LRWP peer could handle multiple
requests simultaneously (ie, overlapping), to which my response was
"just open multiple connections" (there is only one request at a time per
connection).

You can achieve the multiple connections by running multiple instances
of the LRWP peer (ie, multiple processes), and that'll work fine.  But
if the LRWP instances need to share data then they'll have to do it via
a database (common technique), or via shared memory, a private
connection, etc.

If you want to avoid the overhead of reading/writing to a database, and
the hassle of shared memory code (particularly portable shared memory
code), then you could simply write a LRWP peer that opens multiple
sockets connected to Xitami, and registers itself on each one.  As far
as Xitami is concerned it's multiple LRWP peers, and they'll be used in
a round-robin fashion (or in a first-available fashion; depending on how
Xitami is configured).

There are basically three ways to handle the "multiple
connections/requests in one process" situation:
- OS level threading (kernel or system library threading)
- select()-style loops
- SMT

While you can do select()-style loops by hand, the design will rapidly
drive you nuts if it is of any size.  SMT allows you to abstract the
design further, and gives you "thread-like" execution of the
select()-style loop handling.

The important thing to remember is that as far as Xitami is concerned,
LRWP peers are just a socket connection to it, that has registered.  It
doesn't know anything else about them, and it doesn't care.  It just
sends them requests to be handled across the socket, one request per
socket.

Thanks... I convinced myself that it might have been an emulator problem
(w3gate), but when I try to access a simple wml page from my cell phone I
get a "content type not supported "text/vend.wap.wml""

On the MIME page in the Xitami config screen, I have File Extension as WML,
and then text/vend.wap.wml as the MIME Type...

COULD this be a Xitami issue?  Any other ideas?

thanks
Michael

Hi.
It is true, WML works.
You have to use different headers in CGI - correspondig with mime types for
WML.
And serve WML content, of course.

The effect is insignificant. The chunks are small and Xitami serves
data very soon after each packet is requested. The 56K connections
tend to get about all the data they can handle.

Which Xitami? Under NT, the Service Version is most stable.

The TCP/IP stack in NT 4 is flawed (not as flawed as in Win31, which
would stall every few days). However, my NT4 server runs for months
at a time, has been up since September. What seems to stall it (or
NT's IP stack) is certain FTP clients that my helpers use for huge
site uploads.

One thing- Xitami on NT4 "appears" more stable on my P-350/128M box
than it did on my P-150/32M box. While neither Xitami nor the TCP
stack needs much memory, and indeed it tended to sit with 24-28M
actually used, I wondered if there was something going on when peak
memory demands forced a swap-file action. With Xitami, RealServer,
and a VNC service running, I'm now using 40M out of 128M physical,
so swapping just doesn't happen.

The TCP/IP stack in XP is totally new (actually lifted from one of
the PC unix distributions) and reportedly better. But I've been
happy enough with NT4's uptime that I have not cared to move to XP
(and it certainly would not be snappy on a P-100/32M).

Hi.
Probably it is just a typo. Mime section should be:

[Mime]
     Wbmp=image/vnd.wap.wbmp
     Wml=text/vnd.wap.wml
     Wmlc=application/vnd.wap.wmlc
     Wmls=text/vnd.wap.wmlscript
     Wmlsc=application/vnd.wap.wmlscriptc

You have one "e" more.

I got it to work by re-installing Xitami and PHP (btw, on Windows 98
SE). I've changed the cgi.force_redirect to 0, without setting the
doc.root and then it works fine (but only used locally, because of
security-issues). I didn't have to make any further changes to the php.ini.

So you might try a fresh install.

You have to go into the configuration of Xitami. Then go to your vitural
host, then to Security. Press the Define button under Password file. Then
just put in the Authentification Realm, save everything, and press Restart.

first - thanks - my virtual hosts all work now for my intranet. i just
finished switching it live.

i am wondering if there is a way to add custom text to the username/password
box? i also run another website on apache and it is possible to do it with
that. is there a way in xitami to add some custom test to the login box?

thanks!

i finally managed it to compile b5 under os/2 and tried this
version in our multi-domain environment.

works, but doesnt recognizes any of the vhosts so i have to
implement my old patch from beta 4 again.

setup: xitami.cfg is almost empty and links to default.cfg

default.cfg contains a large list like this:

[Virtual-Hosts]
 chat.jabronis.org=\vhosts\chat.jabronis.org\vhost.cfg

in vhost.cfg, all ipadress, webpages, acesslog etc. parameters
are set.

is somebody using a similar setup ?

so I can have a developer version on my deployment machine to make sure
everything work before releasing new versions.


I tried xipro -b 5080 and I got a "Could not open http: port 80" message.

Xitami is running as a service , how can I add another service of xitami
running on a different port?

Thon,

The ones getting the errors are probably behind a firewall.
Tell them to use passive mode!
Is your server behind some sort of a firewall or broadband
router?=20

new features:
- is able to reload the whole servletrunner (eg. after

stop the xitami service running on port 80.
open the xitami WBA for the new service and change the "ip port base" from
"0" to "5000"
your new xitami service will then start on port 5080 (you may have to
stop/restart).
start the original service back up (it will still be on port 80)

i'm sure there's other ways to do this....

Quote from the FAQ:

"

You can run several copies of Xitami, each in a different directory, and =
each on a different port. Xitami is small enough that this will not slow =
down the system. In each directory, create a suitable defaults.cfg file =
with the server:portbase set to a different value.=20

"

The two keywords here are 'directory' and 'port'.
You will need to install TWO instances of Xitami,
in different directories, with a different port base,
and start the servers from their own respective directories.

'PUT' requires that your client app has the capability to invoke that
request: most browsers don't. It also has MAJOR security issues.
AND you need a script at the server that actually deals with the
put request. Using the upload mechanism with 'POST' and the
'multipart' mime type is probably much easier (although it would
still require a CGI program and has security issues!).
But why bother, when Xitami has such a nice FTP server built in?
Not even sure if Xitami supports 'put' requests!

Anyway, although the following article is about Apache, it DOES
contain some noteworthy information about using 'put' requests.
http://www.apacheweek.com/features/put

Hope it helps,

Hi Paul,

Thanks for the response. I understand the security concerns. I'm testing 
against networking equipment in a private lab with no access to the 
Internet, so security is not a major concern. I'm just trying to test the 
publish feature through an SLB. There was some thinly veiled information 
regarding the HTTP put in the user guide, Xitami does support it, but I 
just can't get it to work.

Thanks,

Sean

What your trying to do id use FrontPage extensions.  Xitami doesn't support
that protocal.  FP extensions is a special way to change files on a web
server.  I would recomend that you publish your pages with an FTP program.

Xitami does not now, nor will in the future support Front Page extensions. 
This has been a hot topic in the past.  If you're a savy enough programmer
Xitami is open source.  And the FrontPage is actually a documented protocal
so you could in theory build FP compatibility into Xitami.

Ervin,

No, I don't think he's referring to Frontpage. Just to HTTP's
'put' request. (See RFC 2068, under 9.6).

Xitami indeed states somewhere that they have no intention
to support Frontpage and gives as reason that it is not properly
documented and that they're not in the business of reverse
engineering Microsoft software.

So, since you claim FP to be a documented protocol, I would
be very interested in obtaining a link to that document!
Could you supply that to us?

Kind Regards,
Paul Claessen

Thanks for the responses. Paul is correct, I'm just trying to update a web 
page via an HTTP PUT using Netscape's Composer. My understanding is that 
this "Publish" feature I'm referring to uses an HTTP Put to update the html 
pages to servers. I hit the server, but it returns an "the server 
responded: You are not authorized to access this resource".

The page Xitami I'm referring that states it supports HTTP is under the 
User Authentication section

at: http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index3.htm#TOC18

Thanks for all the responses.

Regards,

Sean

Sean,

Maybe this quote from the FAQ helps...:

"
15: I get 'Not authorized to access this resource' on other URLs =20

There are a number of specific reasons why Xitami may return this:=20

  1.. The resource you are accessing is protected by a 'webmask' =

  2.. You are trying to browse a directory, but directory listings have =

COPY) on a resource which has not been authorised for this.=20
  4.. You are trying to run the WBA, but this has been disabled by the =

  5.. The URL refers to a Windows short filename when a long filename =

  6.. You're trying to do a HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation, =
and specified an absolute Content-Location: or Destination: URI which =

because the authorisation was carried-out on the request URL, and using =

  7.. A HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation failed because of an =

  Thanks for the responses. Paul is correct, I'm just trying to update a =
web page via an HTTP PUT using Netscape's Composer. My understanding is =
that this "Publish" feature I'm referring to uses an HTTP Put to update =
the html pages to servers. I hit the server, but it returns an "the =

    Xitami indeed states somewhere that they have no intention

I believe my problem is that HTTP update method on a resource which has not 
been authorized for this. I think it's authentication. I'm trying to figure 
out the correct way to configure the xitami.aut allow an HTTP put. I've 
added http-update=1 to the xitami.aut file but it's not accepting it for my 
user I configured. Maybe someone has a xitami.aut file I can see who's 
using HTTP puts to the server.

Thanks,

Sean

<b>15: I get 'Not authorized to access this resource' on other

There are a number of specific reasons why Xitami may return this: 
<ol>
<li>The resource you are accessing is protected by a 'webmask' definition
which excludes your PC. 
<li>You are trying to browse a directory, but directory listings have not
been enabled. 
<li>You are trying to use an HTTP update method (PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or
COPY) on a resource which has not been authorised for this. 
<li>You are trying to run the WBA, but this has been disabled by the
security:admin option. 
<li>The URL refers to a Windows short filename when a long filename also
exists. Xitami rejects this as being a potential security violation. You
can switch this behaviour off by setting security:safepaths to 0. 
<li>You're trying to do a HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation, and
specified an absolute Content-Location: or Destination: URI which did not
have the same path as the request URI. Xitami rejects this because the
authorisation was carried-out on the request URL, and using a different
path for the Content-Location: or Destination: URL would violate this. 
<li>A HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation failed because of an
access violation at the operating system level - for instance Xitami
tried to write to a file which was marked as read-only.

<dd>Thanks for the responses. Paul is correct, I'm just trying to update a web page via an HTTP PUT using Netscape's Composer.

Sean,

Just tried this (see below) and it works!
Despite my earlier response, you don't need a special script=20
for it at the server.

Just had the following in my .aut file:

[/]
    all=3D*
    webmask=3D*
    http-update=3D1
    http-put=3D1

Let me know if that works for you too!

Kind Regards,
Paul

    "

    15: I get 'Not authorized to access this resource' on other URLs=20

    There are a number of specific reasons why Xitami may return this:=20
      1.. The resource you are accessing is protected by a 'webmask' =
definition which excludes your PC.=20
      2.. You are trying to browse a directory, but directory listings =

      3.. You are trying to use an HTTP update method (PUT, DELETE, =

      4.. You are trying to run the WBA, but this has been disabled by =
the security:admin option.=20
      5.. The URL refers to a Windows short filename when a long =
filename also exists. Xitami rejects this as being a potential security =
violation. You can switch this behaviour off by setting =
security:safepaths to 0.=20
      6.. You're trying to do a HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY =
operation, and specified an absolute Content-Location: or Destination: =
URI which did not have the same path as the request URI. Xitami rejects =
this because the authorisation was carried-out on the request URL, and =
using a different path for the Content-Location: or Destination: URL =
would violate this.=20
      7.. A HTTP PUT, DELETE, MOVE, or COPY operation failed because of =
an access violation at the operating system level - for instance Xitami =
tried to write to a file which was marked as read-only.=20

Do you have a setting for [server] webpages in your defaults.cfg file?
In theory the bug that caused that to override every virtual host
setting has been fixed, but I'm not 100% certain the fix made it into
2.5b5.

Debug mode will probably reveal if it recognises the virtual host name
or not, and if so which directory it is trying to use.  If it recognises
the virtual host name, but goes and uses the default directory, chances
are that there's still an issue with setting [server] webpages.

Xitami will do this automatically when the CGIs take "too long" to run;
but there's no way to configure it so that, eg, 5 simultaneous
connections will cause the "try again later" type message.

You might want to reduce the [CGI] Timeout value in this situation, so
that more of the CGIs are cancelled quickly and a server overloaded
message sent.  However it's not a perfect fix because all the CGIs will
still be launched.  

You might also want to consider something like LRWP instead of CGIs, as
it's able to answer requests quicker (much much less startup overhead).

You might want to experiment with the bandwidth shaping code in the Xitami
2.5 beta.  Read up on the pipe definitions files for how to do this.
That way you can limit connections to, say, a modem-and-a-bit worth
each, or something like that.

This is 40 sockets per process.  And it's just a default setting.  You
can tell EMX to allow space for more sockets for the process at runtime
by setting an environment variable; look at the EMX documentation for
details.

Sounds very clever.  (I've never used it, but I help look after some
sites that are getting to a point where something like that would be
useful.)

>Is there anything like this available for use with Xitami on a windows

Xitami doesn't have any equivilent of Apache's mod_proxy code (to talk
to a backend server, and then pass the results back) yet.  So no,
there's nothing in there to do load balancing like that.

You could possibly run Apache at the front and Xitami at the back
though.

FWIW, I've been thinking for a while that Xitami would be quite a good
choice for some proxy/load balancing code like this.  So in the unlikely
event that I get some free time (or the slightly more likely event that
there's actually a paying client that wants it), it might get written.

/admin is administration of the _whole_server_.  It should be restricted
to people that you trust.  It's typically accessible automatically under
each domain name, by default.  But you _may_ be able to turn it off on a
domain-by-domain basis (I can't remember if the code checks this at the
right place for that to work).

Generally it'd be best not to allow anyone you don't trust running
anything they like on your server access to /admin, because with /admin
access they can set it up to let them run any program they like on your
server.

Most places I've worked configuration of the webserver (rather than just
uploading content) is restricted to a single webserver admin.  And they
double check things for security reasons, etc, before adding new setups.

Sounds a lot like some sort of race condition to me (as did the other
one that you mentioned).

If you send me the GSL script that you're using (or a simple test one
that demonstrates the problem), then I'll at least add it to our
buglist.  I can't make any promises that anyone'll have time to look at
it, but it's the sort of thing I'd like to investigate if only I had
more spare time...

The REMOTE_USER setting comes from the HTTP authentication (ie, password
protected directories); it sounds to me like you've changed from HTTP 
authentication to some other authentication (eg, the HTTPS
certificate), so the REMOTE_USER value isn't being set.  You'll probably
need to change your script so that it extracts the user from the other
authentication method.

If by DOS version you mean the Win32 command line version, then AFAIK it
should work just the same as the Win32 GUI version for LRWP.  The same
code was used to compile both of them, except that one has the GUI added
in.

I'd suggest double checking all your settings.

If you can recompile Xitami for your platform, and are willing to spare
some memory, then you can change the constant that triggers when a LRWP
response will be spooled to disk.  The relevant compile time constant is
BIG_RESPONSE_LEN in xilrwp.c; the default setting is 16384, ie 16KB.  If
you make this, say, 1048576, then up to 1MB will be held in memory.  (If
you're server is busy and sending a lot of large responses, then
obviously you'll need to have a lot of memory available.)

>How can I learn more about the way Xitami uses temporary files and generates
>temporary file names?

Unfortunately the only real documentation for this internal stuff is the
source code.  Most of it is smthttpl.c IIRC, although the main control
logic is in smthttp.c, and the thread of execution pops in and out
between the two of them.

For LRWPs the main thing to remember is that once the response is
received from the LRWP program it's basically treated like a CGI
response.  (The same is true for filter responses BTW.)

The temporary files are created in smthttpl.c in the CGI case, and
xilrwp.c in the LRWP case.

It is the browser that caches the username/password, and avoids them
having to enter it again.  The only way to "delete" something from that
cache is to fail the authentication once (send back the appropriate HTTP
response for "authentication failed; try again").

If you're doing this with a script, then you might be able to do that
based on time.

A number of sites use their own login forms, and HTTP Cookies (which can
have timeouts) for basically this reason.

You want a CGI-BIN directory.  It's going to be called "PyCGI" in the
URL, and have the appropriate directory as its on-disk location.  You'll
also need to enable index-pages-in-CGI-directory.

Something like:

[server]
  cgi-bin=E:/Sunit/XMLFiles/PyXml/Scripts
  cgi-url=/PyCGI

[cgi]
  mixed-url=1

You may also want to define some more default filenames to apply when
accessing a directory.

Actually I did find a minor difference. When you change the Base address -
say make it 8000 to move the HPPT port to 8080, the windows version seems to
still work when the LRWP address is set to 81 while the DOS verison  (using
the -b 8000 parameter set now)requires the LRWP address be set to 8081.
Think I had to use the two different addresses to get them both to work.

Take a look at this, it might do what you need:

http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html

It works at the DNS level rather than the server level.

>From the FAQ:

How do I balance load among my web servers?
I have 50 identical servers running on IP addresses
1.2.3.150, 1.2.3.151, and so on.
I'd like to spread www.heaven.af.mil requests among those servers.
Answer:
For versions 1.04 and above:
Simply put all 50 addresses into data.
tinydns will automatically return a random set of 8 addresses
for each request.
For versions 1.03 and below:
Delegate www.heaven.af.mil to
pickdns.

at least my version of the fix didn't made it into beta 5

Hello,
Im new to this list.

Would someone please direct me to a safe redirect script.

I have specified index.shtml to initiate when my page is first loaded
index.shtml contains the following line:
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/load"-->
/cgi-bin/load contains the following that starts a script from an interpreter.
#! /usr/bin/ex load.ex
but I get this output in my browser:
[xitami SSI: #exec command not permitted for security reasons;] 
I have checked Permit SSI #exec command?  

Im using Xitami v2.5b5 I also encoutered this message from
Xitami Crash Recovery Dialog
09/Apr/2002:18:11:23 -0500 Xitami v2.5b5
Abort at xixssi:33: (9, 28)

I thought I would ask before sending this message to Xitami.

Thanks very much,
Euman

Subject: [Xitami] ISAPI and Xitami
Message-ID: <033601c1e02c$5a6fe530$2b01a8c0@hc1wxp>

Hello everyone!

I'm new to the mailing list, so please bare with any "stupid" or repeated
questions I may have :-)

First question: is there an archive of this mailing list, so I can browse it
before I ask a question?

Second: I've tried using ISAPI DLLs using the ISAPI daemon provided at
www.xitami.com. The example ISAPI module ran fine (to my surprise, without
the need of installing PWS/IIS). However, running one of my own ISAPI
modules (written in Delphi 5) or PHP's ISAPI module, I get an error
indicating the ISAPI module could not be loaded with error 126. I installed
PWS and tried again just to be sure, but to no avail. Is this a known
limitation or...?

Perhaps someone could point me out to my main goal actually: I've got PHP on
the system, which is simply a filter for .PHP pages to the PHP executable.
When enabling a few PHP extension DLLs, running the executable on each
request increases the response time. So therefore I wanted to use the ISAPI
version instead, because the extension DLLs wouldn't need to be loaded with
each request. But it haven't gotten it to work like that so far :-(

FYI: My Xitami web server is running on Windows NT 4.0 Workstation with SRP6
(Rollup)

k.r. Mike

Sure...just finished 2 months of intense testing of most of the popular FTP
servers.  Here are my results:

Fastest (by far) although a bit hard to configure:
http://www.raidenftpd.com/  $13.00US standard version
Easiest to get running and very stable:  http://www.texis.com/ $30.00US
Best free server with plenty of options and easy to use:
http://www.nitrolic.com/  (free)
Longest history, stable, good options, reasonably priced:
http://www.serv-u.com  $39.95US

Actually, I think a lot of us found the FTP service in Xitami to be...well,
not so stable.  Xitami is a great web server, that's what it is and that's
what it does best...FTP is something totally different and it only makes
sense to get a real FTP server that does...well, file transfers :)

> or do you mean ftp client? in that case - i recommend ws-ftp

Up until this last release (v7) I would have agreed with you, but Ipswich
really blew it with this one.  They've tried to put to much into a stable
product just for an upgrade and ended up with a 'feature-rich' program that
is very unstable.  Within the first 45 days of its release they had 9
updates....shades of MS.  To bad too, WSFTP was a great piece of work
before.

i'm checking out the servers you posted. my ftp server doesn't get hit
much - but i've never had trouble with the xitami one. i kinda like
everything there together. i'll try the ones you posted!

i probably should have mentioned to get an older version of ws-ftp.
(jsut40fun) if you can't find one - email me and i can send one to ya.

personally i do 99% of ftp from a command prompt still. but for people that
have never done it - ws-ftp always worked well, at least the older versions
anyway...   ;-)

I don't know what you're looking for, but I would consider Xitami a good ftp
server. There is also Argo Software's FTP server, but I don't think it is as
good. You can also just look at download.com for an ftp server, but make
sure that you filter out anything that is not free.

CuteFTP or BulletProof FTP are both excellent. Have been using them for
years and nary a problem.

I can say the same for WarFTP. Though the 1.7 beta track is the latest and
greatest, I like the 1.6 track myself. 1.6 feels a bit like my BBS console
management days.

Both are stable and free.

Subject: [Xitami] Security, Counters, and CGI
Message-ID: <3CB43E53.3005.1E3572D7@localhost>


     Well I got the OS/2 version of Xitami running and have been looking for a good 
counter.  My decision came down some tight parameters.  I didn't want a "counter 
service" that could track and spam my users or web page with their logos.  I looked at 
Java and Java script.  But Java often makes browsers especially running on MS 
systems unstable.  I didn't want to enable #EXEC as I did not want the security hole. 
What I wanted something that was "simple" and self contained cgi (ie a cgi I can modify 
and put in without having to install a lot of other stuff).  Finally a cgi that would not count 
reloads.  

     To bad I was not able to find a function in Xitami to count web pages. :/  After two 
days of searching I came across graph counter.  It covered three of the 4 "hoped for" 
functions.  It was simple (needing only 2 edited lines in the cgi file), was completely self 
contained (needed no extra installed graphic handlers), and could be launched by a 
IMG link.  

     I edited and installed the cgi counter script and it counted just fine launching the 
script directly from the browser:  http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi     However 
when I place the IMG link ( IMG SCR="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?0" ) 
into the web page I get a broken link.  The CGI "IS" running when the web page is 
accessed as the count test file does go up.  It just displays a broken link for the image.  

     Any ideas as to what may cause this?  I was beginning to wonder if it was a 
configuration setting in Xitami I missed or just the script?  If you want to look at the cgi I 
am trying to use I have placed it here: http://www.furtopia.org/cgi  if anyone is curious.

Works for me. I see an image of two digits "2" and "7".

What browser?

Your URL should read:

<IMG SRC="http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?something.gif">

If it ends in a graphical suffix, that will "trick" web browsers.

Gave it a try as on my page.  But still comes up broken link.  Still not shure why this isn't 
working.

Works for me in MSIE 6.0 and in NetScape 4.7.

I am directly opening http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?0

Do you have it embedded in a public web page that we can see? It may
work different inside an IMG tag than called directly.

NS47 says "has the following structure:

     http://www.furtopia.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi?0
          Image: http://www.furtopia.org/digits/4.gif
          Image: http://www.furtopia.org/digits/7.gif "

And for the first image:

Location:  http://www.furtopia.org/digits/4.gif
 File MIME Type:  image/gif

So either you are sending a correct MIME header, or NS is making the
right guess based either on extension or the header of the actual
file.

I have been using Acount on OS/2 happily for a couple of years. You indeed invoke it as an 
image... See: http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/internet/www/cgi/acnt021.zip

Yup, that fails to show the counter in IE. NS is even more
erratic... one time I got only half the big dog, and NS was trying
to contact a server named "math..." which isn't in your HTML.

Yet if I copy the IMG link and paste it to your domain name, it
loads fine.

There seem to be a lot of BIG, FONT, and SMALL tags in the bottom
line of text. Trying to be sure they were nested correctly, I ran
out of fingers. NS is prone to go wacky if you throw too many font
attributes together. That "shouldn't" affect how it handles an IMG
tag, but... no, it does not matter. I trimmed your HTML down to one
word, no tags, and it still fails.

What language is the script? If you rename it counter.gif, it may
work better. I name my Perl scripts that return images with a GIF
extension. Xitami opens them and finds the #!/foo/bar/perl line, and
feeds them through Perl before sending them to the client.

Thanks I gave it a try but could not get it running.  Again it comes up broken link.  The 
only diffrence is Xitami is not running acount.dat at all.  It is like it doesen't want to load 
a non .cgi file.  I also could not find the .dat file the DOC was refrencing.  Could you cut-
paste your setup and how it is working?  Perhaps I am missing something?

NS is accessing a server called math???  That is really odd and a little worry some. :/

I have placed the script into http://www.furtopia.org/look  if you wish to see how it is

Ended switching to a non-beta Xitami.  I think the CGI is broken in the

I'm not a hard core user, and I just went to browse through my logs
directory and found ALOT of lines like the ones below.  Now, the likely hood
of anyone accessing my sight (archaetext.com) is very slight as I haven't
told anyone about it.

These aren't malicious attempts are they?  Perl.exe mysteriously disappeared
from my machine recently.

Am I missing a basic security setting or something?

Im no expert either but it looks like a scan and all that took place was
404 "NOT FOUND" was returned. I may be wrong, I know you can
purchase the pro-edition and its supposed to be more secure but I
would also like to see a FAQ that list the things one should look for
so that you could write a script that constantly scans your log file for
malicious intent. If I had more of this info, I would write the program to 
do this and post it for everyone to use.

Any comments?

Welcome to Code Red. Don't worry - Xitami is not vulnerable. It's just some
other infected server running an automated scan/exploit attempt.

Yeah, I got that when I first set up Xitami. I did a simple little search on
Yahoo! and this site explains everything:
http://www.securityspace.com/smysecure/w32_nmda_amm.html. Apparently, your
server was scanned by either a virus or another web site to see if it was
running the version of IIS with security risks. You should be safe using
Xitami since it sent out 404 errors.

I'm not a hard core user, and I just went to browse through my logs
directory and found ALOT of lines like the ones below.  Now, the likely hood
of anyone accessing my sight (archaetext.com) is very slight as I haven't
told anyone about it.

These aren't malicious attempts are they?  Perl.exe mysteriously disappeared
from my machine recently.

Am I missing a basic security setting or something?

Thanks,

     It is either a script to try and hack vulnerable systems or a denial of service attack on 
someone else.  If it is a denial of service attack your IP would of been picked out by a IP 
port scanner.  You and your bandwidth (as well as many others) are are now the 
unwilling participant of a denial of service attack against someone else.  

     In basic form a hacker/worm sends out a packet with a "faked" IP that makes it's way 
to your web server (notice the IP in your log is most likely the victim's IP) .  Your server 
thinking someone is trying to connect sends back a response.  The victims IP cannot 
respond so all servers used as relays sends out 4 packets to the victims IP for every 1 
faked packet they get.  Denial of service attacks are becoming more and more common 
as "kits" begin to spread and new changes are made in windows.  

     There is only two ways of stopping this that I know of (aside from fixing MS security 
flaws).  The best solution would be ISP's block non originating "faked" IP packets.  This 
would kill a mountain of abuse over night.  But it may have to get even worse before the 
major ISP's are forced to change.  The other alternative is to have your server stop 
sending to a IP for say an hour to any server that can't be contacted on initial contact or 
after 3 contacts (or whatever tries).  There may be better ways around this problem.  I 
don't know if the new Xitami can shield itself from this kind of abuse.  But it would be a 
nice feature.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami aborts on UnixWare
Message-ID: <EX-20020411-113446-0001@exchange.fiserv-missive1.fiserv.net>

Xitami aborts frequently (sometimes after a few minutes, sometimes after a few hours) on UnixWare 7.1.1.  I posted about this several months ago and Ewen suggested trying dbx on the core dumps to look at the stack, etc.  I tried this ('debug' now instead of dbx) and didn't see anything that looked useful to me.  Now I am running 2.5b5 on one port and 2.4d9 on another port (same machine), and each gets around 10000 transactions per hour.  The problem has gotten much worse as the load increased.  And often when one Xitami dies the other one dies, so I think it may be some kind of threshold in UnixWare.  But sometimes it happens at 3 a.m. when there is practically no activity at all.  All these transactions go through an LRWP processing module, with 25 copies of the module attached to each Xitami.  Below is debug info from a 2.5b5 core dump:

If this were true..you'd see a LOT more than the random occurance and those
simply aren't DOS type attacks..they're not even attacks.

There really is no way you can stop this. I have this on my server. It
happens when someone on your subnet is infected with Nimdia/Code Red (not
just servers, remember, regular users can get infected and spread it too).

This does no harm to your system, runs the amounts of hits up, but other
than that, no harm whatsoever. Don't freak out over it, you'll be fine.

The good thing is that it's only done on IP's and not domains. Weather
Xitami could shield itself, you could BAN people who do this..but then you
pose a lot of problems. All you can do is not worry about. All sysadmins get
it, we're running Xitami, it doesn't affect us.

> These aren't malicious attempts are they?

They are, and they come from within your ISP, but probably not
"from" your ISP. The IP number translates to a hostname that looks a
lot like the one you sent this email from.

 > host 24.128.72.232
232.72.128.24.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer h00c0f03820eb.ne.client2.attbi.com

 > host 24.128.19.74
 74.19.128.24.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer h00a0cc58ab25.ne.client2.attbi.com

What are they doing?

 "GET /scripts/..%c1%9c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir

This requested URL is "malformed". The dots and percents aren't
right. Xitami properly notices that, and replies 404 or 403
depending on just where it decides that this is meaningless.

However, MS IIS webserver is tricked into navigating up out of the
webpages folder, into the root, down into the windows system folder,
and runs CMD, the command processor! (Some call it the "DOS box".)

This involves two very stupid mistakes by MS IIS's programmers.
Malformed URLs should be rejected, and files outside those folder
specifically designated for web-serving should never be served. You
could say that running a program not designated for CGI delivery is
also a mistake, though MS IIS's notion of CGI is pretty elaborate,
supporting MS-proprietary extensions that basically sell MS
programming languages.

In this case, they request a DIR from CMD. On Xitami and patched
IIS, the response is "error", they ignore it. If the response is a
list of files, they struck gold. They can put more clever commands
into CMD and do almost anything to your machine.

You may wonder why they are trying IIS hacks on your Xitami server.
Well, IIS is the second most common webserver, and THE most common
inside home-ISP networks. Many folks have IIS running and don't even
know it. And it is just plain easier to try a IIS-hack on every
machine than to actually check which ones are IIS. Typically, the
script contacts -every- IP number in a given range, whether or not
there is a webserver there. If no server, it times-out. If a "good"
webserver, it ignores these silly requests. But unpatched IIS will
do the wrong thing quickly and efficiently.

This isn't a DoS attack. CMD..DIR just asks for a list of files. If
they can do that, they can ask CMD to install software that could
start flooding other machines to jam them. But that's not seen here.

You could report that IP number to your ISP. It is barely possible
that your ISP is doing it: my net-admins do a similar (but better!)
scan every month and inform anybody hosting a vulnerable machine.
More likely it is some kid reading hacker-sites and trying the most
basic hack-scripts. If the ISP cares, they will warn the account
holder and the kid may be sent to bed without supper. But there is
always another kid.

It does you no harm, except a slight increase in log-file size. When
CodeRed was popular, my logs were 10% real hits and 90% CodeRed
errors. In the peak-week, it actually was a mild problem: my slow
machine was bogged on logs, and I had to take it down for 10 minutes
and delete some monster files. CodeRed and Samba are different: they
use a VERY long request URL (thousands of characters) to overflow
IIS's request buffer and inject malicious code into IIS. Again,
Xitami handles this correctly: no overflow, just an error and huge
log files.

Odd. But not something a hacker would want to do.

Well... this is all pretty far out.  Thanks everyone for the comprehensive
responses.

2 questions then...

1) It seems that all of these requests come through with a GET request.  Is
there a way that Xitami can block any of those, as I don't expect anyone
coming to call with that as a gift.

2) everyone's responses essentially say "don't worry, you can tell by the
error code that they're not getting in" which is great, but is there another
alarm that will tip me off if someone has made it in?  Any decent resources
for info on web server security?

Thanks all,

mb

I'd recommend a good firewall like Zona Alarm (free) or Norton 
Personal firewall.  You can stealth all ports except those you use and if 
any application wants to use the network you must give it permission 
first by creating a "rule" to let it run in the future.  It's not perfect security 
but better than nothing.

   I'm using more parts of Xitami. :)  I am currently installing virtual hosts into my 
defaults.cfg file in Xitami for OS/2 2.4d7.  My server refresh is set at:

[Server]
refresh=60

However when I set the virtual hosts they do not seem to load until the server is 
restarted.  Is the refresh just for the ftpusers.aut as I was hoping to to have to shut down 
the server.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but web serverw work exclusively on GET

Using Xitami v2.5b4 in localhost mode only to debug web pages prior to
uploading to online host server.

Works fine until web page size exceeds [approx] 60k, at which time browsers
(Netscape, MSIE, etc.) do not receive entire page and, thus, do not display
correctly.  When page is uploaded to online host server and then
downloaded, all works fine.

Is there some config parameter that must be changed?

I have a 98 machine and NT4 WKS sp6a machine running Xitami.
As a service, there is no 'tray' icon. Your observations are correct.

You can read the logs for your information. There are tools to analyze
the logs.

Are you using SSI? I have had similar problems with pages that include

Can't you put a Shortcut to xitami.cpl on your desktop or in your
Launch bar? A "CPL" file is really just an EXE file.

I'm not at an Xitami machine but I can do this:

Start, Settings, Control Panel.

Right-click on Mouse (or Xitami?), an option is "Create Shortcut".
Do that, it tell you that the shortcut is created on the Desktop (I
guess it does not want ControlPanel directory cluttered).

Now find your Desktop, drag the Mouse shortcut to the LaunchBar
(normally populated with IE and Outlook). I click that and I can
twiddle my mouse's properties.

Same should work for the Xitami CPL ?

Graphics is much more likely to hang a web page, esp offsite calls 
to some tiny image or counter image.  Try eliminating graphics that 
don't load and replace one at a time.   Try using standardized fonts.  

I've never had problems with SSI ~ it's the best part of Xitami.

Here is one of the pages that won't load under Xitami v2.5b4 in localhost
mode (the only mode I use):
http://www.goldbergcoins.com/bidding/terms-bid.shtml

The Masthead, with it's graphics, is SSI'd to all other pages and those
pages load fine.  When Terms & Conditions text size is incrementally
reduced to less than [approx] 60K (total file size), the page suddenly
loads correctly.

You've got some mopping up to do, perhaps this will get you started.

Also, remember that things may not "time out" locally.  Your internet connection 
ordinarily has a set time out function so the page appears to load online when in fact 
it is just bypassing something listed above.

Well I downloaded a couple of project gutenberg books and HTMLised them 
- ~1MB files. Loads perfectly without SSI. Stops at ~30kb if its a 
.shtml and I have a <!--#include file="/filename/"--> in it.

I posted about this last september (see enclosed email) which also notes 
another SSI bug. The result of this is that I have tended to avoid SSI 
personally .

Subject: Bug: SSI Includes aren't recursive
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I just noticed that the SSI include tag (e.g. the one on the testssi 
page <!--#include file="testssi.inc"-->) cuases the rest of the 
including document (e.g. testssi.ssi) after the tag not to get delivered 
if the included document itself uses SSI as the example include does.

SSI returns just fine if the included document itself does not try any 
SSI calls.

This is true using Xitami 2.5b5 (and 2.5b4) with NS6.1, 4.7 and IE5 and 
appears to be a xitami thing in that the HTML is in fact completely 
unfinished. I'm guessing that Xixssi doesn't deal well with the same 
page requiring 2 levels of return.

Also in the process of debugging and playing I noticed that Xitami has a 
limit on files with SSI includes of about 35,000+ bytes (one file 
displayed upto the 35922nd byte, another upto the 35553rd) and any data 
thereafter is abruptly truncated. The limit is not there for pure HTML 
files - I can successfully read 1Mbyte + sized .htm files but the same 
file renamed as .SSI will be truncated around this point even if it has 
no includes.

Let this *Click* represent the lightbulb of understanding over my 
head.  

You are correct.  It certainly looks like Xitami stores the entire text 
into a single limited variable (tsk tsk).  Whoever assigned that 
variable certainly wanted to keep a very small footprint.

I misunderstood because I've been generating pages of text from 
scripts using the ssi EXEC command and not the INCLUDE 
command.  This method allows huge megabytes of sculpted text 
which can be nested in dynamic files.  I don't think there's a limit to 
the number of EXEC calls you can make in a single document.

I wonder if any server that would allow you to *include* very large 
(mb) text files would also a security risk when they slow or crash 
doing memory manipulation.  Does IIS allow larger includes?

My guess is that Xitami also prefers outside scripts and software to 
take the memory and security risks so that the server doesn't crash 
~ like the scripts many people write.

a DoS is usually a type of attack on a network to bring the
network to its knees by flooding it with useless traffic.

a DDoS (distributed denial of service attack) is something
different: in the first step, a software tries to break into
your computer to install a software which tries to replicate to
other victim computers. if there are enough infected computers,
all machines starts a DoS to a specific server.

Nimda and CodeRed are such DDoS worms who used a security leak
in the IIS for breaking in and distributing itself.

Xitami (as far as understand) there are no such leaks.

psst... as much as it pains me to say this....

I've had so many problems with Xitami and SSI that I finally gave up and
looked else where. I finally found Sambar (www.sambar.com) which is freely
distributed (without source however) and handles SSI flawlessly.  I've been
an Xitami devotee for over 30 months, but I've outgrown static pages and the
development on Xitami seems to have stalled.

Pretend that I hate you or your website.

So much, that I come over to your place with a big axe and cut your
wire, maybe axe your machine to pieces.

That's a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. I have Denied you and/or
your clients the Service that you were providing.

Of course axing-up a PC is hard work. And I don't know where you
are. And you might have a 100 pound dog sleeping in your computer
room.

So I let my computer do my dirty work.

One way is to find a back door on your machine, where I can slip in
and delete files or install my own malicious program to corrupt or
wipe your machine.

Another way to make your web service unavailable, without knowing
any backdoor on your machine, would be to run a program on my
machine that *constantly* requested pages or files from your
machine. If I do enough of that, all other users will have a very
hard time using your service.

But if I'm on dial-up modem, and you have Portal-Class servers and
connection to the network backbone, I can request all I can and you
may never even notice the silly "attack". And I've lost the use of
my own machine and connection while it is busy trying to over-load
your machine.

So hackers enlist other people's machines to help. Many Windows
machines have no passwords, and it is easy to install programs on
them. Windows often has unpatched loopholes. Also, many people will
open any darn thing they fine in their mailbox, so I send them my
malicious program and some of them will run it. If I can get 100
other machines to keep your machine busy, your machine has a very
high load and my machine isn't being used at all. And the attack
does not trace back to me.

Variations of these tricks have thrown -thousands- of "innocent"
machines against the US White House server and GRC's site. Both were
able to dodge the attack, either in advance or by a long night of
hasty network configuration. But it wasn't any fun for them.

There seem to be an endless stream of new variants of DoS attacks.
If a DNS server can be hacked, all requests for one site may end up
at some other site. My school has been getting hit at the black-box
machine that connects us to the outside world.

So there isn't any single thing to look for, to show that you may be
under DoS attack. The best hacks leave no traces. Even if your
machine does stop working, it may not be easy to know if it was an
outside attack or something wrong in the machine.

I tried both and I had an easy time with SSI on both.  Sambar 
caused me other serious problems esp on my NT ~ like quietly 
crashing on a regular basis.  If Sambar has improved lately - it 
really had to.

Otoh, Sambar has real strengths.  Ssi include statements do 
include much larger texts than Xitami.  What the limit is I have no 
idea.  And, while I don't use it much, Sambar handles ASP much 
better.  Their admin is nice.

If it didn't crash so often I'd be a real Sambar fan.

I have the same problem with large pages on 2.5b5.  I was running both 2.5b5 and 2.4d9 on different ports on our intranet.  Users found one large page (66k) that would work fine on 2.4d9 but would only partially load on 2.5b5.  I had to go back to 2.4d9 to solve the problem.  There are no graphics or SSI on the page, but it is built by LRWP.

Hi,

Attached Perl script does not run properly on the Xitami webserver version
2.4d9 running on my Win98SE machine. It is a widely used script which is
part of LiveCounter classic. When triggering the script the following way:
http://www.familie-egberts.tk/cgi-bin/livecnt1.pl?v it should print some
version information (however, it does more than that!) but the browser
(IE5.5) stops responding for a while and then returns a blank screen.

No CGI (compilation) errors are reported. The pipexxxx.cgi file is empty and
the .cgo file only contains the content_type line. I'm lost, please help.

Thanks,
Egbert

No.

However it should be relatively trivial to parse either <STDIN> or 
$ENV{'QUERY_STRING'} to create a suitable array. The problem is that the 
output of a program that uses a CLI fo its arguments is unlikely to 
suitable for display on a webserver as it won't generate HTML. What you 
probably need to do is create a wrapper progrm (using for example the 
CGI.pm library) that you can then wrap around all these scripts.

Hi,

Perhaps this is leftover paranoia from the 'hack attacks' i got such great
response on last week, but there's some weirdness that's going on:

1) I'm getting alot of "Server Overloaded" errors when there is no apparant
traffic to my server.

2) Sometimes "Connections" do not drop, and X seems to freeze.  This <seems>
to happen most when I'm accessing perl scripts through a WML page, but I'm
not sure... usually I notice it later in the day on the same day I've used
that shortandsimplescript.

3) Set X to "Turbo!" last night... would that make a difference?

4) Should I reduce the time Xitami keeps a connection open?  it's set to 30
seconds now.

!5) Server logs have stopped being generated, though X config is still set
up for them... last one I have is from 4/15/02 which logs activity on 4/14.

thanks, I appreicate the wisdom you all share so willingly. :B)

Thanks for your reactiom.

As far as I know, the values of the command line get in Perl assigned to an
array called @ARGV. It is a library function as far as I understand. I am a
newbee to Perl so I may be missing something.

The most sophisticated type of attack is a Smurf DoS.  To Smurf is to change
the source IP address of every out going packet and then hit someones server
with hundreds or thousands of packets per second.    When someone is
Smurfing you, its nearly impossible to track them down because every packet
has a false source address, and each false address is different from the
previous one.  The most common form of a Smurf DoS is a "Syn" attack.

A "syn" is a tcp packet one computer sends to another to initiate a
communication of some sort, the recipient computer gets the "syn", checks
the source address of that syn and then responds with an "ack" (ack =
acknowledgement), completing the handshake and then both computers start
talking and listening to each other.  However, years ago, most computers
only had a buffer to handle up to, maybe, 200 "syn"s per second.  So,
hackers would Smurf hundreds of "syn"s to a server.  The server would get so
busy handling false "syn"s that it would never really have enough time to
handle real requests - thus, effectively shutting down the server or more
importantly, it gets denied the ability to communicate its services.

In recent years, patches and software developers increased the buffer size
that handled the syns into the thousands, and then they started creating
individual buffers for specific sockets on servers.  Typical services that
always needed to be running were ports: 23, 25, 69, 80, 110 (probably a few
others) - those ports received their own buffers that could handle thousands
per second while all other ports shared the one main buffer.

And to be honest, I don't know what has been done over the last year or two
to combat SYN attacks.  I do know though, years ago, the Principal Engineer
for MCI wrote a program that used the OSPF Spanning tree algorithm to
back-track smurf attacks.  But it only worked on an ATM backbone because ATM
has the ability, at Layer 2, to check sourcing of incoming packets via PVCs.
The program would start at the Victims router and then login into every
router that connected directly to that one router.  The program would find
the next router traffic was coming through, then login to that router and
perform the same process until eventually, the program reached the source
router.  The source router could be a edge router talking to another
backbone (like Sprint, UUNET, BBN Planet, ANS, etc) or the source router
could be a router that connected to a smaller downstream Tier 2 provider
(regional ISPs) OR the router could be a directly connected customer.  The
only power MCI had was over its directly connected customers and then they
would shut down that customers link until that customer found who the
internal user was that was responsible for the attack.

Anyway, as you read in earlier responses to this thread, there are all new
kinds of DoS attacks these days.  The key to avoid being attacked is: don't
piss anyone off, don't be a mega company with mega dollars, never claim your
site is hack-proof free, don't try to impress the world, don't release
shitty software - oh yeah, and don't have any computers on the internet.

Set [CGI] passargs=1.  It's set to 0 by default, because there are
security risks in passing anything that comes in the query string on the
command line (eg, on some OS certain arguments can be used to run
another command).  Xitami tries to defend against some of the more
obvious ones, but by no means are we certain that it's secure.

If you don't want to set that option, I'd suggest either a wrapper
program to pull query string apart, check the arguments, and then run
the other program; or use a different CGI script that parses
QUERY_STRING as per the CGI spec.

Hi,

Attached Perl script does not run properly on the Xitami webserver version
2.4d9 running on my Win98SE machine. It is a widely used script which is
part of LiveCounter classic. When triggering the script the following way:
http://www.familie-egberts.tk/cgi-bin/livecnt1.pl?v it should print some
version information (however, it does more than that!) but the browser
(IE5.5) stops responding for a while and then returns a blank screen.

No CGI (compilation) errors are reported. The pipexxxx.cgi file is empty and
the .cgo file only contains the content_type line. I'm lost, please help.

Thanks,
Egbert

Message-ID: <01c001c1e650$95c173e0$0200a8c0@mine2>

Xitami 2.4d9 is running on a dedicated freshly reinstalled W2K system.
After about 2 days it suddenly vanished (crashed) without a trace.
The logfile showed the following last two entries:

212.129.132.249 - - [17/Apr/2002:19:57:38 +0100] "GET /marcel/vistasu3.exe
HTTP/1.1" 200 886734
212.129.132.249 - - [17/Apr/2002:19:58:29 +0100] "GET /marcel/vistasu3.exe
HTTP/1.1" 200 886734

I could easily restart it.
Could the double GET perhaps explain the crash?
Would I have more luck (stability) with 2.5b5 which I abandoned because XML
is/was not handled naturally?

Thanks
Jan de Lint

P.S. I'd like to apologize for any inconvenience my rather blunt out of
office message may have caused about two weeks ago. It won't happen again.

.xml files in the default Xitami 2.5b5 configuration are handled by GSL
scripts.  If you don't want this, you can edit the xitami.cfg file, and
remove the [Wsx] .xml mapping.  (Unfortunately you can't override it in
the defaults.cfg file.)

As for stability issues, 2.4d9 is more likely to be stable than the
2.5b5 beta.  However both do have issues with "dying" from time to time,
unfortunately.

If anyone finds a repeatable pattern to the dying (eg, do this, and then
it dies, every time I do that) then please let us know.  Unfortunately
"it just died" isn't very useful for trying to figure out what is causing
the problem.

When responding to this thread, please respond to the list, since I, too, 
am having frequent Xi crashing.  We are running Xitami Pro v2.4d10 
though.

In lieu of an explanation, if someone can guide me to a way I can create 
a simple service listener, I could deal with option.  In other words, a little 
app that listens to Xitami, checking to see if it is still running, and, if not, 
restarts it.  Sounds easy enough.... and those are generally the kind of 
apps that take the longest to develop, eh?!?!?

I've been having a problem with it disappearing almost daily.  When I get up
in the morning if I move the curser near the X icon, it just goes away.
I'll dig into it and try to figure out why. I've simply been "dealing" with
it a couple of weeks.  I haven't even fixed the problem of having to go to
the control panel and stopping Xitami then restarting it every time I reboot
(not very often) since I reloaded X a few months ago.

I'll try to get more info, I'll pin a note to my shirt.

You don't want to "listen" to Xitami; you want to "check up" on Xitami.
What I do with some servers I monitor is have a special test URL (eg, a
HTML page with some recognisable text on it), and then have a small perl
program (eg, using LWP) check that URL from time to time.  If it doesn't
get the "right" response, then it restarts Xitami (or whatever is being
monitored).

we have something like that. we just send request to specific ports and see
if a response come back (try telneting to port 25 of a mail server or port
80 of a web server). we do this for business purposes..... but i've added my
own to test my web / mail / camera servers at home  ;-)

as for restarting the apps - that's another application. our stuff is
complex enough that it needs to be researched and fixed by a person. but a
web or mail server should be pretty simple to restart. i have a batch job
running every night for backups. i also restarts mail servers, dns, etc.

any errors are sent to email or pagers.

simple testing isn't that difficult to develop. ewen's post is another good
example of a way to do this.

Or you start it from a simple script that runs 'forever'. On OS/2 it looks like: 

[runxitami.cmd]

/* */
Do Forever
'Xitami.exe'
end
exit

Couldn't be much simpler. And reactivates instantly ;-)

Ewen,
thanks for your reaction, it indeed solved this issue!

When the particular script runs, it should however produce a simple text in
the browser but a download action is initiated in stead. The actual outcome
is what I expect.

The pipexxxx.cgo file lookes like this:

	Content-type: text/plain
	Pragma: no-cache
	Cache-control: no-cache
	Expires: Mon, 28 Apr 1997 00:01:00 -0500

	c0=42
	vr=99AX

I have seen it working correctly but apparently I have changed something in
the configuration but I don't know what!
And I hope you can help me out again.

Thanks

I was able to get Virtual Hosts working with Xitami 2.4d9 production
release.

Since I have upgraded to Xitami 2.5b5 beta release, I have been unable to
get Virtual Hosts working.

Let me know which version you have and I might be able to help you out
further.

It's a pretty straight forward process:
    Register the Domain with a registrar to be used as the Vhost DNS name
    Give the Vhost a name
    Type in your Vhost DNS name
    Point to the dir where the files are
    Click Create
    Then go into the Vhost configuration to tweak the settings, such as the
default html page, error logs, security, etc.
    Restart Xitami
    Should work

well, i was able to get 2 more ip addresses from my isp so i have 4 ip addresses now...

127.0.0.1 (everyone has)
24.65.162.(35 to 37)

i was able to get the v hosting to work using diferent ip addresses, but i still can't get them to work with domain names.

I am using version 2.4d9

I registered all 3 names with a registrar.
typed www.domainname.com into the dns part of the virtual host wizard... didn't work.

  I was able to get Virtual Hosts working with Xitami 2.4d9 production release.

  Since I have upgraded to Xitami 2.5b5 beta release, I have been unable to get Virtual Hosts working.

  Let me know which version you have and I might be able to help you out further.

  It's a pretty straight forward process:
      Register the Domain with a registrar to be used as the Vhost DNS name
      Give the Vhost a name
      Type in your Vhost DNS name
      Point to the dir where the files are
      Click Create
      Then go into the Vhost configuration to tweak the settings, such as the default html page, error logs, security, etc.
      Restart Xitami
      Should work

Guess what. It's won't start automatically.  If NT boots up, there is
no default 'account'. So Xitami won't run until you log into the console.

Check out www.basta.com. Look at "AppToService"

you can modify the registry on winnt and w2k to automatically log a user in
on bootup.

i currently do this on my home w2k server box that runs my home web server.
for obvious security reasons it's not a great idea in some environments...
but for home use it's fine.

here are instructions if you want to do this...

To me, it sounds like you're allowing anonymous ftp connections. You can =
set up ftp users in ftpusers.aut, or by pressing Define... next to User =
configuration file under FTP. Web Browsers by default try anonymous ftp =

I have setup a small Perl script containing some simple print statements for
testing purposes. When I execute the script, the browser prompts to download
a file. This file contains the expected output but I want it to be printed
in the browser!. Which Xitami configuration parameter (if any) controls this
output behavior?

Thanks,
Egbert

Do you have the content-type line in your header? I know Xitami doesn't =
require it, but it couldn't hurt. Just put one of the lines into your =
script if you don't have it:
print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
print "Content-Type: text/plain\n\n";

Is the script in your CGI-BIN directory?  Does it start with #! /usr/bin/perl
or similar?

Only "executable looking" scripts in your cgi-bin directory will be
executed; the rest will be offered to the browser "as is".

Xitami is setup to handle Perl scripts and it does excecute the script. The
issue is that the outcome does not appear in the browser window but in a
file which I have to download. The contents of that file contains the
expected results.

Only "executable looking" scripts in your cgi-bin directory will be
executed; the rest will be offered to the browser "as is".

The PHP variable $PHP_SELF seems to be blank, I am using PHP 4.1.2 and 
Xitami 2.4d9 which are both the latest version.  Has anyone else had this 
problem and do they know how to fix it?

Subject: [Xitami] VHosts
Message-ID: <3CC1A58C.3010508@ultinet.org>

I found the message below in the archives.

I am running the NT service version of the latest (2.5b5) beta. I 
reeeeeeealy want to run domain-based vhosts, but I can't. Must I 
downgrade to the production release? Is there a patch for the NT service 
version anywhere?

I'm pretty sure I have everything configured, the request log shows the 
correct domain, all the CFGs are loaded... But nothing. Always gives me 
the default domain.

Help....

Then make sure you output a Content-Type: header that is one that the
browser will understand is to be displayed.  text/html or text/plain are
common ones to use.  Otherwise the _browser_ will decide it needs to
save the file.

Ben,
I've had this problem before and brought it up on this list also.  For some reason
that variable won't work with Xitami.  Try $SCRIPT_NAME.  It does the same thing. 
It worked for me.

The Content-type was set to text/plain.

Thanks anyway!

This flaw has caused me so much (beginners) frustation. But now I am a

I've been going through the code, but it's been way too long since I've done

Well, after adding tons of debug statements, I finally tracked down the bug.

Here's the info, for those of you that are able to compile the source.

In file "src\smt\smthttp.c", in the function vhost_new(), around line 546
the if logic below is reversed.

orig code:

    /*  Determine rootdir and cgidir for virtual host
*/
    /*  If command-line option is not the default, it takes precedence
*/
    if (streq (rootdir, DEFAULT ("server:webpages")))
        v_rootdir = VCONFIG ("server:webpages");
    else
        v_rootdir = rootdir;

fixed code:

    /*  Determine rootdir and cgidir for virtual host
*/
    /*  If command-line option is not the default, it takes precedence
*/
    if (!streq (rootdir, DEFAULT ("server:webpages")))
        v_rootdir = VCONFIG ("server:webpages");
    else
        v_rootdir = rootdir;

alternate fix:

    /*  Determine rootdir and cgidir for virtual host
*/
    /*  If command-line option is not the default, it takes precedence
*/
    if (streq (rootdir, DEFAULT ("server:webpages")))

Hi
I am trying to set up Xitami to work with one of my (Cognos) applications.
Here is the instructions that I have:


You must also ensure that you have the correct virtual directories set up. 
If you installed
  The table below lists the aliases for the directories and the folders to 
which the aliases must map.
Alias                    Directory 
Permissions
/cognos                 \Cognos\cer1\WebContent                  read
/cognos/cgi-bin       \Cognos\cer1\cgi-bin                           execute



How do I set up these aliases?

i set up my dns server so that cwk.brogandesign.com points to www.cookingwithkevin.com

When I go to cwk.brogandesign.com I get the brogandesign.com index file, however, if i type in the index file manually, as in cwk.brogandesign.com/index.htm, then I get the correct index file.

Whenever I don't specify the index file, I get the wrong one...

for example, right now, i need to define two virtual hosts. one for http://mydomain.com and another for http://www.mydomain.com

It it possible to instead, define a virtual host as http://*.mydomain.com?

Do I need to input a differnt char?

No, there's no wildcard mechanism (other than making it he default
host).  You can, however, point multiple domain names at the same
virtual host config file, eg.

[Virtual-Hosts]
  mydomain.com=mydomain.cfg
  www.mydomain.com=mydomain.cfg

which can save some time in setting things up.

Aliases is on the menu for the web browser admin screen. Just click Configuration and then on Aliases, which is on the right side.
Alias goes to Alias and Directory goes to Points to path. You should already have read access. To setup execute, just point the
cgi-bin to your alias or higher, like your web page directory.

Hi
I am trying to set up Xitami to work with one of my (Cognos) applications.
Here is the instructions that I have:


You must also ensure that you have the correct virtual directories set up.
If you installed
  The table below lists the aliases for the directories and the folders to
which the aliases must map.
Alias                    Directory
Permissions
/cognos                 \Cognos\cer1\WebContent                  read
/cognos/cgi-bin       \Cognos\cer1\cgi-bin                           execute



How do I set up these aliases?

Hello,

  I've tried just about every version of PHP after 4.0.2 with several different versions of Xitami (including the latest) on win95/98/2000 and they all have the same problem.  $PHP_SELF is set, but empty!

  The same versions of the PHP4 binaries work fine under IIS, both as CGI and ISAPI filter.  For now I'm back to 4.0.2, but I'd really like to upgrade and keep my Xitami!

Anyone come across this before?

John,
This was discussed only a couple of days ago.  Search back through the archives and
check it out.  I've found that the variable $SCRIPT_NAME works just the same.  Give
that a try.

Hi Shane,

  Thanks for the pointer.  I was hoping more for a solution, or some idea how this could be fixed.  I have *alot* of code using $PHP_SELF, on many different production servers.  This would be a major pain to track down and change.

  Anyone have any experience using ISAPI with the php4isapi.dll, and does this problem then go away?  $PHP_SELF still works with 4.0.2, which is what I am still running locally for development.  Strange.

Thanks,
  John

John,
I've also found this to be a pain to change code.  I didn't investigate the matter
too much, but found this as my only solution.  There may be other solutions someone
else is willing to provide (hopefully), but it doesn't look too promising.

Don't change the code.

Make a BAT file called PHP-fix.BAT

 @echo off
 set  $PHP_SELF=$SCRIPT_NAME
 c:\php\bin\php.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5

(I may have screwed-up the syntax, but you'll figure it out.)

Tell Xitami to send PHP file to PHP-fix.BAT

Subject: [Xitami] Yet Another VH Problem
Message-ID: <007701c1eb04$d6418820$a419bb92@ewu.edu>

I am running a student webserver under Xitami v2.5b4 on an old Win95 box.
Works fine.

Recently, I tried setting up virtual hosts (using the wizard, mostly) for
different teams, and trying to give each team their own logs, so they can
see what their errors look like.  Xitami created the logs for me
(teamXX.log, teamXXerr.log), and in the correct directory.  However, none of
the logs has any entries -- all the information is going into the default
logs under C:\Xitami.  This seems to be because Xitami is ignoring the VH
entries and using the defaults.  Here are the contents of defaults.cfg, a
team config file, and an extract from debug.

In defaults.cfg I have:
[Virtual-hosts]
    Eaglebay.ewu.edu/teamXX = "teamXX.cfg"
----------------------------------------------
In teamXX.cfg I have:
#*END

[Accesslog]
    Filename = "C:/Xitami/webpages/teamXX/logs/teamXX.log"
    enabled=1

[Errorlog]
    Filename = "C:/Xitami/webpages/teamXX/logs/teamXXErr.log"

    Webpages = "C:/Xitami/webpages/teamXX"
    Hostname="eaglebay.ewu.edu"
----------------------------------------------
In debug I see:
2002/04/23 13:12:06: Looking for VH using Host value: eaglebay.ewu.edu

So, any obvious errors? Any recommendations?

Subject: [Xitami] log file renaming denied
Message-ID: <DAECIFPNFLGIHMJEOGHMEEMBCBAA.spantazi@uvic.ca>

Hi,

I have had this problem a long time ago, while running Xitami application
(not the service) on NT4.
After switching to the Xitami service 2.4d9 everything worked fine.
Recently I upgraded to Xitami Pro 2.4d10 and experience a few snags.
One of them is that the logs do not get renamed in the log folder and I get
in the xitami.log an error like this

2/04/23  0:00:12: Could not rename 'logs\access.log' to 'logs\ac020423.log'
2/04/23  0:00:12: Permission denied

I've noticed that the configuration files of Xitami Pro 2.4d10, although I
believed at least updated to 2.4d9, they were not. For example, there were
no LRWP 2.0 protocol entries. Also I noticed that the help HTML files were
just copied from 2.4d7 without even changing the version number. Not very
nice for a product that is not free anymore, but anyway, other than this I
am happy with the overall functionality.

I believe there might be some setting that I missed and I wonder if anybody
else ran into this and solved it.

Thanks,

Stefan

For some reason it is not matching your virtual hosts -- and hence is
returning the "default" webpages, and hence logging in the default logs.

You'll need to make sure that the defaults.cfg file points at your
virtual hosts with entries like:

[virtual-host]
  domainname=config

and also that the domain name is being passed in with a HTTP/1.1 Host:
header (which it appears to be from the snippet that you list).

i occasionally have had the same problem. i run about 4 xitami servers and
have seen it on 2 of them. both were corrected when i had to reinstall the
machines.... so i never found a fix. the log file never gets created - so
you get that error everyday and eventually have a very long log file. it
just starts happening one day out of the blue. if you shut down xitami, you
can manually rename the log file and a new one will be created when you
restart xitami. but you will continue to get the same error.

if anyone knows how to fix this....

(ps - i'm currently running versions 2.4d6 and 2.4d9)

Xitami protects its logs from being used from other programs, just like using flock in perl. I think what's happening is that it's
not unprotecting them before it renames them. This could possibly be a bug. You could try having it append to another file or move
it instead of renaming it.

Hi,

I have had this problem a long time ago, while running Xitami application
(not the service) on NT4.
After switching to the Xitami service 2.4d9 everything worked fine.
Recently I upgraded to Xitami Pro 2.4d10 and experience a few snags.
One of them is that the logs do not get renamed in the log folder and I get
in the xitami.log an error like this

2/04/23  0:00:12: Could not rename 'logs\access.log' to 'logs\ac020423.log'
2/04/23  0:00:12: Permission denied

I've noticed that the configuration files of Xitami Pro 2.4d10, although I
believed at least updated to 2.4d9, they were not. For example, there were
no LRWP 2.0 protocol entries. Also I noticed that the help HTML files were
just copied from 2.4d7 without even changing the version number. Not very
nice for a product that is not free anymore, but anyway, other than this I
am happy with the overall functionality.

I believe there might be some setting that I missed and I wonder if anybody
else ran into this and solved it.

Thanks,

Stefan

Question on Attachments to E-mail:

 

Used Net::SMTP from ActiveState to set up sub to send mail.
This 
subroutine works correctly, but doesn't provide for
file attachments. Listed 
SMTP.pm and found entry points
for mail, to, data, and quit, but none for 
attach.

 

Do I need to use another module or can Net::SMTP be 
used?
 
Also, is there a module available for faxing files?

 

Listed below is the sub I'm using.

 

sub send_mail
{ my ($to, $from, $subject, @body, $attach)=@_;
  
use Net::SMTP;

 

  my $relay = "smtp.earthlink.net";
  my $smtp  = 
Net::SMTP- new($relay);
  die "Open of mail failed" if (! defined 
$smtp);
  print "Open of mail OK", " BR ";

 

  print "Mail beg", " BR ";
  
$smtp- mail($from);
  $smtp- to($to);
  
$smtp- data();
  $smtp- datasend("To: $to\n");
  
$smtp- datasend("From: $from\n");
  $smtp- datasend("Subject: 
$subject\n");
  $smtp- datasend("\n");
  
foreach(@body)
  {
    
$smtp- datasend("$_\n");
  }
  
$smtp- dataend("\n");
  $smtp- quit;
}

I created a simple perl script that would allow me to stream real player files using the free player. The script is:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

$forminfo = $ENV{'QUERY_STRING'};
$forminfo =~ s/%([0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F])/pack("C", hex($1))/eg;

print "Content-type: application/vnd.rn-realmedia\n\n";
print "$forminfo\n";

You could also use the object tag in HTML and put it into a web page that way. If you could get me more information on specifically
what type of video file it is and if you want to display it in a different program or on a web page, I'd be able to help you more.

I found this at http://www-old.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/libwww-perl/archive/1999h1/0053.html. The message is below:

You might want to check out MIME::Entity and company, specifically, the
build, attach, print, and stringify methods.

For example (from MIME::Entity documentation):

my $msg = MIME::Entity->build(
 From     => 'me@myhost.com',
 To       => 'you@yourhost.com',
 Subject  => "Hello, nurse!",
 Data     => [
  'body text line 1',
  'body text line 2',
  'body text line 3'
 ]
);
$msg->attach(
 Path => $my_file_to_attach,
 Type => $my_files_mime_type,
 Encoding => '-SUGGEST'
);
# set up SMTP recipient, sender here
$smtp->datasend($msg->stringify);

# or possibly $msg->print $smtp (I haven't tried this)

So you just use $smtp->datasend once in this case instead of multiple times. Since you have mutliple lines of data, you should be
able to use Data => @body. Hope that works.

Hi,

If you are going to stream QuickTime videos there is a free, open source
streaming server called Darwin available on Apple
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/qtss/
I remember that it needs a perl engine to run at the same time but other
than this, the only thing you need to worry is your streaming server
bandwidth. I think you don't even need xitami to run the streaming server,
it can be a totally separate, machine. Of course you need a webserver to
store the webpages with the streaming links or embeds.

Good luck
Stefan

No, but you should be able to change the content type to an mpeg file and it should work. I haven't tested it, though.

Message-ID: <001101c1ecbf$d7d73b00$0200a8c0@GregoryHart>

I quickly tested it and this should work:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

$forminfo = $ENV{'QUERY_STRING'};
$forminfo =~ s/%([0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F])/pack("C", hex($1))/eg;

print "Content-type: audio/mpeg\n\n";
print "$forminfo\n";

Just call the script like this: script.pl?http://www.domain.com/audio_file.mp3. If you want a video file, just change the content
type to video/mpeg.

We were just wondering about this very subject today.   Do you
have a script that streams mpeg files?

If you don't have perl, and you have a file, for example, video.mpv, you could create another file, stream.mpv, and put
http://www.domain.com/video.mpv in it. This is basically what the perl script does. The video.mpv is the file that you want to
steam. When someone clicks on stream.mpv, Xitami automatically sends the content type, video/mpeg, and when the media player opens,
it looks at http://www.domain.com/video.mpv and redirects to that file. Hope this helps for those without perl.

Subject: [Xitami] Missing Images in Xitami 2.5b5 ?
Message-ID: <000701c1ee3a$0e47e0b0$020316ac@localhost>

I am running 2.5 b5 on a Win platform and noticed that images for
directories (dir_dir.gif, dir_any.gif, etc.) are not in the images
directory.  The template httpdir.gsl seems to indicate the images should be
there, yet they are not.  Am I missing something?

Thank you,

It depends on what you mean by a whole lot of sites. If you are just =
using one configuration, but you want many directories that you want to =
have cgi access, you just put the cgi-bin directory to your webpage =
directory. If you have virtual hosts, instead of clicking on =
configuration, you need to click on virtual hosts, then on the =
configuration that you want to change, and then you can change the =
cgi-bin directory. If you mean something different, just email me. Hope =
that helps!

Greg, many thanks. In the webpage directory, I have a whole lot of =
folders with a web site in each folder. In the cgi-bin, I have the same =
named folders with their respective named folders which have the cgi =
file. I simply want to put that cgi-bin folder (which contains the cgi =
file) into the website folder. It would simplify everything for me as it =
would all be in the same place. For your information, I am using xitami =
just to test my scripts before loading my stuff onto the net.... but I'm =
really new at this. from what you say below, do I just put a folder =
called cgi-bin into the website folder itself? Up until now, I have kept =
them separate because I know it works and I don't want ot mess up =
xitami, by playing around with it. however, I seem to be building up =
folders and it is fiddly the way it is right now.

  It depends on what you mean by a whole lot of sites. If you are just =
using one configuration, but you want many directories that you want to =
have cgi access, you just put the cgi-bin directory to your webpage =
directory. If you have virtual hosts, instead of clicking on =
configuration, you need to click on virtual hosts, then on the =
configuration that you want to change, and then you can change the =
cgi-bin directory. If you mean something different, just email me. Hope =
that helps!

Gary,

Download the source release package for 2.5b5.  Unzip it to a temp folder,
you'll find the missing images in the webpages/images dir of the Zip file.

I am running 2.5 b5 on a Win platform and noticed that images for
directories (dir_dir.gif, dir_any.gif, etc.) are not in the images
directory.  The template httpdir.gsl seems to indicate the images should be
there, yet they are not.  Am I missing something?

Thank you,

Thanks.  They were there.  It seems that these should be included in the

Just go into the 'Configuration' menu from http://localhost/admin, and =
then it should show a page with many text boxes. The first three are the =
ones that you want to focus on. The first one called 'Main HTML =
directory' is your webpage directory. Change the one called 'Main CGI =
directory' to the 'Main HTML directory'. Next, change the 'CGI URLs =
start with' to /. Finally, press Save at the top left and you'll be =
brought to the main menu. The last step is to press Restart in the top =
right corner. It should say 'Server is restarting...' and then you can =
start using your cgi files in your webpage directory, or any sub-folders =
in it, once you see that message.

If it still doesn't work, try right-clicking on Xitami and press =
terminate. Then you need to start Xitami again.

I hope that works for you! Email me again if still have problems.

Hello everybody,

I wanted to know when a new release of Xitami is due.. A new beta, that 
is - where Virtual Hosts should work...

I use the latest beta and they don't work, as we all know..

Does anyone here have a clue?

Thanks!

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami2.4d9 and PHP4
Message-ID: <3CCC8F85.92421180@astcomm.net>

I tested Xitami for about a year and a half, then finally gave up on it and
went back to Apache.  I'm back testing it again, trying to run a php4 driven
MySQL database application to see if it will reduce CPU/memory load over
what Apache uses.  The server is running on a twin Pentium-Pro, powered by
Debian Linux/2.2.19 kernel, and 512MB RAM.  Apache version is 1.3.24 with
PHP4.4.1 as loadable module for Apache, and using the php4-mysql module to
drive the database.  All applications installed with Debian debs from the
woody distro.

Question:
Can Xitami be used with the PHP module for Apache, or do I have to compile a
seperate PHP app on the server?  If I need the seperate PHP app, I'll
compile it and drop it in.

Question:
It's been awhile, but if I remember correctly, to enable parsing of PHP you
have to add a line for a filter like: .php=/path/to/php4/executable ???

Other observations:
* Xitami *still* doesn't write a PID file on UNIX platforms.  This was one
of my pet peeves with the previous versions as well - it'd be nice to be
able to run Xitami from init.d or tcpserver on UNIX hosts instead of having
to use killall to stop the process and a script to start it when
configurations are changed or virtual domains added or removed.

* The FTP server still won't handle hardly any load at all - I've found I
can't use it for serious FTP work.

* The webbased admin panel still positively rocks - much easier than editing
Apache's config file via ssh, and then reloading the server with
/etc/init.d/apache reload.  But I can't get Xitami's server restart function
to work every time when throwing in a new domain or making other config
changes that require reload of the /usr/local/bin/xitami/defaults.cfg file. 
I've found I still have to ssh to the box, kill xitami, then execute the
start script to fire it back up and force the config file reload.  Others
have this problem?

I answered most of my own questions <g>.

I had to compile php4 --with-mysql to work with Xitami and this application
- the php4 module for apache wouldn't work.  The results are somewhat
disappointing.

This was a good time of the evening to test Xitami, as the server is running
under a fairly heavy load.  This is an online message board application
hosted for the GWTA.  This server is running at a constant load of about
11,500 hits per hour this time of the evening.  This would be no problem
with static pages, but this is a totally dynamic php4/mysql database
application which greatly increases CPU and memory load due to parsing
scripts and database calls - the database server is running on the same
machine.

Monitoring processes and performance, using top, shows apache using
approximately 67% of the total memory (both physical and swap) and the CPU's
running an average of 17-21% idle.  Apache isn't using all the CPU power -
quite a bit of it is being used by the mysql daemons, which fork like
apache.  Running 'ps -ef|grep apache' shows an average of 190-200 seperate
httpd processes fairly continuous.  This varies between peaks and valleys of
load, as some of the server processes die off when load goes down, and
apache spawns new ones as load increases.

Xitami is different.  It can handle this application until a peak in the
demand hits.  When load peaks, Xitami requires increasing memory to spawn
new threads, but not as much as apache.  Apache is fairly constantly
requiring 350-400 MB of memory.  The CPU power is another matter.  Xitami is
using it all, and the server slows to a dead crawl when the load peaks.  The
only explanation I can come up with is that the parsing of the php scripting
is not quite as efficient as the way apache is doing it.

Is there a way to optomize php for Xitami?  Or a loadable module similar to
apache's?  Xitami isn't listed in the documentation for the current release
of PHP4.

There's no loadable module for PHP for Xitami; in fact as far as I
recall the loadable module is only for Apache, and PHP was originally
written to run only with Apache.  A couple of years back I ran into one
of the authors of PHP at a conference, and we spoke briefly about the
idea of better integration between Xitami and PHP but no one has really
had time investigate it much further.

In the case of PHP and Xitami, the real killer under load is that PHP is 
being run as a CGI (a filter in Xitami is basically a CGI process in
disguise).  The overhead of forking and starting up the CGI process, and
dragging the output back in from the output files gets pretty noticable
when things get busy.  Apache/mod-php avoids all that overhead.

The obvious half way house is to turn PHP into a LRWP process attached
to Xitami, an idea that we played around with briefly some time ago but
never quite got completed.  If someone (who knows how to write C code)
is interested in playing with this idea let me know, and I'll try to
find the source code we'd thrown together.

>From your other message:
>* Xitami *still* doesn't write a PID file on UNIX platforms.  

I actually suspect that it's still the same version of Xitami as you
last noted this problem with.  We haven't noticed the source growing
new functions all by itself... :-)  (Yes, alas, the release versions of
Xitami have hardly changed in two years :-(  Even our internal versions
have changed all that much, although some of the libraries have.)

Contributions of source code to write a PID file much appreciated.  (I'd
find it handy too...)

>* The FTP server still won't handle hardly any load at all - I've found

This has been fairly widely noted.  We do recommend using another FTP
server if you're doing all that much with FTP.  The one in Xitami is
basically a very lightweight one for when you don't have/want to install
another.  I'd like to make it more robust myself, but simply haven't had
the time.

A number of people have noted this too.  I suspect there's just not 
quite enough checking of all the files going on.  But it's another
thing that we haven't been able to make enough time to investigate.

I previously e-mailed this list about a problem with 50 simultaneous
connections to CGI scripts under Xitami.  I have since performed additional
testing and have come to the conclusion that CGIs are a fatal source of
DoS/DDoS attacks with the Xitami webserver under Windows (others have
complained about Xitami slowing to a crawl under Linux).  Below are the
steps that I took to come to this conclusion:

1)  I fixed my localhost Distributed Attack Server/Client (DAS/DAC) so that
it didn't crash (really silly problem dealing with attempting to allocate
and write to the same area of memory at the same time).

2)  I fixed many of XiFusion's bugs that people have mentioned since the
release of v2.5.

3)  I re-ran the DAS/DAC.  The same problems arose as before in the logs.
Just a refresher, the log files look like this under a 60 user load:

Obviously, a very serious problem is occurring here.  Sometimes I am
getting zero bytes returned, one byte returned, and the rest of the time
the correct number of bytes returned.

At this point, I whipped out my compiler, Borland's C RTL, and downloaded
the latest stable Xitami source.

4)  Next, I wrote my own function that calls CreateProcess and
WaitForSingleObject to see if either function fails within XiFusion.  The
same problems arose and neither function failed.

5)  I created a file for every single thread started in the DAC to track
exactly what happens with each thread.  The DAC stopped opening files after
47 files were opened.  The problem:  The number of open files had been
exceeded for the application.

Obviously, I only hit a C library limitation, but it dawned on me that
since CreateProcess was not failing and WaitForSingleObject was not
failing, creating the file handle is the only alternative.  Below is a
logical explanation of what is happening inside both Xitami and XiFusion:

1)  A request comes to the Xitami webserver for a CGI-based application
(assume for this example XiFusion is associated with the file extension).
2)  Xitami calls the function process_create() to launch the CGI.
3)  Inside process_create(), the function redirect_io() is called three
times (once for each standard handle).  This creates three file I/O handles
which the CGI is supposed to dump its data into.  However, there is no test
for whether or not the file was opened successfully within redirect_io()
for both std_out and std_err.  If either fails to open,
INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is returned (which is -1) and the resulting value is
assigned to the STARTUPINFO structure that is submitted to CreateProcess().
4)  XiFusion is then launched via CreateProcess and then the process is
waited on (CreateProcess rarely ever fails (only under low system resources
will it fail) and I have yet to see WaitForSingleObject to fail as well - I
also have set my CGIs to run until they finish).  Note, at this point in
the Xitami code, it fails to detect whether WaitForSingleObject() fails or
not.
5)  XiFusion's underlying Borland C RTL fails to detect whether
GetStdHandle fails.  The value at this point should be INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
if Xitami failed to create the file handle.  All output data will therefore
fail to be displayed, hence zero bytes returned.
6)  XiFusion itself fails to check to see if its own stdout redirection
fails.  Hence the return of only one byte of data (padding) in some cases
where stdout was successfully created by Xitami.
7)  Only very rarely, will both redirected input and output handles get
created in Xitami and the redirected output handle in XiFusion (Xitami has
a better chance of creating the redirected input handle since it will
Sleep(1000) if it fails to be created).  This explains the occasional
correct number of bytes returned from the server.


MSDN Library demonstrates the correct way to start processes with
redirected input and output:

MSDN Library->Platform SDK->Base Services->DLLs, Processes, and
Threads->Processes and Threads->Using Processes and Threads->Creating a
Child Process with Redirected Input and Output

Unfortunately, most compiler writers use the poor example mentioned in the
CreateProcess() description.

Under normal circumstances this issue will not occur, but under very heavy
CGI usage, the problems will appear frequently (95-99% of the time).
End-users will be unable to get results and their browsers will, in many
cases, appear to hang on a completed webpage (zero bytes returned).
Several people have mentioned that I should make XiFusion a LRWP
application.  Doing this is possible, but a DoS/DDoS can still take place
just as easily (600 simultaneous users instead of 60).  It really does not
matter...the problem is that both Xitami and XiFusion have a major DoS/DDoS
issue that is going to take a while to fix.

Ewen, I have a 'localhost' version of the DAS/DAC ready if you want it for
testing purposes.  I don't want to distribute it to others because of the
implications this particular DoS has.

Hope this helps!

This gets pretty obvious when reading the docs for PHP :-)  Us Debian users
hardly ever read the docs unless we get something that doesn't work for some
reason - otherwise it's just apt-get install whatever, and it usually
works.  I had to do a little reading for this one - it's been a while since
I built custom apache servers, and the entire INSTALL file for PHP4 is
centered around how to build a static or dynamic module for apache.

That's the same observation I had.

My C skills are rusty to non-existant :-)  Otherwise I might spend some time
on this.  I think it would show some merit, though.  Xitami beats apache
hands down for serving static stuff - *WAY* less memory useage, and very
efficient on the cpu.  I've seen Xitami do some amazing things on a little
486/8MB machine that apache could send into a death spiral with no problem
:-)

I think the last version I tested was 2.4d7.  And you're right - I'm sure
contributions to an open source project would be appreciated!!!

This is really minor for a unix box when you have ssh access, anyway.  But
I'll throw something out;  my workstation is Debian 3.0/2.4.17-k6
kernel/KDE2.2.2.  With Konqueror I can't get the admin panel to work at
all.  With Netscape 6.2 it's funky sometimes.  With Netscape 4.78 I've
actually gotten the server to restart a couple of times, but it's not
consistent.  Do you suppose it might have something to do with the browser
and Javascript compatibility?

If anyone could answer this question I would be very grateful. I am having a
problem with the format of my Xitami log files. I am trying to use WebTrends
for stats reports and WebTrends does not want to open the Xitami log files.
I keep getting a message saying improper log format, log file probably
corrupt?
I have noticed that there are many different log file formats that you can
choose from the config options, can anyone tell me the best format to use
and what strings are necessary for each?
Also would anyone be able to suggest a better solution than WebTrends for
Web Stats Reporting that would run better with Xitami?

Thanks in advance.....

Quite possibly.  ISTR that there are either Javascript or CSS conflicts
with the webadmin pages which affect more recent browsers (compliant
with a new version of Javascript and/or CSS).  IIRC it was due to the
choice of a (javascript) variable names or something similar.

You might want to try disabling the Javascript in the webadmin and see
if that helps.  That said, config reloading in Xitami has always been a
tiny bit dodgy, particularly where the server is running setuid
something other than root.

The CLF (Common Logfile Format) format is generally considered the standard.

We use Webalizer on our servers, run from a daily cron job.  I can't
remember what their website is right offhand but a google search for
webalizer should get you there.  I've been able to process CLF files from
both Xitami and Apache with no problems.

sb. compiled a version for windows a week ago, i compiled a

Very interesting.

I wonder if this explains my persisitant GSL/XML problem(s). Sounds 
higly plausible.

I suppose I'd better look at the source to fiure out how the XML/GSL 
stuff differs from an external CGI. It is true that my XML problems have 
got worse when I use statements like
.xml from <filename>
thus requiring more files to be opened at a given moment.

Could you elaborate on those problems?  I have seen various, related
incidents in the past month or so since this issue arose.  The most recent
one is under Linux with CGIs causing the server to be very unresponsive
under heavy loads.  There was an earlier one with Win98 crashing on a low
memory system and many CGIs opening at once.  You get the idea...

Remember that filters are CGIs in "disguise."  They have somewhat different
properties than CGIs, but are basically the same.

Also, unless you have 50-60 simultaneous users on the system using CGIs,
this problem will go unnoticed.  However, a malicious attacker can easily
cause a DoS/DDoS with a simple tool that just requests CGI-oriented scripts
on the remote server to be executed - the server is quickly brought to its
knees and other users are unable to get webpages (usually the browser
appears to hang when the server replies with zero bytes of data - a flaw in
one of the Windows API calls that the browser has little control over).

Hope this helps!

Maybe never.

Xitami was released as a demo to promote a young programming
company, Imatix. In cross-platform and simplicity of use, it was
ahead of its time. Imatix has been quite successful, not by selling
and supporting Xitami but by selling programming tools and custom
software.

Xitami has been popular, but mostly because it is free. That
generates no income for Imatix, and they are not putting company
resources into it. They apparently have more than enough paid work
to keep them busy. They can't put someone on an Xitami problem for
hours or days, when paying customers are pushing money at them for
custom work.

Xitami is open source, but has not attracted the critical mass of
user support needed to carry on from where Imatix turned to paying
projects. That would be very nice, but I know I can't be of much
help with something as complex as a webserver, and apparently there
are not many others here who have the knowledge and time needed to
improve the product.

Ewen of Imatix, out of the goodness of his heart, and on his own
time, watches this list and has pushed some critical patches out.
But Xitami is still pretty much where it was several years ago. In
fact not counting the stuff added in the 2.5 beta, which was adopted
from other Imatix projects and tossed on top of 2.4, it is really
quite old.

If you want a up-to-date server with ample support, Apache is it.
There are 100 or 1,000 times more users of Apache than Xitami, which
apparently means more than enough skilled programmers to handle
improvements, and a large community of ordinary users to share
knowledge. That ini file in Apache makes my head spin, but it isn't
really all that hard, and Apache's many mature features and quick
patching make it worthwhile.

I'm still on Xitami. My needs are simple and Xitami works for me.
But the day I find something that Xitami just won't do, I'm off to
Apache.

BTW: V-hosts work fine for me with 2.4. Except sometimes the machine
needs to be re-booted to pick up the changes. Since I add a V-host
maybe once in 6 months, and Windows' TCP stack needs a kick every
few months, I don't see it as a problem. For a many-customer ISP,
where V-hosts would be added daily, Xitami probably isn't the best
choice.

The CLF (Common Logfile Format) format is generally considered the standard.

We use Webalizer on our servers, run from a daily cron job. I can't
remember what their website is right offhand but a google search for
webalizer should get you there. I've been able to process CLF files from
both Xitami and Apache with no problems.

You haven't followed the instructions from someone else (under the

otherwise?

PLEASE don't post to any mailing list or newsgroup in HTML, and

Your initial post on this matter was less than 3kB long (even though it

I believe (BICBW) that "sb" is an abbreviation for "somebody".  I see
this abbreviation used in many newsgroups, by German speakers writing in
English.  I cannot remember ever seeing it used by anyone for whom
English is their first language (no, not even by a schoolkid 'sndng
txt msgs 2 hs m8t usng SMS' :-)

One also sees "so" for "someone" as well.  Quite where this usage
originated, I don't know; certainly neither abbreviation is to be found
in any dictionary of the English language.   (To me, "sb" is an
abbreviation USED BY dictionaries, for "substantive", whilst "so" is
sometimes seen in newsgroups, as "SO", for "significant other".)

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami2.4d9 and PHP4


I tested Xitami for about a year and a half, then finally gave up on it and
went back to Apache.  I'm back testing it again, trying to run a php4 driven
MySQL database application to see if it will reduce CPU/memory load over
what Apache uses.  The server is running on a twin Pentium-Pro, powered by
Debian Linux/2.2.19 kernel, and 512MB RAM.  Apache version is 1.3.24 with
PHP4.4.1 as loadable module for Apache, and using the php4-mysql module to
drive the database.  All applications installed with Debian debs from the
woody distro.

Question:
Can Xitami be used with the PHP module for Apache, or do I have to compile a
seperate PHP app on the server?  If I need the seperate PHP app, I'll
compile it and drop it in.

Question:
It's been awhile, but if I remember correctly, to enable parsing of PHP you
have to add a line for a filter like: .php=/path/to/php4/executable ???

Other observations:
* Xitami *still* doesn't write a PID file on UNIX platforms.  This was one
of my pet peeves with the previous versions as well - it'd be nice to be
able to run Xitami from init.d or tcpserver on UNIX hosts instead of having
to use killall to stop the process and a script to start it when
configurations are changed or virtual domains added or removed.

* The FTP server still won't handle hardly any load at all - I've found I
can't use it for serious FTP work.

* The webbased admin panel still positively rocks - much easier than editing
Apache's config file via ssh, and then reloading the server with
/etc/init.d/apache reload.  But I can't get Xitami's server restart function
to work every time when throwing in a new domain or making other config
changes that require reload of the /usr/local/bin/xitami/defaults.cfg file.
I've found I still have to ssh to the box, kill xitami, then execute the
start script to fire it back up and force the config file reload.  Others
have this problem?

I got it working in short order, Greg.  That was the easy part.  I was
curious to see if Xitami could handle the same load as Apache
1.3.24/mod-PHP4 driving a MySQL database server, and do it using less memory
and CPU.  I found out rather dramatically that it can't - Xitami came to a
grinding halt when things got busy.

I'm trying to get Blorpscript, which is a script that dynamically creates
pages based on directory contents. One of the features is using ImageMagick
to create thumbnails, well, apparently Xitami won't let me execute
imagemagick from a PHP script, any ideas how to fix.

Yes, I've been getting them on an address that I rarely use and is only a
month old.  I've been getting the messages that say stuff like "Check out my
