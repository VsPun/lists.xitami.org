<PRE>You said WordStar - you're my hero.  People often ask me what got me started 
in computers, and routinely point out my first days on a computer using 
WordStar.  Most have no idea what it is or what it was.  But I can honestly 
say that using WordStar (a summer job doing word processing (I could type 
fast) for a company that took printed federal regulations codes and put them 
on disk for gov't contractors) got me familiar with keyboard interaction and 
more importantly a fundamental understanding of coding.  WordStar is almost 
like HTML in a sense where &quot;.b blah blah blah blah .b&quot; would bold the line 
(or what ever the syntax was), it was those kind of associations that 
literally made something in my mind go &quot;click: ah I get it!&quot; and then after 
that I sought out Pascal to begin teaching myself programming.

18 years later I am an accomplished sr level network engineer, routinely 
program in JS/PHP/Perl/MySQL etc, run my own web based businesses.  All of 
which is self taught (as I was a History major in college) and I still smile 
when some one asks how I got started in computers.  I grin with a bit of 
fondness as I answer: &quot;WordStar&quot;

ah, the memories.  :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; The way it reads is that any user accessing the site, the first one
</I>&gt;<i> to see the message has the option to abort your reboot
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a VB routine to access the site via winhttp ever minute.  If it fails
</I>&gt;<i> to get a response it will become visual, warn the person using the
</I>&gt;<i> machine that it will reboot in 1 minute.  If the user does not abort the
</I>&gt;<i> reboot it reboots and Xitami restarts on the reboot.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Says to me that he runs the webserver in the background on a workstation
</I>&gt;<i> which may have a colleague *sitting at it*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back in the late 1980s, I ran servers in workstations. A 286 can do
</I>&gt;<i> NetWare 2 and WordStar at the same time. And you could rig it so NW
</I>&gt;<i> errors did, or did-not, get posted to the screen for the user's
</I>&gt;<i> attention. At home I often ran Xitami just for local uses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that a dedicated machine is usually a better plan than a
</I>&gt;<i> user-workstation. Users tend to flog windows (yes, and unixes) into a
</I>&gt;<i> jam once a month, while my server-only machines run many months.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, if a machine has a regular user, and the power blips or a re-start
</I>&gt;<i> stalls, the user will do something (kick it, hard restart, or call
</I>&gt;<i> Gary). One of my low-use unattended machines was down for a day and I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9 out of 10 times, a service restart fixes the problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In NT4 and up, yes, service restart usually clears the problem. (I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know Vista.)
