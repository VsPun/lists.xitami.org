<PRE>Out of interest, (after suffering myself from Xitami dying every now and
again under Win2k3 server), have you installed Xitami as a service on this
box? (&quot;xisrv32 -install&quot;). If so, check the properties of the service
(funnily enough, Microsoft allowed for the eventuality that services might
stop responding and die!!). Check out the properties of the Xitiami service
and look in the 'Recovery' tab. Simply change the First Failure, Second
Failure and Subsequent Failures to 'Restart Service' (hell - why not?!)

One other thing that helped me an awful lot was the &quot;recover=&quot; parameter in
xitami.cfg. Not quite sure of the mileage in this one though.

Cheers,
Stuart

PS. As for dead HD's - you've got yourself a bad one if it's only from 2003!
Mind you, was there a drive on the market in 2003 big enough to hold a
minimal fresh install of the heavily code-bloated Vista? Why's it bloated
you ask? Because it's full of: &quot;Do you want to do this?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Do you
REALLY want to do this?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Windows thinks this is idea and has stopped
it anyway&quot; &quot;Darn..&quot;

Well after a few days of fighting, turning off security features, another
bad hard drive and shear persistence things seem to be running fairly
smoothly. Xitami still dumps from time to time but Always Up turns it back
on.  Hard telling what the bad hard drive was causing but dumps seem to
happen less often.  Funny these drives don't last forever.LOL. I think this
one goes back to 2003 or farther. 

 

Anyway back in business,

 

Cheers,

Ron

I pulled back to version 2.4 and it solved the crash problems I was having
on VISTA.

The basic problem with VISTA is the security &quot;enhancements&quot;.  I have to
disable most of the new enhancements to use VISTA.
