<PRE>I have Xitami running on several machines at several locations.  All but one
are running XP sp2.  The exception is running VISTA.  I get a rare crash at
all but one site.  That site is the most stable and I don't have a clue why.
It is running a raid drive array (the only site that does) so that might be
the reason.

Most of my CGI processes are written in VB 6 sp2.  I do have a few BATs that
do utility things like back-ups and kick of sessions in a database that
supports this feature.  All that works exceptionally well.  I use Xitami
for more than just web sites.  It is the server that puts in nTier in my
network.  I have my home grown server that operates as a fileserver and I
use that on ports other than 80.  The reason I use Ximati for a fileserver
enabler is that some of my user's company policy does not allow a tunnel
through their firewall for any other port.  Besides, Ximati works so well
for that it's hard to ignore it.

All the above brings me to my point.  Since an unrecovered crash is so bad
for me, I just wrote a VB routine to access the site via winhttp ever
minute.  If it fails to get a response it will become visual, warn the
person using the machine that it will reboot in 1 minute.  If the user does
not abort the reboot it reboots and Xitami restarts on the reboot.  I don't
attempt to clear the error nor restart Xitami, it's just cleaner to reboot.
I have the option to have it send me a text message to my cell phone to tell
me.

If anyone would like to have a copy of the VB executablable I'll modify it
(right now I hardcode the url) so that you can configure it for the url you
want checked.  Just let me know and I'll do the mod and post it to my
website.
