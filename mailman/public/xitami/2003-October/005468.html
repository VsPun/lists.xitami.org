<PRE> That's a very good point.  I am also a member of a bunch of automotive =
sites, but only &quot;surf&quot; one of them regularly.  (Check in several times a =
day).  The others I just pop in now and then, mainly to look through =
classifieds. =20

 So when the subject is something that people are mainly only interested =
in when there is a problem and there isn't on going daily discussions, =
an email list does benefit those of us who only have an occasional =
question.

-----Original Message-----

I am a member of a couple of forums and I find myself just reading the
messages.  If I have to login to answer any questions then I usually =
just
don't.  So if I have to got a webpage, then login, just to answer a =
question
then the list will suffer.

Just my $.02
