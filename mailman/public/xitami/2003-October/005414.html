Your request made me realize that perhaps Usenet might be a better
approach.  (1) it's distributed, rather than reliant upon a single server
site; (2) the propagation mechanisms are already there; (3) DejaGoogle
provides an archive and searching mechanism.

So I hunted around to see what sort of groups already exist; I had
expected to see, for example, groups discussing apache.  To my surprise,
althought there were some national groups (in japan.* and dk.*), and also
an alt group, there was nothing in the Big-8 comp.* hierarchy.

ISTM that the correct place would have been in a sub-division of
comp.infosystems.www.server.*; however, the taxonomy of that is by O/S
platform.  Is anyone on this mailing list already active anywhere within
that comp.i.w.s.* hierarchy?

&gt;<i> In a sense, Xitami be building a knowledge base built by its own user=20
</I>&gt;<i> community.

There IS an archive of these mailing list posts: details are in the
headers.

[BTW, _one_ of the annoying aspects of a mailing list is repeated
regurgitation of untrimmed quoted material by those that post their
comments at the top.  Much unnecessary volume could be cut from this
present list if all posters learnt how to formulate replies properly.

50 unnecessarily quoted lines snipped :-( ]
