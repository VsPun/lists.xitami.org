Hi All,

Happy new year for 2009.

It's been a while since we stopped working on Xitami/2.5.

Well, we've started on a new version of Xitami, which will be called
Xitami/5.  (Versions 3 and 4 were started, and dropped, internally.)

It'll be a while before this becomes a polished stand-alone product,
and that will only happen if people ask for it and help make it so.
Our main reason for restarting this concept is that we need a small,
tough server as the front-end for new web services we're making.

Xitami/5 will remind you a lot of Xitami: compact, efficient, and easy
to configure.  It won't have CGI or LRWP, unless someone helps make
this.  It's meant above all to be scalable on multicore boxes, secure
(it will have SSL support), and unhackable. It will run on most OSes
but we're not going to spend time making nice Win32 front-ends.  It
will run without ever crashing.

I've put a post on www.zyre.com (Zyre is the new web messaging service
we're making) that explains a little more.

Technical details: Xitami/5 uses the Base2 server framework we built
for OpenAMQ (www.openamq.org).  That gives us multithreading and a
nice development environment.

As we get code that works, and if there is interest, we'll put up a
new website.  In the meantime, we've put up a sample of the new
documentation here: http://xitami.wikidot.com/doc:xitami-5.

Hi Pieter,

Happy new year to you too!

I just want to wish you guys the best of luck! Xitami/2.5 is a brilliant
webserver and does its job really well! Lightweight, efficient and has stood
the test of time! (I'm still using it since NT days even now - on a bunch of
2k3 boxes)

It's a shame about the CGI development with Xitami/5 though. Back in the
early days, it was a deciding factor of me using Xitami in the first place
(incidentally - VB CGI ftw!! I don't know if anyone else shares the same
'enthusiasm' for CGI VB? Thought not. lol!).

I'd love to help with CGI dev - but I think you're are a 'real' programmer
(not some VB'er!). But once again, god speed guys! It's great to know that
Xitami isn't dead yet!!

Best news of the New Year!  Cannot wait for this new 
release.....Although I am pretty happy with 2.5, been a loyal user from 
the beginning.  Think it was somewhere around 1991???

This sounds fantastic, and am glad the Xitami torch will carry on.  Its been 
rock steady for years, has few limitations and still does the job better 
than Apache (apples to apples).  Heck, I even got a custom version of URL 
rewrites to work (converting dyanmic urls to static urls), something that is 
built into Apache but had to be bastardized to work with Xitami.

Anyway, I would like to contribute in anyway I can.  However, I don't 
believe I am the kind of sophisticated programmer that you need assisting in 
developing the various aspects of this new webserver.  I primarily do CGI, 
PHP and MySQL scripting.  But you need assistance with Admin forms and 
technical help pages or such, then let me know.

Keep me in mind if you can remember to do so.  :-)

Hello Pieter,

I don't see any mentioning of FastCGI, SCGI, Proxying, URL Rewriting
in your post or your email. I think these are essential features to
any modern web server. Any plan to include those?

Same thing here.

I choosed for Xitami in the first place for it's easy CGI implementation. Still use Xitami for it's CGI capabilities (using powerbasic, not visual basic) on w'98, w2000 and xp pro

This is good feedback.  OK, so CGI is important for Xitami/5.  Can you
explain why you felt it was easier in Xitami than in other web
servers?

At the time I was deciding which webserver to use, I knew Visual Basic
(whichever version at the time) inside out.

Support for VB EXE's as CGI applications seemed to be much more supported
within Xitami (with code examples - which actually worked!
http://www.clifton-fields.co.uk/cgi-bin/showprod.exe ). I'm not too sure if
Apache support them now, but Xitami is what I coded them in originally, it
does the job well and I for one am sticking with it!!

In answer to your question though Pieter, I think that the documentation for
making compiled VB applications work under Xitami was a major contributing
factor of me choosing Xitami.

If you need any help writing the doc for this new release - I'll sure lend a
hand!

Cheers,

Stuart

Stuart,

OK, good.  The thing with Xitami was that it would examine the file to
see if it was executable, so there was no configuration needed beyond
sticking the .exe in the right place.  We can reuse that code.

There is an open wiki, http://xitami.wikidot.com, and it would be
great to rewrite some of the old docs on making CGI work... this would
then help us actually design the necessary code.

I am also a loyal Xitami user with about 20 virtual sites running not to
mention maybe 100 or 150 virtual subdomain sites. Xitami handles them all
quite well. 

Primarily the major concern is for it to be more stable running on MS Vista
and the new flavors of Windows 7 and versions of MS Windows server. I'm not
a Linux person. Xitami constantly crashes on Vista, in fact it also crashed
on XP and I had to run Always Up to restart it when it crashed. On Vista
Always Up will restart it half of the time and sometimes it's down for 8
hours or more before I can get to it. I'm not a programmer so I don't know
how or why that is and what can be done about it. 

The second issue I have is minor for me but something I'd like to see, and
that is the ability to run ASP. I have had customers go with someone else
because I don't have ASP capability. 

Oh and very minor is the Mod ReWrite like Apache.  

Something else that Apache has is integrated PHP, MySQL and some flavors
throw in ASP. Man that would make Xitami the ultimate web server. 

But all in all I still love Xitami and refuse to even try anything else. I
can have a new site up and running in a matter of minutes even quicker if I
use my batch file to quickly set up the new site. I don't use the GUI
although I might consider a PHP GUI if it was better designed. Apache has
some interesting GUI Interfaces designed for it.


My 2 cents,


Thank you,
Ron

Yes just to add my two pennies worth "Wonderful news for the new year to hear about Xitami 5"  I have been a user on Windows since back with Win95 10 years ago.  The current version seems stable on a minimal XP installation - runs for days without errors.  I was just thinking I would have to soon look again at Apache but now I will wait.

  Hi All,

Happy new year for 2009.

It's been a while since we stopped working on Xitami/2.5.

Well, we've started on a new version of Xitami, which will be called
Xitami/5.  (Versions 3 and 4 were started, and dropped, internally.)

It'll be a while before this becomes a polished stand-alone product,
and that will only happen if people ask for it and help make it so.
Our main reason for restarting this concept is that we need a small,
tough server as the front-end for new web services we're making.

Xitami/5 will remind you a lot of Xitami: compact, efficient, and easy
to configure.  It won't have CGI or LRWP, unless someone helps make
this.  It's meant above all to be scalable on multicore boxes, secure
(it will have SSL support), and unhackable. It will run on most OSes
but we're not going to spend time making nice Win32 front-ends.  It
will run without ever crashing.

I've put a post on www.zyre.com (Zyre is the new web messaging service
we're making) that explains a little more.

Technical details: Xitami/5 uses the Base2 server framework we built
for OpenAMQ (www.openamq.org).  That gives us multithreading and a
nice development environment.

As we get code that works, and if there is interest, we'll put up a
new website.  In the meantime, we've put up a sample of the new
documentation here: http://xitami.wikidot.com/doc:xitami-5.

This is good feedback.  OK, so CGI is important for Xitami/5.  Can you
explain why you felt it was easier in Xitami than in other web
servers?


One of the big advantages of Xitami over others (for instance Aprelium Abyss) is that Xitami allows different configurations for i/o: streams or files. Streams 
(standard input/ standard output) seems to be much faster, but windows has trouble handling large amounts of data (forms processing including images in excess 
of 1MB). It's really a windows thing, using different workarounds can alleviate the problem (for instance using SLEEP commands in the source code, fine tuning 
the code to read STDIN). With files, you just look at the size of the input file and slurp it in one piece into your application.

Working with files for i/o is much more user friendly. For instance, you can write your application the way you like, and if there is an error condition 
somewhere (input field without data), you can rewrite the html output file from the beginning.
I also like the way Xitami handles the CGI output: look at the first line and decide if it's NPH (non parsed headers). Really great! Makes it possible to write 
and if necessary rewrite html response output on the fly. And you always can look at the files to pinpoint a problem.

I also like the way Xitami assumes it's an executable, by looking at the directory. So you can avoid using telltale extensions www.site.com/apx/process.EXE
Just using an url www.site.com/apx/process is enough to get the application running.

Compared to other servers, the way the configuration files are handled are the best: first load the defaults config file, the use the general config (containing 
the differences from the default file), and at last use the specific config file for a host. It's CCC: Cascading Config Configuration!

I've tried lots of servers, and Xitami is still the easiest to use and the most stable in the long run.
Still missing in Xitami is a native gzip encoding.
What i would like is a way to tell Xitami "the output is done and you can send it to the user, i'm still doing some housecleaning"

Hi Marc,

This feedback is great.  I'm collecting pertinent points on the wiki.
Feel free to add more.  No firm promises, but it would be good to
collect the strongest features of the old Xitami into the new
architecture and get back to regular releases of the product.

Can I confirm that people are generally happy with a plain vanilla
binary for Windows, i.e. the console version?  Making win32-specific
services and GUIs is a lot of work.

A console version would be enough, i don't use the control panel. Tickering with the config files and eventually using the html administration console is the way to go. But it must be able to run as a service. Having to start it with a service manager (like firedaemon) is a pita. srvany.exe (application included in windows to start applications as services) runs fine on w2k, not on XP

The console-version-only gets my vote too. One thing I would add if anything
would be a debug switch (maybe "xidos32 -debug" for instance?) that
summarises in real time what the hell it's doing! (obviously not meant for
production environments - but great for fault finding on a test bed).
"Opening up port 80 for this, 81 for this, couldn't open 81 - already in
use, 81.81.81.81 requested / - return code 200, 81.81.81.82 requested
/something.htm - return code 404, etc"

The last time I ever used the GUI was under Windows 3.1! Never really looked
at it since. Come to think of it, it was around that time that I last used
the web-based interface too! (I just don't like admin panels diddling around
with carefully constructed config files).

The only other thing I would change would be making it easier (or better
documented?) to kill the /admin page (I ended up just #'ing out the xiadmin
WSX agent line - better ways of doing this?). But I really am just
nit-picking now..

Yes, this is useful.  We do that in other servers.  Produces a lot of
output but essential for debugging complex configs.

I have been using Xtiami 2.4d9 for years...made the upgrade to 2.5 and had 
problems so I went back to 2.4d9.  Xitami has crashed but ONCE in 6 years 
(and the fix was to stop the service and restart it, but even that can be 
managed with Windows Services properties).  And through those 6 years I 
moved Xitami to NT, to W2K, and now its on W2K3.  I had more problems with 
windows than I ever did with Xitami.

Heres a brief list of things I think should be added or considered:

1. Full PHP implementation
2. Continued CGI support
        a.  Without CGI support, the bulk of current Xitami users won't have 
an upgrade path and may never cut over because there current websites are so 
heavily coded in Perl.  I have one website alone that is about 48,000 lines 
of perl - I sure as heck don't look forward to migrating that code.
        b.  Perl is such an efficient and well documented language that 
allows users to interface with system commands.  My experience with PHP is 
that its not as easy and has less features when it comes to system 
interfacing.
        c.  Isn't Perl the foundation of PHP anyway?  :-)
3.  Self Installing Windows version is probably a must - but GUIs aren't 
necessary.  The web based admin and text config editing is more than 
sufficient.  Obvioulsy it needs to be a service install for windows.
4.  I don't see the need to implement MySQL specific support like 
"WAMP"...in my experience users choose different DBs for various reaons, 
keeping it open to and versatile to other DBs is going to be a more 
attractive webserver and it will keep Xitami's memory and system foot print 
much smaller.
5. VB/ASP support is probably necessary as well.

6.  Xitamis's I/O management of file uploads needs to be fixed.  Currently 
Xitami locks the filehandles of standard html file uploads.  Also, Xitami 
treats a 20 file upload as a single transfer. And because of this you can't 
read the current status of the file upload (whether its one or 20 files) 
which prevents you from providing progress updates to the user.  A 5mg 
upload could take a few minutes and without a status update for the user 
they may think things have timed out and abort.    This same issue which 
prevents you from reading the status of the IO also prevents you from 
writing data to a temporary file during the upload, for some reason while 
Xitami is reading and writing the inbound data stream, it can't write to 
another temporary file, another method for obtaining the current upload 
status. AND the returning web page doesn't not appear until the upload is 
done.  So on big uploads, or multi-file uploads the user stares at blank 
page.

    Example code of file upload:

binmode(OUTFILE);
undef $BytesRead;
undef $Buffer;
open(tmpFile, ">/temp/blahblahblah.tmp") ;
while ($Bytes = read($file_handle,$Buffer,1024)) {
   $BytesRead += $Bytes;
   print tmpFile $
   print OUTFILE $Buffer;
}
$confirm{$file_handle} = $BytesRead;
close($file_handle);
close(OUTFILE);

If I were to write to a temp file in the middle of that while loop, the temp 
file would only be updated AFTER the while loop/upload was completed.  I 
have no idea why though.  I then used the same code on Apache it worked as 
designed.

7. I have gotten my own version of Mod Rewrite to work on Xitami, though it 
would be nice to see a more uniform implementation of it supported.  There 
is still a bit of manual configs at the server level that one has to do. 
URL rewrites are key for Seach Engine Optimization.  I used CGI aliases to 
map a keywords to specific scripts, then those scripts needed the HTML_ENV 
or CGI ENV variables to break up the the url path to retrieve the rest of 
the dynamic variables
    [CGI ALIAS]
    /adList/ = "/cgi-bin/postList.pl"

    And then in postList.pl used the following to retrieve the variables:
    @pathVars = split(/\//,$ENV{'PATH_INFO'}) ; ### split the URL path on 
'/'
    @httpHost = split(/\./,$ENV{'HTTP_HOST'}) ;  ### split the full domain 
name on the '.'

    Whats handy about the CGI Alias is that $ENV believes the url path 
starts AFTER the alias
    So: www.blah.com/adlist/these/are/dynamic/vars - $ENV sees the URL as 
/these/are/dynamic/vars
    I then do: /adlist/these/are/dynamic/vars/ad_12345.html , using the 
'ad_12345.html' as the article ID

    Each script must know whats a variable...so it does require a bit of 
unique coding per script, but if you design your site well enough you can 
basically write your own procs to do it all for you.

8.  32bit and 64bit versions should be available.

9.  Ditch the FTP stuff.  It never worked well to begin with.

10.  Fix the vitual server administration issue.  If I create a virtual 
domain and give administration authority to another user, that user with 
their own password designed to administer the virtual domain now has access 
to the entire server configuration.

11. Continued support for perlssi

12. Supply password encryption in the .aut files....clear text passwords is 
a big no-no.

13. Make Extended CLF logging the standard format

14.  Allow for better control of default Error pages, 301 redirects to 
failed pages, or pages not found, to a standard error page

15. Is it possible to integrate sessionID directly into the server?

Thats all I can think of at the moment.  :-)

Russel,

A detailed set of requirements!

Would you be able to write-up these on the wiki?  I guess the useful
thing for now is just to collect ideas and requirements (things people
use or really want) so that we don't lose them.

Obviously it'll take some time to work through this list but I assume
anyone still using Xitami has the patience of a saint to begin with.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami/5 - new project announcement

Xitami community,

I too am excited to hear about Xitami/5. We have been using it bundled with
our product since the OS/2 days of 1993 or so.  It has served us well except
for two things: 1) the ftp server started crashing with heavy usage and 2)
Recently we have mysterious locks up of the server. We don't care about the
ftp server, since we can throw on something like Filezilla. The lock ups are
a problem and have caused us to consider re-writing our application as an
ISAPI plugin.

The only catch with Xitami/5 is that need LRWP support, which I'm sure
nobody is interested in and therefore would be last on the list, or not on
the list at all. We would be willing to look at something like FAST CGI or
maybe writing a plug in.

I need CGI or SSI to implement my webmail and remote access features.
These work well with Xitmai 2 in either mode.  I have implemented in
lighttpd, but it is a royal pain compared to Xitami (though nowhere NEAR
the pain Apache is)!  

If you are dead set against CGI, I understand.  I would hope that you
will leave some way for us to implement features lacking in the server
itself for our custom services.

Other than that, please keep the primary characteristics that we love
from current Xitami builds: security, easy of configuration through
manual editing of flat files, efficiency of operation.  We need no gui,
and I personally care little about the Windows build.  
I can always run Linux under Windows in a virtual environment if needed.

Hi All,

Happy new year for 2009.

It's been a while since we stopped working on Xitami/2.5.

Well, we've started on a new version of Xitami, which will be called
Xitami/5.  (Versions 3 and 4 were started, and dropped, internally.)

It'll be a while before this becomes a polished stand-alone product,
and that will only happen if people ask for it and help make it so.
Our main reason for restarting this concept is that we need a small,
tough server as the front-end for new web services we're making.

Xitami/5 will remind you a lot of Xitami: compact, efficient, and easy
to configure.  It won't have CGI or LRWP, unless someone helps make
this.  It's meant above all to be scalable on multicore boxes, secure
(it will have SSL support), and unhackable. It will run on most OSes
but we're not going to spend time making nice Win32 front-ends.  It
will run without ever crashing.

I've put a post on www.zyre.com (Zyre is the new web messaging service
we're making) that explains a little more.

LRWP is probably doable, and FastCGI would also be useful.  If you're
willing to consider writing a plugin, we'll document the module API
and explain how to write plugins.

Interesting, but: why do we need another HTTP server?

 > we need a small, tough server

OK. I'll suggest that Apache is reasonably tough and small enough to run 
on very modest machines. But Apache is far from "unhackable". The core 
is getting fairly low-bugs, but it is so feature-rich that it invites 
probes at every keyhole.

 >  FastCGI, SCGI, Proxying, URL Rewriting

Adding all this stuff (even having the interface to add stuff) tends to 
increase hacks and crashes. So what is the goal: tight or fancy? I think 
it is whatever Pieter says it is, for his needs.

 >  It will run without ever crashing.
 >  Xitami constantly crashes ...I had to run Always Up to restart it

Like Hogan, my Xitami (and my Apaches) "still runs flawless here".

 > seems stable on a minimal XP installation - runs for days without errors.

My webservers NEVER go down, except power-loss and monthly Win Update 
re-starts. Mostly bare installations of Win-2003 (which is nearly XP 
without frills).

One is still on WinNT4, and currently show 3,225 hours (134 days) 
uptime, the last power-failure.

Frequent crashing suggests that you have another application which is 
trying to grab Xitami's port, or something tricky like bad RAM.

 > CGI is important ... explain why you felt it was easier in Xitami 
than in other web servers?

Historical: Back in 1995 I was told to use MS PWS. It works. It had a 
few sample "CGI-like" applications written to an MS proprietary 
interface. Enabling common CGI required hacking both PWS settings and 
Registry entries, and was strongly discouraged. (I think the real goal 
was to make you buy MS-brand programming tools.) I used PWS for a year 
and never got CGI working.

I got a spare box w/2MB RAM. This was ample to run Win3.1 and Xitami. 
(Incidentally, it was a fine fast server but a terrible slow browser.) I 
read the Xitami docs, realized CGI was just a EXEC call, and wrote a DOS 
BAT file which output "Hello World!"... 20 minutes from reading the docs 
to working CGI. Overnight I wrote a filter EXE with QuickBasic (DOS, not 
Windows!) and it worked right-off. Only the 64KB limit in QB forced me 
to VB, and yes the sample VB code in the Xitami package helped me make a 
non-Visual VB filter.

That was over a decade ago. PHP is a nasty hack but useful. PHP has been 
coded around Apache bugs, particularly environment variable names. 
Sooner or later, most of my servers hit a place where a specific PHP 
script would not work with Xitami but worked first-try with Apache. I 
detest Apache's mud-pit INI file, but hey I can usually flog it into 
doing what I need. And FWIW, that NT4 machine up for 134 days is running 
two copies of -Apache-, just as solid as when it ran Xitami.

 > CCC: Cascading Config Configuration!

Yes, the murkiness of Apachi with multiple INI files is dreadful. 
Instead I run one file which takes days to scroll through......

 > I also like the way Xitami assumes it's an executable, by looking at 
the directory.

In "cgi-bin" context, Xitami uses much the same logic(?) as MS-DOS 2.0. 
You type "123" at the command line, DOS looks for 123.EXE, 123.COM, 
123.BAT in the current directory (and then along PATH). When it finds 
one, it does not rely on the EXE extension: the file must have an MZ 
header and a non-null pointer into code to invoke the EXE loader. (BAT 
files have to be texty; COM files have to be run blind.) Xitami on DOS 
does have another trick: if a script explicitly points to a directory 
which does not exist, Xitami will search down PATH. This handles the 
case of a unix-standard script run on a DOS box where directory 
conventions are different, and usually does the right thing.

 > the console version?  Making win32-specific services and GUIs is a 
lot of work.

There is general need for a "service". It can load before user log-in 
(some of my boxes, I don't touch for a year at a time). It has some 
extra privileges relative to a user-space program. Vista tends to try to 
be very strict about user-space apps but has to cut some slack for 
services. (OTOH a misbehaving service can do more damage to the rest of 
the system.)

GUI, beyond a webpage to set settings, is not needed. Or let some 
customer demand (and pay for) it.

For static serving, Xitami is much faster than Apache, significantly 
more lightweight, and handles multiple requests like a champ. However, 
now there is lighttpd which is actively developed for this very role. If 
you want to pay there is litespeed which is apache compatible but much 
faster.

Message-ID: <49638B3B.20008@gmail.com>

I only have used Xitami locally to test sites before posting them on the web for several years now.

This past year I installed the Abyss web server because with Xitami I could never get SSI (server side includes) to work locally.   I use them extensively for side menus and footers.   So I could never view the full contents of a web page using Xitami.   I would be great to have SSI working in Xitami and have it recognize directory structures so that the contents of the SSI could be in whatever directory and still have it display from any directory.

Hi,

Would you post some examples of what you do with SSI on the wiki site?
 Something like a set of (simple) test pages that do everything you
expect.

	TOPIC?
Message-ID: <20090106.095056.8042.0@webmail01.dca.untd.com>

My response to all of this is a bit off topic but I thought it would be a good time to chime in because indirectly, in a way it is not...
BTW Magnus you for sure have a neat looking site-Bravo, it just takes so long to load on my end. I do have a question if anyone could pls help me on my new project? I have little to offer technically but I run several websites using an older X-serv version, I think it is prior to when the install made all the subdirs like "app" and so on....
I use a service from ip-address.com to track the location of incomings, this helps in keeping up with the ISS firewall logs used in conjunction with Xitami logs so as attacks are located both distance wise from my IP and the physical location-as well as the types of incoming bombs which pose the threats. Often the server gets "poisoned" by local DNS and there are ways to totally take over your connection. I won't go into to all of that now, that would be a dissertation.
What I would like to know is: can I run X-server from within my website directory? The reason for this is that I thought it might be easier to manage incoming connections by placcing all the xitami sub domain and virtual domain folders in the "private" directory so that any virtual home requests would be challenged for an ID and PW which I would give out. For example, I can find almost anyones email addr freind or foe to my web (even though they may or not be suspect of having malicous intent). I can gather this info from their IP address assuming it was not masked. Once I have their email addr I can find out their true identity, that is, only if the account was not an alias or anon. as so many are today. But regardless, this still helps me profile my visitors (am I allowed to say that...har har:)  Once a profile is made then I can invite visitors (theoretically) to sign up, assign an ID/PW, and since they would be returning through another virtual address, ie through the private directory by invitation, they would be identified and monitored with good standing, eliminating the need for tracebacks. This may be a pain for most folks on both ends but I would like to create a following that way but without charging $ for membership. Any ideas?  ie on how to make the private directory the gateway for all the virtual domains? tis Jon - a ten year XserverUsr with no technical knowhow whatsoever - Happy New Year all.

Pieter,

LRWP are a very distinguished feature of Xitami, something that makes it
possibile to write very solid and very very fast sites.

I'd ask, if possibile, to add them to Xitami/5.

Thanks!

Maurilio.

Brian,

LRWP are a must :) for me as well.

Best regards.

Maurilio.

PS. I'm still running OS/2 version with a bunch of LRWP processes every day.

Yes, indeed.  LRWP was well documented by Ewen McNeill, who made the
Xitami implementation, and it should be easy to make a module for that
in Xitami/5.

LRWP works with any language (there are examples in C and Python in
the doc) and gives something that looks a lot like CGI, but is much
faster (processes don't stop and start, so can remain 'hot').

I have, for the most part, moved to lighttpd now that I've migrated to
linux. I'd be quite happy to move back to a Xitami server if it
presented clear benefits with regards to perl and/or PHP integration.

(I'm assuming that the new Xitami will be at least as good as the old
one when it comes to static content)

Pieter,

LRWP has, if I'm not wrong, another advantage over fast-cgi and this is the
ability for a LRWP process to register itself with the web-server for a
particular URL so that it handles always that URL.

I mean, I use LRWP for .prg files (script files with a xbase dialect inside),
I have xitami configured to execute a cgi-bin program when an URL contains
.prg, when the user asks for that URL xitami executes my cgi-bin program
passing to it the required URL, my program executes the script (to answer the
request) but, before ending, it starts an istance of itself which registers
back with xitami for the same url. From now on all requests for that URL will
be handled by this instance of the cgi-bin executable (and this kind of
'routing' of requests is handled by xitami itself).

In this way every URL/page/frame/etc. which is handled by a .prg files has its
instance of the interpreter running (after the first request), this makes the
site very robust, a problem on a page does not affect the entire site, and
fast, since the script (.prg file) gets evaluated (compiled on the fly) only
once (up until a certain idle time, when the LRWP process shuts itself down).

Best regards.

Maurilio.

LRWP programs can be written in any language. They accept a socket
connection from Xitami, and send the output back to xitami on the same
socket. The process is always running with multiple sockets always connected
to Xitami, so its very fast.

I am curious - as I am not to familiar with LRWP - your description below gives me pause.  Does that mean that on a busy server every time a new URL is executed that a new 'instance' will be held in memory?  I completely understand the speed related to separate processes remaining in memory allow the next instance of that same url to run lightning fast - but how much memory is eaten up keeping these processes alive - and how does that affect over all system performance?  What if too many are held in memory - how does it manage new calls if memory is too full?

Thanks

There's a good description of LRWP here:

(I earlier said Ewen McNeill had written this but in fact it was Robin Dunn.)

Begining with version 2.2a, Xitami includes a persistent CGI extension 
called LRWP, (which stands for Long Running Web Process.) LRWP is 
written as a WSX agent which implements a simple protocol for 
communicating with external processes called Peers. The peer process 
simply waits for the requests to come from Xitami and then responds with 
a valid http response, just like a CGI program. The main difference is 
that like other persistent CGI solutions, the LRWP peer waits around for 
another HTTP request instead of terminating.

Why would anyone need this?  Seems like a waste of time coding when it 
is so simple in PHP.  What kinda server would require a a sustained 
connection and what would it do to the system memory?

Many developers don't want to, or can't use PHP.  LRWP works with any
language.

The persistent connection is cheap, and allows the server to queue up
requests so they can be processed one after the other by the LRWP app.

It's not about A vs. B, choice is useful.  Also, from the perspective
of the web server, it's far simpler to implement LRWP than to natively
support PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.

Xitami/2.5's PHP support goes via CGI, so is much slower than LRWP.

Cheers,
Pieter

Pieter,

and let's not forget that with LRWP the pc running xitami can be different from the one running the LRWP client process, so you can create very neat systems.

Think of having the client which accesses a database on a pc inside your lan behind a firewall and the web server on a pc with direct access from internet (DMZ), since is the LRWP client process which starts the connection to the web server you can have a secure configuration easily, that is, if the webserver is compromised, you still have your data safe behind the firewall.

man you guys do things the hard way!!!!  ;-) such a simpler solution 
exists and I have NO speed issues, mind you I am fibre optic 200mps 
sustained 400 burstable and running about 350 virtual servers.  Xitami 
rox all on its own, do not require any third party stuff like lrwp, just 
php and mysql which is a breeze to setup in Xitami.  Please do not do 
away with the editable text files, please do not make it like Apache!!!

ha, didn't mean to start an LRWP debate.  I was just curious about it cause I have never used it and don't know much about it.  I do recall Xitami having a bug related LRWP when two instances of Xitami are running on the same box.  Even if you disabled LRWP on the second Xitami it still wouldn't start - I believe you had to disable it and change the default LWRP port before getting the second one to run.

Anyway.  What I am curious about now is with all these requests and features coming in:

A) Where do you draw the line on what Xitami 5 will support?  
B) You have your base list of items that you annouced will be in Xitami 5
      b1: What was the estimated development time for that base list?
      b2: What do you expect the development time will be for the extended feature requests?
C) What do you expect Xitami's footprint to be after its completed?  I think everyone is hoping for a highly kick-ass, flexable, secure, easy to use webserver (like all previous vesions of Xitami) that will still be small, light and 1/100th the size of Apache.
D) When do you begin development and when do you expect to have beta versions for the user community to start banging on?

Mainly, Xitami/5 is based on a plugin framework for drivers (e.g. CGI,
LRWP, PHP) and access modules (things like authentication, logging,
etc.).  We'll focus on the framework and things that are complex to
make right, such as virtual hosts, while we hope people will
contribute with drivers and access modules, eventually.

No idea, and I'm not making promises. I expect it will take some time
since it's a ground-up new product, not an upgrade of the old one.
But iMatix is moving back into web products with Zyre, so we have a
business reason to make Xitami a great server.

The server will remain small, efficient, easy to configure, and
kick-ass.  The current debug build is 4MB. and it runs using 1.6% of
my 1GB RAM, and 0% CPU while idle.

At the same time, it's going to be a lot more sophisticated than
Xitami//2.5.  The platform we use is one we made for OpenAMQ, look at
www.openamq.org and if you want to try building it, and running it,
you'll see the kind of flexibility.  E.g. configuration via text
files, or command line.

The core is multithreaded, scales to many cores, but stays very
efficient.  OpenAMQ can do 600,000 messages a second, so we think
Xitami will be fast.  OpenAMQ is very stable (we spent extraordinary
effort in developing ways to write ultrarobust code), and I expect
Xitami to be very stable too.

> D) When do you begin development and when do you expect to have beta

Development has started, and we're releasing code regularly, the next
release is in a week or so.  There is already a version in
OpenAMQ/1.4, if you want to try it.  There is documentation on
http://xitami.wikidot.com.  The code will for the time being be part
of OpenAMQ, but later we'll split Xitami off into a product package of
its own.

Thanks for the interest and feedback.

Hello,

I've been running Xitami (trouble free) for the past six or seven
years (as a service), on a WinXP-Pro (32-bit) machine. However,
concerned about my aging hardware, I recently migrated Xitami to a
newly purchased (remarketed) machine... where I've replicated the
original software environment as closely as possible.

   IBM Type 9210-KUA
   Pentium 4 3.2Ghz HyperThread
   2.0gb DDR2 ram
   500gb Sata hardrive
   WinXP-Pro SP2 (fully patched, WITHOUT IE-7)

   Xitami v2.5c2 (as a service)

This new machine appeared to run flawlessly for the first five days,
at which point it began to hang... in a rather non-responsive kind of
way.

What appears to be a crashed or dead Xitami does not get logged as
such... and Windows continues to report that the service is still
running.  If I attempt to stop the service, that hangs too... and
requires the use of the task-manager to actually take it down.

At that point however, if I attempt to restart the Xitami service, I
get the following error:

   Internet Explorer Script Error
       An Error has occurred in the script on this page.
   Line:    1
   Char:    1
   Error:    Unspecified error
   URL:    res://C:\WINDOWS\System32\mmcndmgr.dll/views.htm

Does anyone know how to make this stop?

Thanks  :)

Sounds like Hardware issues to me, has nothing to do with Xitami.  If 
your system is hanging you need to troubleshoot the hardware.

Hello,

I've been running Xitami (trouble free) for the past six or seven
years (as a service), on a WinXP-Pro (32-bit) machine. However,
concerned about my aging hardware, I recently migrated Xitami to a
newly purchased (remarketed) machine... where I've replicated the
original software environment as closely as possible.

   IBM Type 9210-KUA
   Pentium 4 3.2Ghz HyperThread
   2.0gb DDR2 ram
   500gb Sata hardrive
   WinXP-Pro SP2 (fully patched, WITHOUT IE-7)

   Xitami v2.5c2 (as a service)

This new machine appeared to run flawlessly for the first five days,
at which point it began to hang... in a rather non-responsive kind of
way.

What appears to be a crashed or dead Xitami does not get logged as
such... and Windows continues to report that the service is still
running.  If I attempt to stop the service, that hangs too... and
requires the use of the task-manager to actually take it down.

At that point however, if I attempt to restart the Xitami service, I
get the following error:

   Internet Explorer Script Error
       An Error has occurred in the script on this page.
   Line:    1
   Char:    1
   Error:    Unspecified error
   URL:    res://C:\WINDOWS\System32\mmcndmgr.dll/views.htm

Does anyone know how to make this stop?

Thanks  :)

Ed

This is clearly not a Xitami error but a windows thing.
 
Defective RAM module? 
Replace the memory module with another one or run the server with less memory
 
Corrupt system files?
Typically caused by installing XP and SP2, and then copying the whole config from the old server to the new one
 
It seems windows is tring to run javascript/vbscript
Typically a virus or something like that trying to access internet explorer to do it's thing.
Check the registry (HKLM/.../run HKCU/.../run) and the task manager. Check for new files in the windows/system32 directory

Wow...

Thanks for the reply Hogan, but it's very clear by your response, that I
didn't do a very good job of describing my problem.  My apologies if I've
used bad grammar or terms incorrectly.  This is definitely a
software-related issue, and my guess is that it has something to do with a
minor Windows setting, rather than Xitami itself.  I have little experience
with Intel-based PCs, know absolutely nothing about hyper-thread technology,
and only mentioned the hardware in case there were any known issues.

The Xitami service ran perfectly for the first five days.  After the fifth
day, I became aware of a problem when I clicked a link to one of my domains
and got a "server not found" error.  There was no response from any of my
domains (or WBA) across the web, or locally.  After confirming there were no
firewall issues, I assumed that Xitami-service had crashed, and for some
reason, did not recover.

A visual inspection of the PC Xitami runs on, suggested everything was
running and functioning normally... including all other services and run
programs (dynamic dns client etc.).  I could even use the PC to check email,
or share files across the network (i.e. PC functioning correctly/Xitami
not).

The Xitami quick-start gadget that opens from the Xitami-icon in control
panel, says Xitami is still running at this point (and has one active
connection).  Windows-Services tells me Xitami is running, and no crash
activity has been logged (Xitami's logs), even though Xitami remains
non-responsive.

When I tell Windows-Services to stop Xitami, it goes into "stopping mode",
but never actually completes the stop-action... even after 20 minutes of
waiting.  Eventually, the task manager is required to actually get Xitami
stopped.

If I try to restart the Xitami-service, this error message immediately
appears on my screen:

   Internet Explorer Script Error
       An Error has occurred in the script on this page.
   Line:    1
   Char:    1
   Error:    Unspecified error
   URL:    res://C:\WINDOWS\System32\mmcndmgr.dll/views.htm

(even though everything else running on this PC is still functioning
normally)

If I reboot the PC, Xitami comes back strong and hard and full of life, and
does everything Xitami is supposed to do, and very well.  Within 14 or 15
hours however, Xitami is back to being non-responsive again, and repeats the
exact same scenario I've just described.

My guess, is that I would probably have no problems at all, if I just
disabled the service and ran the Xitami GUI at startup.  Which is exactly
what I'm about to try, the moment this message is sent.

Sounds a lot like a problem I had about a year ago, that started happening shortly after I updated my chip-set and network card drivers. Not sure if one would have anything to do with the other, but the new drivers were really the only thing that had changed, making it the most logical place to start troubleshooting.

I completely removed the Xitami service, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, rebooted, then reinstalled the Xitami service, LAST. The problem hasn't happened since.

Hi,

We have used Xitami as an embedded webserver in conjunction with our
LRWP application for many years. One customer has 90 or so sites.  This
morning, on approximately 30 of those Xitami was found locked up.  In
some cases restarting Xitami would fix it, but in some cases the
computers were just rebooted. Attached is an entry from the Windows
event log. I know that if a program does not provide a dll to get the
message from, it won't display a specific message in the event log, but
just thought I'd throw this out to see if anyone has any ideas. This is
the customer for which we found that leaving the Xitami control panel
open helped keep it from locking up. Why, I have no idea. I only noticed
that when the server was locked up and a browser was waiting on it, when
the control panel was opened, it completed the request. Now I'm told by
the customer that keeping the control applet open helps keep it running
for a few days but not indefinitely.  Also, we found abnormally large
memtrace.txt files on the systems that crashed, so we got the source,
built it and deployed that version. 

Has anyone seen Xitami lock ups like this?

Great, that's what I was hoping. No sense in going backwards. In the
meantime though. I have to see if there's anything I can do to keep
Xitami running on my customers sites. 

I have enabled debug logging a different site that crashed. It's the
service version of 2.4 d11, and one we built ourselves from the source.
I also got a crash log. I attached it. If it won't go through the list,
I will post it directly in an email.

Built yourself???  I would be looking into that one.  As far as I am

problems, plus I have set it up on numerous machines over numerous years 
and NEVER have a problem.

There are known crashes in the old socket layer, which we could not
reproduce and fix.  This looks like one of them, not caused by
recompiling Xitami.

Good question.  We could not reproduce these crashes either.  But they
were reported by various people, so they are real.  Could be random
timing, or the code trying to access unallocated memory that is 'ok'
most times, and garbage just now and then.

There are always lots of reasons why bugs don't happen systematically,
unfortunately the only way to solve them is to understand why they
_do_ happen, which can be pretty hard.

Since we have been using Xitami back in the os/2 days, we have had very
few problems reported, but for this particular customer, on his network,
it happens very frequently. I had another one go down right after I
wrote my last email. It happened right when I tried to access it. While
these systems do see quite a bit of network activity since video files
are being transferred to them overnight, the one that just crashed had
no other activity going on at the time.

Good question.  We could not reproduce these crashes either.  But they
were reported by various people, so they are real.  Could be random
timing, or the code trying to access unallocated memory that is 'ok'
most times, and garbage just now and then.

There are always lots of reasons why bugs don't happen systematically,
unfortunately the only way to solve them is to understand why they _do_
happen, which can be pretty hard.

What year did Xitami come out, I think I originally set it up back in 
1992 or 3???  Since the begining I have never had a crash with Xitami 
and I Virtual host over 300 domains.  The only thing I never used was 
the FTP modual, back in the day I used to run WarFTP, now I use ability 
FTP Daemon and all works GREAT!

Yes '96 I remember that and tried it with some success, I ran IIS as well [then I was so amazed I wrote the unofficial guide to networking and hosting your own ftp download site using?] You guess right! X-server. XUG was a big hit. Never got permission to do this online so I distributed it to all of my clients in person as the COO of WindyHill Group Internet, a hosting service using early Linux distros for SOHO and start ups, they [my clientsw]were amazed that I would do this, but who really wants to just sit on such a good thing, Zack Frandsen and other Web Geniuses in Frederick also used Xitami for ther personal sites because I turned them on to it in 1997...

Maybe its a tWinDoze memory allocation issue, try using Warp5 EcomStation... I'm no betting man but this would be hard to beat for a crash free environment/Distro, with any chipset, esp. works well with the old Netfinity Servers 5500-7700. WSeb is great with Xitami too! You cannot find a better product (*though complex) than WebSphere which is deployed more for critical e-commerce transactions where security is profound, SSL. 

I do not use it for commerce but it is nice to use as a platform for any webserver even if there is little use for all the other features IBM built into it. I like Xitami/IBM for Multi-homing.

Are you running Internet Explorer 5 6 7 or 8? The smarter the browser the bigger the holes, your cache maybe poisoned, your local dns may also be...Hackers are having fun with MS. -its so easy to thrash new generation MS browsers and MS Office using port 80/ could you try other ports? Other Browsers or use OPEN OFFICE. Vista is flukey with Xitami as well, I run Xitami on ebay auctions without a hitch, hosting all my images beyond the free one.

I tried the old pro once, offered as an outdated version but I never tried it online, just curious for local tests. For online service I used the various flavors from first to last with no glitches whatsoever-the subscription service version tested by WHGIS was not much different, functionally that is for what was needed than any "normal" flavour for personal use, SSL notwithstanding. Now at this most sentient juncture, in the apps history the questions is: will 'X5' be offered for/as totally free or will there also be an exclusive "pay for" ver.?

Xitamin is for users not losers! [like Aapache which is the most used and abused webserver since it can be so easily hacked!]

X5 uses the Apache APR library for non-portable functions and that
works on OS/2 according to the docs.  There will be some porting
needed I think, but not a lot.

a logo, that's the place to go.

Hi,

I'm playing around with logos.  I know, we should be writing code for
X5... but hey... here is a quick & dirty attempt.  Nice logs make
projects more fun.

We've opened a logo competition on facebook, join the group X5 and post yours.

:-)  I don't know about "sewer", it seems a simple way to keep in
touch with people.

OK, if you don't want to use Facebook, upload the logo to the
xitami.wikidot.com wiki.

This reminds me of the "here is a spider I drew, I trust this is
sufficient to settle my account" story.
(http://www.27bslash6.com/overdue.html)

Themes?  IMO it would be nice to combine "X" and "5" in a nice design,
but that's just one view.  Any logo has to be very simple, anyhow.

Anything sent by email is guaranteed to be forgotten, so if you want
people to see your work, either use the Facebook group, or the Xitami
wiki.
