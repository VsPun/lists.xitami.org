<PRE>Hello,,,,  :) :)

Recently Microsoft provided a critical/security update for Window98SE, XT, etc.
The one in question is:   KB891711 [a fix related to ICON vulnerability(???), I think!]

This was installed on severzal W98SE systems and all seemed to be OK on systems that were not running Xitami. The computer with Xitami (W98SE) became unstable and crashed at random, unpredictable times during the day with GPFs at several different places---most of these were reported at:

             GPF in module USER.EXE at 0012:00000167

Information from the Internet (Search string : 891711) indicates this process has presented various problems. The KB891711 was installed as a running process and started after each boot.  MSCONFIG was used to prevent the process from starting at boot on the machine with Xitami and all is now stable.

It has been several weeks since this upgrade and only the noted problems found from Internet searches can still be found. Also, no comment from Microsoft that I can find.

Anyone else with this experience and/or information about a new method for this security upgrade?

Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!  :) :)

Jerry
