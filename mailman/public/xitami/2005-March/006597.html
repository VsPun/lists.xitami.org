<PRE>Ok I asked this and it ended up as a reply on another question.

I use PHP almost exclusively and one of the problems with PHP and dynamic
web pages for search engines is the question mark. For others it's urls with
long strings (more than 3 arguments).  Some of the search engines (Google
for instance) will stop at the &quot;?&quot;. Although Google says they don't. Google
does say however that they will not index long urls, including urls with
date or session strings. SEO's get around this in Apache with a thing called
Mod_rewrite and .htaccess, I don't use Apache so I have no idea how it
works.

So is there a way for Xitami to re-write a url? Maybe in the Filter area?

Example:  stuff.html =
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20050321140922470"">http://www.mydomain.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20050321140922470&quot;</A>

Ideas? Suggestions?

I do have a php solution that requires a new static page for each dynamic
page, but that to me defeats the purpose of having a dynamic website. Unless
I can figure out how to do it on the fly.

Ron
