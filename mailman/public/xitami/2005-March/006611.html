<PRE>Oh it can use dynamic dns service like no-ip. Well I'll be testing it out
next week. My main purpose is to put a backup of a company website that I
administer on it then send it to the company. But when I saw it, it got me
thinking that xitami could do that too.

What's the point of having one?  You would have to drag your DNS around
with you too.  I guess it would be useful for local development purposes
and then sync with the main server for vacations and trips, but not much
beyond that...especially with wireless being (more or less) ubiquitous.

That said, the Xitami GUI (non-service) will work just fine as-is and
hardly uses any space on any drive - basically leaving 126MB of space for
content.  I don't know if it would work, but you might be able to write an
&quot;autorun.inf&quot; file that runs the main Xitami executable when the stick is
inserted.  Xitami might crash on eject, though (if it was still running
just before ejecting).
