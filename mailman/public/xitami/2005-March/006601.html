<PRE>Hello Gary,,,,and others :) :)

And, THANKS for the comments.

The comments that were found on the Internet suggested this might be the case even for my environment. But, it was strange to see only the Xitami computer to become instable in my case!!! I would have thought that all would become instable(???),,,just as Gary's environment...........OH WELL!! :) :)

And, this is in no way is to place Xitami at the root of the instability,,,,,Xitami runs GREAT.

However in my case it was only the Xitami machine with W98SE that became unstable. The &quot;action and reaction effect&quot; seems to point to the 891711 process as being the culprit causing the instability. 

After several weeks of Internet searches I could not find other comments that would define &quot;why&quot; or any &quot;solution&quot;. My searches are probably lacking for the correct string or phrase,,,simply using the string 891711 plus adding phrases resulted in finding no &quot;solution&quot;.

So, I was wondering if anyone in this forum has found anything further about this situation and perhaps a &quot;solution&quot;.


The following lists further details of this environment related to the instability caused by the 891711 process and the Xitami computer.

In the beginning all systems with W98SE were low-level formatted, set for FAT32, and then W98SE was installed on all. Also, all machines include the same applications packages and use. In this environment only two applications were installed. Both are the same version of Word and Excel from Microsoft and are used strictly for office management. And, all are loaded with the same network settings, drivers, etc. 

In this case there are 10 computers on the LAN and one is Windows XP HOME edition. All others are W98SE with one using Xitami. All machines have been upgraded with all the Microsoft Windows critical/security upgrades available for these operating systems. As well as the 891711 upgrade.

The Xitami W98SE computer is stript down and has no other applications being used, even the Accessories were all removed, no games, no scheduled tasks, etc. It is strictly used as an Xitami type Server. No SSH, Cygwin, etc. type software is loaded to the Xitami (W98SE) computer.
And, noone uses this computer during daily activities.

It was only this Xitami computer that the 891711 process was causing the instability based on &quot;action and reaction effect&quot;,,,all other machines are happily running the 891711 process.

Thanks for any further information, time, and advise!!!!  :) :)

Jerry

&gt;<i> I have 4 systems running Win98SE, one of them runs Xitami. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't experience any issues with Xitami itself, but all of the systems 
</I>&gt;<i> became unstable; random crashes mostly (sometimes a blue screen, sometimes 
</I>&gt;<i> a reboot). Turning off KB891711 fixed it on all of the machines. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It may be an interaction with something else that's not well behaved, 
</I>&gt;<i> though it's hard to believe since the 4 systems have little in common 
</I>&gt;<i> besides Win98. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, removing the &quot;patch&quot; removed the problem.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hello,,,, :) :) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Recently Microsoft provided a critical/security update for Window98SE, XT, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The one in question is: KB891711 [a fix related to ICON 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;vulnerability(???), I think!] 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This was installed on severzal W98SE systems and all seemed to be OK on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;systems that were not running Xitami. The computer with Xitami (W98SE) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;became unstable and crashed at random, unpredictable times during the day 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;with GPFs at several different places---most of these were reported at: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GPF in module USER.EXE at 0012:00000167 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Information from the Internet (Search string : 891711) indicates this 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;process has presented various problems. The KB891711 was installed as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;running process and started after each boot. MSCONFIG was used to prevent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the process from starting at boot on the machine with Xitami and all is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;now stable. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It has been several weeks since this upgrade and only the noted problems 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;found from Internet searches can still be found. Also, no comment from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Microsoft that I can find. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Anyone else with this experience and/or information about a new method for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;this security upgrade? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!! :) :)
