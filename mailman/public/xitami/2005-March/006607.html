<PRE>Hello Charles,,,and others :) :)

Thanks for the comment,,,and the last search I did was several days previous to last Friday.
Using your link for additional information to form other google searches has found several articles about the Microsoft Announcement made by Jerry Bryant related to 891711 in some Microsoft Newsgroups.

And, yep,,,,it is there!!! Below is that announcement:

*********************Start of Announcement****************************************** 
Subject: MS05-002 on 9x and ME   3/25/2005 11:08 PM PST 
 
By:    Jerry Bryant [MSFT]  In:    microsoft.public.security,
                                   microsoft.public.win95.general.discussion,
                                   microsoft.public.win98.gen_discussion, 
                                   microsoft.public.windowsme.general

******************************End of Announcement***************************************

So, it is now wait and watch for a correction! Here is hoping this situation can be corrected in an operating system type file rather than a running process(???) !!!!

For those that would like to review a Microsoft newsgroup that the announcement can be found plus several replies to the announcement try the following:

  www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx

          Then elect +ENGLISH
             Then select +Windows9x
                   Then select Windows 98 General

The &quot;search for&quot; window was set with &quot;jerry bryant&quot; and the &quot;search in&quot; was set to &quot;Windows 98&quot;.

The subject of &quot;MS05-002 on 9x and ME&quot; had 90 (plus) entries and the article by Jerry Bryant was the first one listed.

THANKS to all for your comments, time, and advise!!!   :) :)

Jerry
