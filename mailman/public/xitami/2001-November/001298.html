<PRE>Looking at the source code, it seems to be a debug file the iMatix Standard 
Function Library generates while exiting if it discovers a memory leak (the 
programmers at iMatix are very careful about memory leaks, which is 
probably why Xitami takes up so little memory... many programs leak memory 
quite badly, which is why you need to restart them and/or Windows so often).

It should never be generated; the fact that it has means something broke. 
I'm sure it shouldn't be as large as 8GB though... how long had Xitami been 
running for?

I'm not sure how to avoid it. Creating a read-only file called memtrace.lst 
might possibly block Xitami from writing it (the name is hard-coded, it 
won't try other names like it does with the logfiles).

to iMatix programmers
=====================

Should mem_assert even be enabled in a production build? sflmem.h seems to 
define it even when DEBUG isn't #defined - shouldn't it be an abort or even 
a no-op outside debug mode, rather than generating a huge log before it 
aborts?
It appears it's only called just before exit, anyway.
