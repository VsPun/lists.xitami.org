<PRE>The only feature I have not been able to implement with Xitami using the TZO
client is FTP. I was trying to get the integrated DDNS function in Xitami to
work only because I thought it might resolve my FTP problem. Perhaps my real
problem with FTP is that I am also behind a router? Any help you could give
me with that issue, Stephen, -or anyone else-, would be greatly appreciated.

ROUTER ISSUE:

My machine, like Stephen's machine, is part of a netork, but only a small
one consisting of my machine and another machine used to play occassional
two-player games. All unsolicited internet traffic is routed to my main
machine - as determined by a setting in the router software. Can anyone
suggest a reason why the Xitami web server works to serve web pages to
people outside my network, but won't work to serve FTP? The TZO tech support
people have been nice, but unable to help with this, suggesting that the
problem may be my Xitami settings. They say that their FTP client keeps
getting 192.168.1.2 as my machine's IP address (my machine's local IP) when
they hit my site (when the TZO client is running), instead of the dynamic
address assigned by my ISP.

I have read everything I can about my router, but have found no obvious
settings which would tell it to treat FTP traffic in a certain way. The
router is a 3Com router and is configured via a web page interface, so the
emphasis of the router software is on keeping things simple. I was concerned
that the router wasn't designed to do what I'm doing in mind, but the good
news is that I have found that I can telnet to my router's IP address, and
that there are many &quot;unimplemented&quot; text commands that can change the
router's settings, if necessary. I would obviously rather run just Xitami if
possible, rather than Xitami and the TZO client.

DDNS ISSUE:

The router may be the ultimate solution to my problem, but even so, it does
not explain why the Xitami DDNS feature is not working with TZO, or explain
the rather cryptic error messages I am getting from Xitami. I am still
curious about that. I don't think this feature is well implemented.

DNS SERVER:

Thanks, Stephen, for the suggestion about <A HREF="http://www.jhsoft.com/.">http://www.jhsoft.com/.</A> I reviewed
the pages there, but don't think this is an issue for me. As I understand
it, a DNS server would be something I would be interested in if I had a lot
of machines on my side of the router, right? My current network setting in
Windows ME is &quot;DNS disabled.&quot;

TESTING MY OWN WEB PAGE/FTP PAGE:

Finally, someone told me that, because I was behind a router, I simply
cannot visit my own machine through the internet. In other words, although I
can hit <A HREF="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</A> or &quot;trick&quot; my machine into taking me to my own
web page by mapping my domain to this IP through the &quot;hosts&quot; file, there is
no way for me to test my site as people on the other side of the router
would see it. This has been very frustrating because Xitami works
beautifully on this side of the router. It's only when I get involved in the
dynamic IP stuff that things don't work.

I've been playing with this for more than 3 weeks now with almost no luck.
It's been really frustrating, so I REALLY appreciate any help I get on this.
The thing that has me most confused is that the Web pages serve, the FTP
won't. What gives?

Thanks.

-Carl.

Carl my IP address is dynamic also.  I am also using TZO to resolve the
dynamic IP issue and have been successful in running Xitami behind a
router.  I never bothered to setup the DDNS feature in Xitami since I am
already running the TZO client on my server.  Since I am on a network and
behind a router I am also using a DNS server which allows me to
access &quot;MYDomain.com&quot; from any pc on my network.  &quot;Simple DNS' located at
<A HREF="http://www.jhsoft.com/">http://www.jhsoft.com/</A> offers a solution for this, remember also that if
you're using a router you will have to map port 80 to the machine that
you're running Xitami on.

Stephen.

&gt;<i> I am using xitami v2.5b4 and have had no luck getting the DDNS feature
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> work. Is anyone using this that might be able to lend a hand? I am
</I>&gt;<i> using
</I>&gt;<i> TZO.com and have not been able to get the server to connect to TZO's
</I>&gt;<i> machine
</I>&gt;<i> and retreive my dynamic IP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The configuration page in Xitami gives me the &quot;In progress... check
</I>&gt;<i> console
</I>&gt;<i> messages&quot; response whenever I try to sign on. In the message section, I
</I>&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;<i> the following log entries:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: sending DDNS sign-on
</I>&gt;<i> 2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: 'localhost': HTTP/1.1 404 Not found
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also have noticed that I can't get the console to keep my settings.
</I>&gt;<i> They
</I>&gt;<i> return to the default settings whenever I leave the DDNS page, even if
</I>&gt;<i> I hit
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;save&quot; button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.
