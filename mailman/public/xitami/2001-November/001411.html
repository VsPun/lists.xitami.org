<PRE>What are you using for router, box, or internet connection sharing?

Subject: RE: [Xitami] Dynamic IP... is anyone else using it?


&gt;<i> The only feature I have not been able to implement with Xitami using the
</I>TZO
&gt;<i> client is FTP. I was trying to get the integrated DDNS function in Xitami
</I>to
&gt;<i> work only because I thought it might resolve my FTP problem. Perhaps my
</I>real
&gt;<i> problem with FTP is that I am also behind a router? Any help you could
</I>give
&gt;<i> me with that issue, Stephen, -or anyone else-, would be greatly
</I>appreciated.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ROUTER ISSUE:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My machine, like Stephen's machine, is part of a netork, but only a small
</I>&gt;<i> one consisting of my machine and another machine used to play occassional
</I>&gt;<i> two-player games. All unsolicited internet traffic is routed to my main
</I>&gt;<i> machine - as determined by a setting in the router software. Can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> suggest a reason why the Xitami web server works to serve web pages to
</I>&gt;<i> people outside my network, but won't work to serve FTP? The TZO tech
</I>support
&gt;<i> people have been nice, but unable to help with this, suggesting that the
</I>&gt;<i> problem may be my Xitami settings. They say that their FTP client keeps
</I>&gt;<i> getting 192.168.1.2 as my machine's IP address (my machine's local IP)
</I>when
&gt;<i> they hit my site (when the TZO client is running), instead of the dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> address assigned by my ISP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have read everything I can about my router, but have found no obvious
</I>&gt;<i> settings which would tell it to treat FTP traffic in a certain way. The
</I>&gt;<i> router is a 3Com router and is configured via a web page interface, so the
</I>&gt;<i> emphasis of the router software is on keeping things simple. I was
</I>concerned
&gt;<i> that the router wasn't designed to do what I'm doing in mind, but the good
</I>&gt;<i> news is that I have found that I can telnet to my router's IP address, and
</I>&gt;<i> that there are many &quot;unimplemented&quot; text commands that can change the
</I>&gt;<i> router's settings, if necessary. I would obviously rather run just Xitami
</I>if
&gt;<i> possible, rather than Xitami and the TZO client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DDNS ISSUE:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The router may be the ultimate solution to my problem, but even so, it
</I>does
&gt;<i> not explain why the Xitami DDNS feature is not working with TZO, or
</I>explain
&gt;<i> the rather cryptic error messages I am getting from Xitami. I am still
</I>&gt;<i> curious about that. I don't think this feature is well implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DNS SERVER:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, Stephen, for the suggestion about <A HREF="http://www.jhsoft.com/.">http://www.jhsoft.com/.</A> I
</I>reviewed
&gt;<i> the pages there, but don't think this is an issue for me. As I understand
</I>&gt;<i> it, a DNS server would be something I would be interested in if I had a
</I>lot
&gt;<i> of machines on my side of the router, right? My current network setting in
</I>&gt;<i> Windows ME is &quot;DNS disabled.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TESTING MY OWN WEB PAGE/FTP PAGE:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, someone told me that, because I was behind a router, I simply
</I>&gt;<i> cannot visit my own machine through the internet. In other words, although
</I>I
&gt;<i> can hit <A HREF="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</A> or &quot;trick&quot; my machine into taking me to my own
</I>&gt;<i> web page by mapping my domain to this IP through the &quot;hosts&quot; file, there
</I>is
&gt;<i> no way for me to test my site as people on the other side of the router
</I>&gt;<i> would see it. This has been very frustrating because Xitami works
</I>&gt;<i> beautifully on this side of the router. It's only when I get involved in
</I>the
&gt;<i> dynamic IP stuff that things don't work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been playing with this for more than 3 weeks now with almost no luck.
</I>&gt;<i> It's been really frustrating, so I REALLY appreciate any help I get on
</I>this.
&gt;<i> The thing that has me most confused is that the Web pages serve, the FTP
</I>&gt;<i> won't. What gives?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Carl.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Carl my IP address is dynamic also.  I am also using TZO to resolve the
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic IP issue and have been successful in running Xitami behind a
</I>&gt;<i> router.  I never bothered to setup the DDNS feature in Xitami since I am
</I>&gt;<i> already running the TZO client on my server.  Since I am on a network and
</I>&gt;<i> behind a router I am also using a DNS server which allows me to
</I>&gt;<i> access &quot;MYDomain.com&quot; from any pc on my network.  &quot;Simple DNS' located at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.jhsoft.com/">http://www.jhsoft.com/</A> offers a solution for this, remember also that if
</I>&gt;<i> you're using a router you will have to map port 80 to the machine that
</I>&gt;<i> you're running Xitami on.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am using xitami v2.5b4 and have had no luck getting the DDNS feature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work. Is anyone using this that might be able to lend a hand? I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TZO.com and have not been able to get the server to connect to TZO's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and retreive my dynamic IP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The configuration page in Xitami gives me the &quot;In progress... check
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; console
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages&quot; response whenever I try to sign on. In the message section, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the following log entries:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: sending DDNS sign-on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: 'localhost': HTTP/1.1 404 Not found
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also have noticed that I can't get the console to keep my settings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; return to the default settings whenever I leave the DDNS page, even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the &quot;save&quot; button.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -Carl.
