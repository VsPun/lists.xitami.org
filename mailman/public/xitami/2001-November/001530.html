<PRE>Hi Folks,

Well it appears that the Xitami mailing list got rather upset at someone
mentioning there was a problem with Xitami, and decided to retailiate :-)
(For those that missed out, it started sending out copy after copy after
copy after... of the same message Bernd Luevelsmeyer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bdluevel@heitec.net">bdluevel@heitec.net</A>&gt;
conerning a post to the Bugtraq mailing list about Xitami.)

Seriously, it appears that the mailing list software that we're using
and the iMatix mail server had a violent disagrement about the meaning
of a error message, which led the mailing list software to keep resending
the same message over and over again, even though the mail server
already had plenty of copies of the message which it was going to send
out real soon now and was just trying to say it wasn't going to be able
to send it immediately.

I _think_ I've found the original cause of the problem and put something
in place to stop it happening again, but I'm not sure why it would have
caused the behaviour to happen so unfortunately I'm not 100% certain
I've fixed the problem yet.

My apologies to everyone who got 5, 15, 30, or more copies of the same
message in their mailbox from the Xitami list.  I stopped as many as I
could (there were up to 100 more waiting to be sent out), but I've
received about 30 of them, and I think a few others got more.

Ewen
