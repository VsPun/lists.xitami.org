<PRE>Hi all:

Ok, is anyone interested in helping to develop a control panel type application in
PHP for Xitami?

Here's the situation, I currently run 5 domains + 15 sub domains on my xitami
server. Managing these have become cumbersome and creating new ones are not much
easier ( I often have to directly edit the defaults.cfg file). Also if you want to
allow people to manage they're own domains/subdomains as well as do checks on
billing and what not then it becomes equally difficult since xitami doesn't support
these features.

I would like to start developing a PHP driven applet (perhaps with mysql as a
backup for additional information) to replace the current web administration
system. I am also thinking of adding such features as management for php and mysql
databases and perhaps even future billing systems.

Anyhow, before I start, would anyone be interested in this when I'm done, or
perhaps would be interested in helping me develop this system. It would primarily
be for Xitami on the windows platform but I'm sure I could make it more modular in
the future.

-Evan
