<PRE>
Scott,

The 'php returns a blank page' comment is a dead give away - this is usually
because php.exe loads but is unable to load php4ts.dll. The most common solution
is to put php.exe and php4ts.dll into the xitami directory. This appears however
to be problematic with aliases. The solution for my problem was to place an
entry in the  system path that points to the php directory instead of moving the
php exe and dll. I also experimented with placing the dll in the winnt\system32
directory.

I think this will solve your questions 1 &amp; 2.

If you wish to run Xitami with a particular account. Install Xitami as a
service. Then open the services control applet and open the service editor and
set the account name and password to run the service - this is standard windows
NT/2000 stuff.

Best of luck

Paul

Subject:  [Xitami] Issues/questions with 2.5b5



Greetings -
I'm in the process of migrating my own domain off if IIS/ASP/Access and onto
Xitami/PHP/MySQL.  My server platform will remain win2k server.  So far I have
all three
working but I've hit some isues with Xitami that I have not found resolutions
for.
I cannot for the life of me get PHP to work in an aliased director. I have tried
using
straight php and I get blank pages returned.  I tried XiFusion and it generated
the error message
&quot;Cannot spawn child process&quot;.  So my questions are:
1. Can Xitami support PHP using aliases.
2. Can Xitami support PHP using DNS based vitual hosting (I need to host 3
domains on one IP address)
3. Recomendations on how to run Xitami so it is not running as the system
account.  Just create a basic user like IIS does and give
that user access to only my WWW directories?

Thanks for any help and sory if these are repeats.  I'm new to the list and I
could not find a way to seach the archives for answers.
