Are you SURE you want to do this?

If you set aliasses like
     DDD = &quot;d:/&quot;
where D: is the drive that Xitami is instaleld on then you are asking 
someone to look at <A HREF="http://hostname/DDD/Xitami/defaults.cfg">http://hostname/DDD/Xitami/defaults.cfg</A> and 
<A HREF="http://hostname/DDD/Xitami/defaults.aut">http://hostname/DDD/Xitami/defaults.aut</A> which means that you will show 
the world your configuration settings. If you've been really sloppy and 
allowed FTP to see http aliases then someone could put a trojan in place 
of your webserver by doing put <A HREF="ftp://hostname/DDD/Xitami/Xiwin32.exe">ftp://hostname/DDD/Xitami/Xiwin32.exe</A> 
trojan.exe

I don't want to be alarmist here but what Xitami is doing here is makign 
sure that you don't accidentally open up a huge security hole. This is 
GOOD and you really need to think about whether you actually want that 
hole to exist before trying to work around it!

BTW if Xitami is in C:\xitami and you share d:\ where d:\ is where you 
installed Win2k/XP thats still not the smartest thing to do since that 
allows people to see d:\winnt which has a lot of interesting information 
in it and again the potential for someone to upload a trojan exists.
