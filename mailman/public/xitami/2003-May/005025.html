<PRE>&gt;<i> it looks like this list is Windows-centric,
</I>
No, the WORLD is windows-centric, and especially the world of small
free webservers, just because the world is littered with Windows
boxes. (Xitami is one of the few things you can put on a 386SX/16 PC
and make it usable today.)

As for BSD: a lot of BSD people use the Apache that comes in BSD.
Those who don't apparently know enough to install Xitami on BSD,
because I've seen little BSD talk here.

And historically, unix users had to know how to edit configuration
files to get unix up at all; while Windows is all &quot;Click OK&quot;. Xitami
often needs no more than a couple clicks to get going, so is great
for that market.

OS/X is interesting and MUCH newer than Xitami. I can install OS/X
without using a trace of my old unix and hardcore-DOS skills. In
fact it took me an hour to find where Apple hid the command line. So
there would be some interest in &quot;Xitami on X&quot; (what a sales point!)
if it could be packed as a point-and-play binary.

The Imatix company isn't likely to do that. Xitami never brought in
enough cash to keep someone employed, but it and other demos brought
them good custom-work business that keeps them very busy.

Xitami is open source and anybody could gather a community around it
for support and development. Somehow that hasn't happened, perhaps
because Xitami &quot;just works&quot;.

Anyway.... your OS/X comes with Apache, the most popular webserver
on this planet and very solid and well supported. Unless you have
built some Xitami-specific extension you need to run, or are deathly
afraid to edit Apache's CNF files, I don't see any benefit to
Xitami. I have Xitami running on 5 or 6 boxes, and love it, but have
used Apache-Win to work around a script-bug, and work with an
Apache-on-OSX box for another site, and Apache is good stuff. Why
not use what comes pre-installed? (Assuming it isn't trash like MS's
PWS, IIS; or lightweight like Apple's old personal web sharing.)
There is a hell of a lot more community support around Apache than
Xitami, a lot more Apache-tuned tools, and since OSX comes with
Apache it surely has more Mac community support.

&gt;<i> possibly I subscribed to the wrong list.
</I>
There is this list, and there is <A HREF="mailto:xitami-dev@lists.xitami.org">xitami-dev@lists.xitami.org</A> which
is more for code developers. Possibly you will find someone there
who knows what a compiler is (I do but won't admit it). But traffic
is much lighter than this list, hasn't been a post in a month, and I
don't recall OSX ever being discussed there.
