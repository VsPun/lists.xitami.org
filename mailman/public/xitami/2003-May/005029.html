Thanks for the info Paul.  I've been running UNIX systems on big iron 
since AT&amp;T invented System V, so I'm not afraid to edit files.  
Unfortunately, I have never used Windows any great amount so I don't 
know alot about it, and I would consider running Xitami on Windows 2000 
Server for experimentation (although I really wanted it running on my 
laptop with OS X), except we don't own a Wintel box to run Windows on - 
all our hardware is PowerPC, S/390, or SPARC.  And we do use Apache on 
all our XServe's with OS X Server, and it also comes in the workstation 
version of OS X.  But I've always liked Xitami well enough to run on my 
linux and Solaris boxen, sometimes as a lightweight development server 
running on an alternative port, but mostly for experimenting, and even 
at one time in limited light weight production use.  My C/C++ 
programming skills are horrible, and it appears the biggest problem in 
Xitami's source is prelude.h not including code to properly identify 
Darwin and it's UNIX paths so the build can progress, so it halts.  OS 
X identifies itself as Darwin, not a BSD UNIX, even though they are 
similar under the hood.  I suppose I could muck around in there and 
figure it out, but was hoping to find someone who had already done it 
to save me that &quot;mucking around&quot; in the source code to get it to 
compile.
