<PRE>Hi all:

 I've migrated my OS from W2K Pro where I used IIS to XP home which
unfortunately doesn't ship with IIS [ good old Bill ].

 I've heard and seen a lot of good news and hi commendations for Xitami
..so here I am.

 I can get Xitami to run my HTML..no problem.

 I use Alaska xBase++ code compiled to produce a 32 bit CGI exe. It has
worked great under IIS, but now under Xitami, I can't get them to light
up.
 Yes I 've read the help files and they where fine..to a point and I've
done a quick scan of the archives of this group, but nothing expressly
addresses my issues.

 FIRST: The config on the Xitami install doesn't create a CGI-BIN
directory as advertised in the admin and help files. There's a CGI-SRC
though. No big deal I created one. An oversight I thought ?.
 SECOND:
    I loaded my dll's and exe's into this directory [ c:\xitami\cgi-bin
] = 500 error
 so I loaded ........................................[
c:\xitami\webpages\cgi-bin ] = 500 error
 and a few other perms and combs' all with the same result. = 500 error.
  Even tried adding a 'MZ' prefix to the dll's and exe's.. No luck there
either.

 I think someone has to &quot;lead me by the throat&quot; .

 From the default installation..where do I place my code so it will run
?? And any other issue I should know about when running a Windows 32 bit
app as a CGI ?

 Many thanks for the help..
