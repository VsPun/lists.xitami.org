<PRE>At the risk of being redundant, I was checking out an IE security exploit
(from a security site) and found out some disturbing things.

Since I maintain multiple profiles on this Win98SE machine, I don't
generally look in the &quot;Temporary Internet Files&quot; folder in C:\Windows
directory.  Each profile maintains its own Temp Folders and clearing them
from the IE option only clears that set of folders.  However, the corrupted
download files were found in the Windows/Temporary Internet Files folders.
Logging into the &quot;NONE&quot; account (hitting cancel at logon) didn't gain me
access to these folders.  Turns out, this account looks in &quot;Local
Settings/Temporary Internet Files&quot; folders.  It seems IE can store files in
both your current profiles Temp folder and the main one in c:\windows,
depending on who's scripting the code.

So to recap - you can find the &quot;Temporary Internet Files&quot; folder in:
c:\windows - general downloads
c:\windows\local settings - if you use profiles
c:\windows\profiles\(acctname)    - per each profile
in your sock drawer.

You cannot view any other Temp folder in windows but your own.  You will
need to manually clear some of them in DOS - changing the attrib and going
to each random named folder in Content.IE5 and erasing stuff.  I've found
that killing the appropriate &quot;desktop.ini&quot; file allows you to view that
folder's level in window and deleting it will kill everything under it.

Don't know if this helps you.  It bothers me.

Charles

&gt;<i> I have noticed other servers doing something simular but they put the

</I>&gt;<i> tried to download a file that I know I have not tried to download befor

</I>&gt;<i> This appended thing is common my experience from all kinds of sites.
</I>&gt;<i> Haven't figure out why.  Think it has something to do with how IE stores
</I>&gt;<i> the download in the Temporary folders before copying it to where you
</I>&gt;<i> want it. Deleting the brackets doesn't seem to hurt anything.  It's not
</I>&gt;<i> consistent enough to catch the pattern.  Possibility may be downloading
</I>&gt;<i> a file with a duplicate name in the Temp folders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just a thought
