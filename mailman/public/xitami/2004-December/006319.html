Says the oh-so-savvy computer user that:
    1) top-posts an answer above the original quoted material;
    2) does do in both plain ASCII *and* HTML, when the original poster
    at least had had the courtesy of eliminating *that* particular
    Microsoft abomination;
    3) Has the temerity to include a binary:

</I>    background to the latter post.
    
I would suggest removing the beam from thine own eye.

Moreover, with what are you suggesting that the inquirer replace XP/SP2?

Surely he is unable to make the transition to a real[1] operating system
all that easily?  Or were you suggesting removal of the SP2 fix-pack?  If
he did this, his system would be vulnerable (read: FAR FAR MORE
vulnerable than it is at present) to any of the many exploits
circulating.  Are you unaware that a vanilla-installation of XP cannot be
connected to the Internet for more than a few minutes (under ten, and a
few seconds in some environments) without being exploited by many of the
viral worms circulating?  At least having SP2 present avoids a lot of
that infestation.

[1] OTOH, if the original poster is prepared to ditch Windoze, then
eComStation &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ecomstation.com/">http://www.ecomstation.com/</A>&gt; provides a viable alternative,
that is totally unaffected by any anti-Windows malware.  Xitami runs
under this (use the OS/2 version).

   &quot;I don't use Linux. I prefer to use an OS supported by a large multi-
   national vendor, with a good office suite, excellent network/internet
   software and decent hardware support.&quot;
