<PRE>&gt;<i> I am running the latest version of Xitami, but it keeps on crashing with

I am also having this problem!! Xitami used to be as stable as a rock. I
believe I used to run 2.4d5. I upgraded to the newest beta, had crashing
problems. Un-installed that, and installed 2.4d9, and still have crashing
problems.
I am running a sever-only machine with Win2k and all the latest patches,
behind a ZoneAlarm Pro firewall with WWW, FTP and DNS ports open.
Xitami runs for anywhere between 2 hours, and 4 days before crashing. I have
not been able to find anything consistent in debug logs.
It simply dies, while leaving the tray icon, which of course disappears as
soon as you move your mouse over it.
Lately, it has been crashing with a C++ runtime error message window.

So should I fall back to 2.4d5 and forgo the DOS patch? Is it actually that
2.4d9 is unstable? Or did the Beta install leave behind something?

Thanks for any insights you can give to this costly problem.

Tom
