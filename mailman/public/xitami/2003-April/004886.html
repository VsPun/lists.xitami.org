<PRE>Hi,

If you're on WinNT or Win2k just use the NT service version! It is much more
stable. And there no need for logging on as a user in order to run your
webserver. An you can choose to reboot your computer when the server service
crashes, or use a script that boots it regularly, say once a month, and...
and... it works much better trust me.

&gt;<i> It simply dies, while leaving the tray icon, which of course disappears as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as you move your mouse over it.
</I>Well, there's not going to be a tray icon anymore. But if you want to manage
your computer remotely, through a SSH link what is the use of a tray icon
anyway.

Good luck.
SP
