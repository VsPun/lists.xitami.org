Thanks in advance

I investigated this a while ago - but didn't come up with any answers.

Eventually I figured that if was going to go to the trouble of blocking
certain IP addresses from the webserver - then I'd probably also want to
kill off access to any other services too (POP/SMTP/etc). I ended up just
configuring the Cisco router to deny any inbound traffic instead from the
specified IP's.
