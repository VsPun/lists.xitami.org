<PRE>As you will have seen by now, the Xitami mailing list has been moved
from its old home at ec-computers.net (run by Scott Drake) to a mailing
list server at iMatix HQ (lists.xitami.org).  (The Xitami-Dev mailing
list has also been moved to lists.xitami.org; it was moved late last
week.)

We'd like to thank Scott Drake a great deal for hosting all of the
Xitami lists so well for so many years; it has been a great service.

The new mailing list system is running Mailman which provides a web
interface for subscribing/unsubscribing/changing your preferences at:

<A HREF="http://lists.xitami.org./mailman/listinfo/xitami">http://lists.xitami.org./mailman/listinfo/xitami</A>

We have tried to ensure that all users who were getting the &quot;digest&quot;
form of the mailing list are getting the digest form again; and all
those getting the standard form are getting the standard form.  The user
list was transfered over yesterday so should be basically up to date.
In addition Scott Drake has agreed to forward the old ec-computers.net
addresses to the new server for a little while to help with transition
-- thanks Scott.

If you'd like to change your preferences, subscribe or unsubscribe,
please visit the webpage listed above.  You'll need your passsword to
access it: you can ask Mailman to mail this out to you by entering your
email address.  If you have any problems get in touch with me directly
(&lt;<A HREF="mailto:ewen@imatix.com">ewen@imatix.com</A>&gt;).

You can also access the archives of the &quot;new&quot; list from that webpage.
We'll see if something can be done to make sure the old archives are
also available at least for a while.

Ewen
