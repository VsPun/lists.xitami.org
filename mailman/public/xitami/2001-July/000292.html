Hi Paul:

Many thanks for your attempts to help but to no avail.  I still can't 
setup virtual hosting on my system.

Quick Review: am a website designer, want to use Xitami to &quot;host&quot; 
the &quot;works in progress&quot; on my own personal computer so I can test a 
&quot;site in action&quot;, including SSI, Perl, PHP and absolute paths.

&gt;<i> You probably have a text file called &quot;hosts&quot;.
</I>
Actually, I have a HOSTS.SAM and a LMHOSTS.SAM.  Because I have 
seen some reference to renaming the HOSTS.SAM to simply HOSTS, 
I did that too but your instructions below continued to fail.

&gt;<i> It looks something like this: 
</I>&gt;<i> # This is a sample HOSTS file ...
</I>&gt;<i> #  102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com      # source server
</I>&gt;<i> 127.0.0.1       localhost
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If typing &quot;localhost&quot; at your browser opens your page at
</I>&gt;<i> 127.0.0.1, you have a hosts file somewhere (and that's why it
</I>&gt;<i> works). Anything on a line after &quot;#&quot; is ignored. 
</I>
Yes, once I started up Xitami, I typed &quot;localhost&quot; in my browser and I 
got the Xitami documentation that is on my system.  I also typed 
127.0.0.1 and the same result.  Pinging both 127.0.0.1 and localhost 
resulted in positive results.

&gt;<i> Add some lines like 
</I>&gt;<i> 127.0.0.1 manny
</I>&gt;<i> 127.0.0.1 moe
</I>&gt;<i> 127.0.0.1 jack
</I>&gt;<i> Save the file. 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, typing &quot;manny&quot; at your browser should open your default
</I>&gt;<i> 127.0.0.1 page.
</I>
Didn't!  This may be where the instructions fail but I continued along 
with the rest of your suggestions anyway.

&gt;<i> Now go into Xitami's Vhost settings and tell it that &quot;manny&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> points to a CFG file called &quot;manny.cfg&quot;. In manny.cfg, point to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;O:/WebSites/mndm&quot; as the root of the web pages for that host. Do the
</I>&gt;<i> same for moe and jack, except point to your other web-root folders. 
</I>
Given the suggestion of yours below that since I had originally 
installed Xitami on H:\Xitami and the webpages for stc are at 
O:\Websites\stc, I then uninstalled Xitamin and reinstalled it in 
O:\Xitami and moved the stc webpages to 
O:\Xitami\webpages\stc\public_html\.

&gt;<i> Now typing manny, moe, or jack at your browser should open three
</I>&gt;<i> different web sites. 
</I>
No luck

&gt;<i> You -may- still have trouble with your TCP stack not believing
</I>&gt;<i> the hosts file and going to the modem to ask a &quot;real DNS&quot;. MS TCP
</I>&gt;<i> stacks can be quite dumb. 
</I>
Ok, I think I understand but I think other problems exist that are 
preventing it for working properly.

&gt;<i> When you get past that: I've had some trouble when web folders
</I>&gt;<i> are not on the same drive as Xitami. It &quot;should&quot; work, and often
</I>&gt;<i> it does, but sometimes it does not. 
</I>
I moved the webpage files as I stated above.

&gt;<i> Also: after setting or changing a Vhost, stop and restart Xitami. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure if it &quot;should&quot; pick up the change on the fly, but my habit is
</I>&gt;<i> to force it to start anew.
</I>
I do that too.

Jules
