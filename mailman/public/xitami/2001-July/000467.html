Hi Paul,
thank you very much for some good information for me as a &quot;novice&quot; to
these things ... I'm getting a better picture here.

&gt;<i>There are BIG security risks in running mail services. The biggest is
</I>&gt;<i>the post office: traditionally such programs accept mail from strangers
</I>&gt;<i>and deliver it anywhere. Spammers love these, because &quot;you&quot; get the
</I>&gt;<i>blame for their spam. I would be real wary of some post office from
</I>&gt;<i>unknown authors, with mystery options and unknown bugs. Also, older
</I>&gt;<i>emailers may not block newly discovered hacker tricks. Craig's program
</I>&gt;<i>looks excellent, but read the docs well and be sure to talk to him or
</I>&gt;<i>experienced postmasters to be sure your postoffice is secure.
</I>
I am trying to find a program I can run on my win2k machine without
being connected to the internet and for testing of certain e-mail
functions in my websites which I am testing ...  so there are no
security issues involved, in that I am solely in a &quot;sandbox by myself&quot;
here ... 

&gt;<i>If you just want script-driven mail sending, you may not need your own
</I>&gt;<i>post office. Your ISP surely runs a postofffice and should accept email
</I>&gt;<i>from machines on internal IP numbers (or with authentication). Configure
</I>&gt;<i>sendmail to submit mail through your ISP's post office. I found one for
</I>&gt;<i>Windows that can do this, but it is exceptionally hard to set up, and
</I>&gt;<i>the usual perl script must be hacked to feed it right. I'll probably
</I>&gt;<i>move to a full mail suite the next time this one frustrates me. 
</I>
Since I am paying by the minute which I am online, I do not have the
luxury of flat rates as in the US and other places perhaps .... thus I
was looking to be able to test websites and their e-mail functions (via
CGI or PHP scripts) while offline right on my Win2k PC /notebook ... Up
til now, I went the above route and uploaded the scripts to one of my
websites at my ISP's server, then tried and tested it with the ISP's
mail server etc ... had to &quot;uninstall&quot; the files again etc ....
headaches .. which I would like to work around with a simple
&quot;mailserver&quot; on my own machine

God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang
