<PRE>Hi people

i have had a very annoying problem that i finally figured out last week and
thought i might share with you all.

i found a neat php4 installer that included xitami in its list of servers
and having experienced the troubles that a lot of you mentioned here
installing php i decided to give it a shot.

when i chose xitami as the server it came back with a repy &quot;sorry cant find
xitami&quot;.

i thought bugger .. and went off to get the lastest version assuming it was
installed into a different directory.

i was right and the installer worked fine, but after this i had problems
with some perl scripts that simply wouldnt work.

i chased the obvious paths etc and still nothing but noticed new scripts
added with the .pl extension worked fine.

last week i decided to sort it ..got the lastest version of xitami and perl
ran the installs and still a few scripts failed but as per before.
if i ran the old version of xitami i was using everything worked fine.

in the early days of hosting i had found that using no extension instead of
.pl or .cgi forced windows to rely on the #! perl line in the script so i
renamed realland.pl to realland , but also had a realland.exe in the cgi
bin.
now using /cgi-bin/realland my script worked but i didnt seem to be able to
change (edit)anything.

finally it hit me the realland script wasnt being accessed at all.
for some reason either xitami or win2k was giving  realland.exe the priority
and using that instead of realland and realland.pl gave a 500 error.

i renamed my realland.exe to reallandtest.exe and realland.pl started
working instantly as well as changes made in either realland or realland.pl
being visable.

my exe files are made with perl2xe if anyone wants to try and replicate this
problem
