<PRE>Thanx paul ...perhaps i didnt make it clear that realland realland.pl and
realland.exe were all present and i was using the full path for these.

realland appeared to be working but it was in fact realland.exe that was
doing the job.

only when the exe was renamed did realland and realland.pl respond
correctly.

both realland.pl and realland.exe were copied from the cgi-bin in the old
version (the xiwin dir) to the new (xitami/cgi-bin/) dir and worked
seperately in the old dir if i started the old version of xitami.
it appears to me that the new versions are giving the .exe file preference
even when the exact path to the .pl file is used while the old versions did
not.
