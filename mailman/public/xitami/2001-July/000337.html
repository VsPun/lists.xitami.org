<PRE>OK, I have another question for everyone...

I've been running Xitami for several months now, and it's been working
great. My needs have changed, and for one site, I'll be setting up a
shopping cart that needs to be secured for credit card payments. What
would be the best way to set this up.

Do I just run the Pro version, and have it handle everything,
including Virtual Hosting? Or, do I run them both, and have the Pro
version just handle the secure CC entry pages?

Currently I have them both running, and I have the baseport on the pro
set at 10, so there isn't any confliction with the other server, since
I'm currently not using the pro version for port 80 hosting anyways.

This is all still pretty new to me, so any ideas/help/criticism would
be appreciated. 

Thank you,
jeff
