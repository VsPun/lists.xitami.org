<PRE>     I use a device like the Linksys router.  Mine is the CNIG904B from
CNET.  It is connected to my cable modem then their are four computers
plugged into the CNIG904B.  There's no Internet sharing software required.
The router takes care of everything.  For setup just plug a computer into
the CNIG904B and with your browser go to: <A HREF="http://192.168.1.1,">http://192.168.1.1,</A>  Fill out the
form you'll get for that particular machine.  One of the questions on the
form is asking if you want this particular computer to get it's IP address
automatically or do you want it to be assigned?  I have three of my
computers set to get it automatically and one set to it it assigned.  The
one that has it assigned is my Xitami server machine and I believe for a
server an assigned IP address is required.  The IP address I assigned it has
to be one of 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.4, I believe.  When traffic flows
between any of the four computers and the cable modem the router knows what
machine it came from and is going to.
