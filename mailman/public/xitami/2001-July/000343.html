As Ewan has said, there are third-party add-ons which will work with
Xitami (amongst other http daemons) to provide ASP.

One that I have tried is iASP == instant ASP from HalcyonSoft.  If you go
to <A HREF="http://www.halcyonsoft.com/">http://www.halcyonsoft.com/</A> and navigate your way around the menus,
you will find that there is a &quot;developer's edition&quot; which is a free
download (after answering some questions).  This is a slightly limited
version of the full commercial product, in that one is limited to only
ten sessions (the web site says two, but Halcyon have assured me that
it's ten).

I had been intending to use this, along with Xitami, to provide a
platform for an annual &quot;DIY e-Commerce&quot; course that we run at the end of
our undergraduates' first year.  Unfortunately, I discovered a gaping
hole in Halcyon's implementation of VBScript; one cannot instantiate the
RegExp class.  Since some of the lecturer's code depends upon using this
(and other classes), iASP was not &quot;fit for purpose&quot;, so sadly this year
we did as in previous years and used M$'s IIS 4.0 --- a shame, because we
wanted to encourage the thought-process that Microsoft is not the only
way of doing things.

Halcyon assured me that this &quot;bug&quot; would be fixed in v2.0 of iASP, but
with a fixed timescale we did not have the luxury of waiting for this to
be released.

Incidentally, iASP works on other platforms apart from Windoze, so with
Xitami provides an ASP capability of Linux, for example.
