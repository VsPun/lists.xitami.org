The Host: header is compulsory in HTTP/1.1, which has been out for about
2 years IIRC.  It was widely supported before that, and pretty much
everything that has been produced in the last 5-6 years has used the
Host: header.  Basically I don't see any problem using Host:-based
virtual hosting any longer; there are very very few people using the
older HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0-without-Host: browsers now, and a lot of
sites that won't work for them if they continue to do so.

If you're really bothered, put all the virtual hosts in subdirectories
and make the base configuration point at each subdirectory so that users
can choose which one that they want.
