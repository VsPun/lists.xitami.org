Umm - if  you are creating more than 25 line mail messages I think 
you'll have a stalled program waiting for someone to press enter if you 
do something like you propose.

Not quite sure what the solution is unless you have perl. If you have 
perl then a bat file that invokes perl and then does a file append would 
work for sure.
