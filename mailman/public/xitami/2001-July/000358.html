<PRE>In message &lt;006801c0ffb2$87884450$<A HREF="mailto:659305c3@futeltra">659305c3@futeltra</A>&gt;, &quot;Michael S. Kazarin&quot; write
s:
&gt;<i>I downloaded xitami2.5b4 for beos from bebits and installed it.  [...]
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway I encountered some problems. I belive all files included in the
</I>&gt;<i>package are the same as for windows distributions which I use except the
</I>&gt;<i>binary itself. Thus I guess it wasn't properly compiled, something wrong
</I>&gt;<i>with paths. 
</I>
&gt;<i>From the symptoms that you describe, it does sound like that is the
</I>case.  We don't actually produce the BeOS version ourselves, and IIRC
the binary that is on the website is (a) an older version, and (b) was
built by someone else.  As I understand it Xitami compiles with minor
changes under BeOS now, so if someone is interested in recompiling it,
please feel free.

For example the images located in ./webpages/images do not load
&gt;<i>if I type <A HREF="http://localhost/images/image_1.gif,">http://localhost/images/image_1.gif,</A> but they do if I type
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://localhost//images/image_1.gif.">http://localhost//images/image_1.gif.</A> On the other hand
</I>&gt;<i>./webpages/xitami/images works fine and
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://localhost/xitami/images/image_1.gif">http://localhost/xitami/images/image_1.gif</A> displays as desired. 
</I>
This is rather puzzling.  It's almost as if the path definitions are
wrong.  You might want to turn on server debugging mode ([Server] debug=1)
and see what path locations it is trying with each request.  And you
might also want to compare the configuration file in the Windows version
(or source package) with the ones in the BeOS one, just in case they are
wrong for some reason.

&gt;<i>Another serious issue for me is that when Xitami is started, cpu load for my
</I>&gt;<i>amd duron 750 goes up to 100% and stays there until I stop the server. I
</I>&gt;<i>have no idea what's going wrong. 
</I>
It sounds like it's getting stuck in a loop for some reason.  Normally
Xitami should &quot;go to sleep&quot; waiting for the OS to tell it that someone
has sent it a request to deal with.  For some reason this doesn't seem
to be happening for you.

Has anyone else found this with the BeOS version?  (I don't have access
to a BeOS version to test.)

If there's anyone who's built Xitami from source under BeOS, they could
perhaps turn on the tracing functions and try to figure out where it is
looping.
