Not sure what the problem here is - perhaps you could explain in more
detail as to what steps you have taken so far.

&gt;<i>I did try to install XiFusion, but i can't get it right because the readme

&gt;<i>this .zip i downloaded, tells me about an installationprocess
</I>non-existing. Also 
&gt;<i>some files that should be in the xifusion\bin aren't there.....
</I>
I think you mean ColdFusion ('cfusion\bin') when you say 'xifusion\bin'.
Remember that XiFusion is designed primarily for ColdFusion, but will also
work with PHP.  ColdFusion installs in the 'c:\cfusion' directory by
default.  XiFusion doesn't care where it is as it is a self-contained
executable (you could put it in c:\program files\myfavoritegames and it
won't care as long as it is someplace on your hard drive).

I interleaved PHP notes in with the ColdFusion installation information
since PHP is officially supported, but it isn't the primary/original use of
XiFusion.  You just need to pay some attention to the ColdFusion notes as
they will help to set up PHP, but don't follow every word since the PHP
notes are there to help set up PHP correctly.

Provide more details as to what you have so far (Filters section and the
location of XiFusion as well as the location of PHP) and I'll see what went
wrong and fix it.
