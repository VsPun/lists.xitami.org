This sounds very strange.  It sounds like Windows is causing problems
with Xitami trying to run programs.  We've seen this occassionally if
you have a virus scanner running, or some other security product that
tries to restrict what programs can do (Xitami needs to be able to run
other programs, to do CGI/filters).  

If you do have a virus scanner running or some other security product,
try disabling it briefly and see if the problem with Xitami and
CGI/filters goes away.  If it does, it's a conflict between the two
things.

If you don't have either a virus scanner or security product running, it
sounds a bit like something has got messed up with your Windows install
-- although that's a little suspicious given that it sounds like a
relatively recent install.  But sometimes Windows is just like that :-(
