It might have something to do with the fact that I've got a bazillion
pipe*.* files in my c:\temp directory...but I really don't know how it
would come about unless Xitami isn't cleaning up after itself or the other
version is assuming that there is only one copy running and the pipe files
are &quot;okay&quot; to write to.

I've done enough socket programming that I have to agree that Xitami
shouldn't have started if they were both trying to get port 80 (it is still
possible to do it, but fairly difficult to achieve).  Since it is extremely
unlikely that this is the case, my guess is that it has something to do
with the pipe files.

BTW, I'm now just using one version of Xitami, so it works fine.  Besides,
this is probably an ancient issue considering the two versions I was trying
to mix :)
