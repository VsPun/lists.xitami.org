<PRE>Hello all,
I'm currently running xitami and php on a win2k machine to test some
websites I am developing and everything so far has worked fine and
without problem.

Now I needed to do something which requires a CGI (a perl script)
solution and I am wondering what to do here ... I can call up the
testcgi.exe file provided with Xitami via the URL localhost at
127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe which puts out various system information
correctly and as such CGI seems to work.  But, I cannot call the
testcgi.pl file ... then I get an error message.

Question: Do I need something else first here to run CGI scripts which
are in perl? Where could I get what I need and where do I install it on
this win2k machine? I am not all that &quot;techno expert&quot; here ... (as you
probably guessed because I am even asking the question), but sure would
like to have my xitami installation run cgi scripts on those websites I
am working on which I have set up as virtual hosts ... 

Any help is very much appreciated. Thanks!

God bless you with His grace and peace 
Wolfgang Schneider
