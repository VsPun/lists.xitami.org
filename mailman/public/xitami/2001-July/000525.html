Are you typing '//localhost' into the browser?  If so, then you should note
that it might be looking for a machine called 'localhost' using the NetBIOS
protocol (hence the really long delays).  Try the fully qualified
'<A HREF="http://localhost/'">http://localhost/'</A> URL instead.  Also try '<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/'">http://127.0.0.1/'</A> as well.

Also, I don't see how you get out onto other servers if you don't have a
gateway defined.  I'll bet a gateway shows up if you run 'winipcfg' and
select your network card.  I would even bet you have DNS as well.  DHCP is
just a protocol to set up gateway, IP address, DNS server list, WINS, etc.
information.  DHCP just makes all of that transparent to you, but it can
come in quite handy at times to know that information.
