<PRE>I have set up something like you are asking about.

In the defaults.cfg file, under [Virtual-hosts] I added:
other.mydomain.com = &quot;other.cfg&quot;

In the other.cfg file, under [Server] I added:
Cgi-bin = &quot;c:/Other/cgi-bin&quot;
Webpages = &quot;c:/Other&quot;

You will have to add a zone for other.mydomain.com.

I already do this. I run 20 domains out of one box on one IP.

I have different domain names specified in the Vhost section done.
That works fine as long as the domain name is different.

when I add a CNAME named OTHER to the OTHER.MYDOMAIN.COM

then OTHER.MYDOMAIN.COM and MYDOMAIN.COM still go to the same site.
They shouldn't.

I already have a other.cfg, other.aut, default.cfg is made aware of them
and it still does not work but it works if I use
www.mynextdomain.com then it's found properly for any other domain with 
it's own host files in DNS and so on.

Of course I should not have to specify a zone file in DNS to get xitami to 
route the traffic to the correct location path.

Hence I need to get the other.mydomain.com to get a site of its own just 
like www.mynextdomain.com right next to www.mydomain.com

All you said to do I already tried and it doesn't want to get in there.
I don't really want to start specifying port numbers to clients.
They become easily confused as it is.
