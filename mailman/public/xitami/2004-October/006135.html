<PRE>Hi Peter,

and hi to all here that are using Xitami. It seems that even we are not so
much, we all really like so much. So much that even if not with full
support, even if long time between updates (not so needed... i think xitami
hasn't many problems :-)), even with someone (not including you) trying to
tell us &quot;xitami is dead, go away and use apache&quot; (or other webservers...),
there are many of us still here, still wanting this server works for us,
someone for it's simple use, some for little resource needed, someone for
multiplatform support, someone for any other thing (personally i really like
LRWP, that's why I'm here).

I really understand what you answered to all of us, and we can't force you
to nothing, xitami is a creature of yours, but i think the idea to put it on
sourceforge and let all the people like me and others that seems to be still
around to help live this project can be very good, and it seems that a long
time ago you thought the same way... Our interest is not to compete with
Apache or with any other thing, is only to let us use Xitami at best, couse
we like it. Stop. You don't have time to do that, but some of us may use
some free time to help this to go on.

I hope you don't see this like some interference in your work, I was sorry
even when last month I proposed a fix to a problem I had with slow
connection and after some time I put out some recompiled EXEs to see if that
problem was fixed. I just want xitami is secure and working fine.... (and
perfect?), nothing else.

Dario B.
