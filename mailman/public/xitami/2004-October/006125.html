As are some of your long time followers. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Xitami is, obviously, a project that is fairly static.  We make patches now

Those of us that use and know Xitami on a daily basis don't expect it to 
be an Apache. We appreciate it for what it is. A lean, mean, web-serving 
machine.

</I>
I paid my change for Xitami. Its capable of doing a lot, should one have 
the desire to put some of their own effort into it.

I also can sympathize with your team as a developer myself.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been asked by members of our team to &quot;officially declare Xitami dead&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> several times.  I've resisted.  We use the software ourselves.  We use it on

Please keep resisting.

&gt;<i> protocol handlers, a fully portable server.  Today Apache 2 is a fast, 
</I>&gt;<i> portable server and seriously: you should be using Apache 2 instead of Xitami 
</I>&gt;<i> unless there are specific things Xitami does better for you.
</I>
This I take issue with.

Apache does not run &quot;out of the box&quot;. Xitami does.

Apache is a horrid mess (no offense Apache folks) of configuration 
options, files, etc. Xitami has a clean and (most importantly) easy 
configuration that most can figure out just by looking at it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But... Xitami as a living product... it's clearly something who's time has 
</I>&gt;<i> come and gone.  The need for a small, fast, portable web server was painfully 
</I>&gt;<i> obvious in 1997-2000, and we are proud to have achieved what we did.  But 
</I>&gt;<i> today it's a niche product.
</I>
It is a living product, whether the powers that be want it to be or not. :-D

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We will continue to provide updates of Xitami, we will continue to publish the 
</I>&gt;<i> source code.  Other people may spend the time building binaries and nice 
</I>&gt;<i> installers - this is no longer our job.
</I>
We have the parts to fix it if need be.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this is a satisfactory answer.

</I>&gt;<i> On behalf of the Xitami team, which has included myself, Ewen McNeill,

</I>
Good luck in your future endeavors. Just keep us posted. ;-)

I have used Xitami for going on 5 years now and have NO intention of 
switching to apache or any other web-server. I have invested too much 
time and effort in writing the scripts and support mechanisms to do what 
I need to do on a daily basis with Xitami to go elsewhere..
