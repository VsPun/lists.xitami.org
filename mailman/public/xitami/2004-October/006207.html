OK then.  What is needed is a way to process a document that's written in
ASP (with all its little embedded bits of &lt;% %&gt;) and massage that into a
&quot;plain&quot; HTML document.

Hmm, sounds like one would need the following:
    Route the .asp file to a filter, running as a CGI program
    Let the filter parse the ASP, performing appropriate substitutions
        for the ASP bits; this in turn would require one to
    Install VBS locally on the server, so that it can act upon the chunks
        of VBS thrown at it by the CGI parser.
    
Ought not to be too difficult (but would probably run like a dog).

There was another company apart from Chillisoft that had an ASP plug-in
for Xitami; I tried it out about four years ago because I thought that it
might be useful for a class that we teach.  However, at that time, the
VB that it handled wasn't up-to-speed on things like the Session Object,
and we were forced to continue using IIS for that class.

   &quot;I don't use Linux. I prefer to use an OS supported by a large multi-
   national vendor, with a good office suite, excellent network/internet
   software and decent hardware support.&quot;
