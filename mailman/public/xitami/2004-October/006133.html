Thanks for the time you'all spent on your comments to this Subject.

I was the one that started this subject and the QUESTION has been answered with overwhelming
positive responses.

I was a developer for a long time (op sys, assemblers, various applications, protocols, compilers, etc.),,,,,but that was about 20 years ago. I took another direction rather than writing code!!!! :) :) Still do not write code, and allow the current professionals do their tricks!!!!! I have often thought it would be nice to get back into it and even thought about the open source of Xitami. But, that was just a fleeting moment (1 nsec). I have taken a look at some of that source code structure and to say the least it is an excellant design. Easy to follow, commented, and documented internally more than expected, etc.

I understand Peter's comments and the ever changing roles in a software development task as time goes on.

I also see that there is no desire at this time to end the Xitami Project or Support by iMatix. However, based on the current point in time of Xitami development other issues must be given priority----mainly feeding the family :) :)

I would like to offer the highest complements for the effort that Peter Hintjens, Ewen McNeill, Jonathan Schultz, Julie Pesesse, and the numerous other people that have put their time into the deveopment of Xitami. As well as the decision to offer it as open source as wello as the Xitami/PRO. These platforms have had terrific direction and a GREAT staff to manage these products!!!!

Along with the members of this GREAT Email Forum Support Group, the comments offered in this Subject, plus comments by Peter I am confident that Xitami support will continue at some level and be a product just as mentioned in the replies of this Subject---- A GREAT PRODUCT with GREAT Support. And, with this Email support group, plus those members that have selected the management of the open source, there seems to be a never ending level of support no matter what direction iMatix is forced to proceed.

Xitami at this site as well as Pro and the ease of use and support will continue to be used as well as recommended for other sites as required. 

The original question has been answered: Simply----&quot;It aint so, etc. !&quot;       :) :)

THANKS to all for the replies.

Jerry
