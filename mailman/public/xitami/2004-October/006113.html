<PRE>I am somewhat new to using Xitami and I really need ot activate ASP to work in my web pages.

I know, many will say, You're not running IIS, then why and so on.
Just trust me, I have 100,000 line sof code ready made and I want to use what I have, not re-invent the wheel again. Just get my site up and running.

SO, to make it simple...

I added the mime type in the default.cfg file to specify asp=text/html

Still nothing. THe page comes up but the code doesn't execute.

So, how do I enable this thing to run on my machine.

I have two systems running.

a) Windows 2000 Pro with IIS 5 and ASP support and the port is changed to allow Xitami to run on 80

b) Windows 2003 Server Std with IIS6 and IIS installed and allowed.

In other words ASP should run fine.

What am I missing?
