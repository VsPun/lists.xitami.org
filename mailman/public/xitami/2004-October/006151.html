Well, to be perfectly honest, there are zero web servers out there that are
&quot;user-friendly.&quot;  By user-friendly, I mean that I can sit the average
computer user down in front of a computer and tell them to run ProtoNova,
or Xitami, or IIS, or Apache, or iWeb, etc.  If it were between Xitami,
ProtoNova, IIS, and Apache, ProtoNova has the best _chance_ of working for
the user the first time.  The fact you use BeOS suggests to me you are a
power user and fall into the &quot;tinkerer&quot; category.  Over the past 3-4 years,
I have learned again what it truly means to be a user of a computer.  I am
a programmer by nature, but studying user habits has been a trait of mine.
Tinkerer/power user/etc. and user-friendly have two totally different
meanings to me.

The only problem is, you can't sell/market &quot;user-friendly&quot; to users.
They've been sold that by Microsoft already...and got burned.  Users are
therefore very skeptical about the phrase &quot;user-friendly&quot;.  Those who are
just joining this list or are new to the whole web arena might be scared
off by this.  And for good reason - no one, not even the almighty iMatix or
the supreme Shining Light Productions or even the amazing Microsoft has
mastered the concept of user-friendly when it comes to web servers.  Now,
some are more usable than others, for sure, but not one single web server
in existence is truly usable.

That said, if I were to take the four top usable servers and factoring in
market conditions, they would be, in order of preference:

1)  IIS.
2)  ProtoNova.
3)  Xitami.
4)  Nothing else.  Not even Apache.  I've reviewed every server in
existence and know nothing comes anywhere close.  (I did say iWeb back
there...the author contacted me about it once after I rated it the worst
web server in existence performance-wise and she admitted it was true but I
didn't need to be so blunt).

#2 and #3 could be argued over - both are basically the same thing in
regards to usability, but it is a moot point since IIS won this contest.
&quot;But,&quot; you'll just say that, &quot;you just said ProtoNova has the best chance
of being usable with the average user.&quot;  That's true, but the average user
isn't going to be looking for a web server because _none_ of the above are
usable.  I said the 4 _top_ usable servers, not the 4 _most_ usable
servers.  There's a big difference between the two.
