You surely don't seriously believe what you've just written?  IME, the
programming skills of those writing ASP is absolutely *dire* (which,
frankly, is exactly what I would have expected).  They are most certainly
NOT &quot;high level web designers&quot;.  Script kiddies would be closer to the
mark.  To my mind, code written in ASP is reminiscent of Dr Johnson's
dog:

    A woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on its hinder legs.  It
    is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.

At least programming in a real language, rather than a cut-down and
bastardized &quot;Visual Basic&quot;, does result in people using their brains.

As I said earlier, ASP offers *nothing* that cannot be achieved in other
freely-available languages.

   &quot;I don't use Linux. I prefer to use an OS supported by a large multi-
   national vendor, with a good office suite, excellent network/internet
   software and decent hardware support.&quot;
