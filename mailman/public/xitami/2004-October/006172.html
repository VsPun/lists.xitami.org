I am back running Xitami as Admin which is bad I know.

Even so, when I have defined a CGI bin folder on my VHOST site, it should 
be able to execute the file, right?
I keep getting one constant error and I can't find why it is giving me this.

&quot;Bad request: probably tried to POST a non-executable URL.&quot;

The very same CGI works just fine as long I run it on the main/default 
domain on the same server.

The config file for this domain specifies...
and yes its linked correctly because the site works

For security purposes removed the real domain name below and simply specify 
THEDOMAINCOM in its place.

[Server]
     Cache-defaults = &quot;0&quot;
     Cgi-bin = &quot;D:\\WWWUSR\\THEDOMAINCOM\\cgi&quot;
     Hostname = &quot;www.THEDOMAIN.com&quot;
     Webpages = &quot;D:\\WWWUSR\\THEDOMAINCOM\\html&quot;

It is not because the propagation of the domain is not done yet and the 
server is looking for www.THEDOMAIN.com as default dynamic re-director!
I tried that already on a completely different and properly configured 
domain and no CGI bin in VHosts appear to work.

Nope... so I finally found it.

In the default.cfg it specifies use /CGI-BIN/ before all CGI's.

In other words, if you specify the exact path instead of the CGI-BIN path 
name, you will try to execute a non executable path according to Xitami.
However, it still does work but only on the default domain. This glitch or 
hick-up only affects Virtually Hosted domains which do NOT allow 
/cgi/PathTo.Exe

In other word's a little twitched to get used to, however now at least 
no-one can just by displaying your source code find your CGI bin.
The have to execute it first so if your CGI directory was named 
/InMommysAttic/ you would still call it by specifying /CGI-BIN/.

     Just a hint if someone wonders.
     No need to respond to me about this.
