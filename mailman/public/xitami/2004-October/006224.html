Belarc Advisor can probably answer your hardware vs. software question.

I have been both a hardware &amp; software guy since the late 70's &amp; I learned with
a M$ OS it is best to look at software conflicts first &amp; then look for hardware
problems.

Xitami will try to serve up all page requests &amp; the only time it will cause a
problem is if it tries to serve more pages at a time than the OS can handle. 

If you are having crashes with just Xitami running make sure windows isn't
running something else in the background &amp; decrease the number of connections
Xitami will serve.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recently, i don't know why either, i've been receiving hits to my

</I>&gt;<i> Look in the log folder C:\Xitami\Logs  You will find ac------.log &amp; an

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The log file should show if there were any dos requests.
</I>&gt;<i> The error file should tell you what happened at that time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, the win98se crash could have been caused by to many users at one time

</I>&gt;<i> version of Xitami is 10 &amp; that may be to many for your system. 
</I>&gt;<i> Try resetting defaults.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> [Server]
</I>&gt;<i>     Limit = &quot;10&quot;  to 5 &amp; see if you still have problems
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i am wondering has anyone figured out a script that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reset xitami hits automatically, to counter the malicious hits coming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The number of hits doesn't make any difference. The problem is when there
</I>&gt;<i> are to
</I>&gt;<i> many people trying to get into your computer at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [p.s. - i have downloaded 2.5c2 from xitami.com but did not see the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install file. i'm so busy on other projects, i can't get it to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right now.]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just unzip it to a new folder in C:\Xitami252 &amp; copy the existing website
</I>&gt;<i> folder
</I>&gt;<i> the new folder. When you are sure you have everything working you can remove
