<PRE>I think a lot of people don't realize Xitami is Open Source. Why not put it
on sourceforge.net, and really get it open for more development. Actually I
see an entry for Xitami on SourceForge here
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/imatix-xitami/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/imatix-xitami/</A> but it doesn't seem to be all
that active.

I am pretty happy with the way my Xitami install is running on my Win2K pro.
It just chuggs right along, except I don't use the FTP portion. I have been
contemplating making the jump to Xitami Pro. My one complaint is that it
doesn't do ASP. I have it set up for PHP, Perl, and Cold Fusion but have
been asked for ASP.

I have dealt with IIS and Linux in the past, but I really like Xitami for
ease in maintainance and setting up new domains.

Ron

As are some of your long time followers. :-)

Those of us that use and know Xitami on a daily basis don't expect it to
be an Apache. We appreciate it for what it is. A lean, mean, web-serving
machine.

</I>
I paid my change for Xitami. Its capable of doing a lot, should one have
the desire to put some of their own effort into it.

I also can sympathize with your team as a developer myself.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been asked by members of our team to &quot;officially declare Xitami dead&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> several times.  I've resisted.  We use the software ourselves.  We use it

Please keep resisting.

&gt;<i> protocol handlers, a fully portable server.  Today Apache 2 is a fast,
</I>&gt;<i> portable server and seriously: you should be using Apache 2 instead of
</I>Xitami
&gt;<i> unless there are specific things Xitami does better for you.
</I>
This I take issue with.

Apache does not run &quot;out of the box&quot;. Xitami does.

Apache is a horrid mess (no offense Apache folks) of configuration
options, files, etc. Xitami has a clean and (most importantly) easy
configuration that most can figure out just by looking at it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But... Xitami as a living product... it's clearly something who's time has
</I>&gt;<i> come and gone.  The need for a small, fast, portable web server was
</I>painfully
&gt;<i> obvious in 1997-2000, and we are proud to have achieved what we did.  But
</I>&gt;<i> today it's a niche product.
</I>
It is a living product, whether the powers that be want it to be or not. :-D

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will continue to provide updates of Xitami, we will continue to publish
</I>the
&gt;<i> source code.  Other people may spend the time building binaries and nice
</I>&gt;<i> installers - this is no longer our job.
</I>
We have the parts to fix it if need be.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this is a satisfactory answer.

Good luck in your future endeavors. Just keep us posted. ;-)

I have used Xitami for going on 5 years now and have NO intention of
switching to apache or any other web-server. I have invested too much
time and effort in writing the scripts and support mechanisms to do what
I need to do on a daily basis with Xitami to go elsewhere..
