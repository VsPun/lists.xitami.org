Could be but I have tested this pretty well with every config I could on 
some processes easily running 100% CPU.
I have also tried with both hyper and single threaded CPU's and all levels 
from 128 - 4 Gb RAM.

&gt;<i>When Windows starts swapping out memory
</I>
If it does LOL
As far I know Windows Explorer.exe should not require 225 Mb Ram at any one 
time on a prescot chip.

&gt;<i>RAM isn't a problem.  CPU availability is the problem.  Hyperthreaded CPUs

</I>&gt;<i>true dual-procs will do slightly better than hyperthreaded.
</I>
The biggest problem I've had was 4GB RAM on a Prescot 2,8 GHz hyperthreaded.
I had to basically strip out 2 GB ram and stop using certain small tools 
that work fine on all my other machines.
I do run 7 different configs at the time being. All from CD-Based Knoppix 
to XP, 2K3 Server and 2k pro
Only Windows with Xitami yet though.

 &gt;I run Xitami on Win 2 K and serve about 800-1000 Mb per day at well over
&gt;<i> &gt;10-20 000 hits and it seems stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It seems to be, until people start serving up dynamic content or use the
</I>&gt;<i>built-in FTP server.  I personally never had a problem with static content.
</I>&gt;<i>  Of course, that doesn't say much.  I never had a problem with Apache with
</I>&gt;<i>static content either.
</I>
I run 50/50 static and dynamic content mainly through CGI's I make myself.
Also I constantly use both he FTP functions and remote controlled 
environments as needed without any problems so far in Xitami 2.5.
