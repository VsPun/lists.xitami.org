<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Thats a scary thought, Xitami being unofficially dead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've always perceived it to be one of the best solutions for small scaled=

</I>&gt;<i>n config files to manually add information too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;=20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess I have to follow the mainstream and run with IIS and Apache inste=

That's true. If there is a faster way to go in an view the list as it comes 
in, I'd like that.
Where is the link for it? :)

Much appreciate the service.

In fact, as I told Pieter today as well, I've been messing with the small 
side of Xitami since it first came out,
but basically to test some standard HTML designs when I first started 
learning that.

I have no plans whatsoever to change to the httpd mess, and I'm trying to get
the linux guys around me here to accept Xitami as well.


Later on I've done much more in ASP and VBS as well as CGI for VB
(Primarily VB5 since it's the first language that came out that was not 
directly possible to decompile.)

I still write my code in VB 5, keeping in mind, Dan Applemann's well placed 
words,
about not needing to buy the latest all the time to solve a simple business 
problem.

I have finally figured out the nicer parts of Xitami and it's virtual 
hosting features which are coming in handy as never before.

I have planned, in line with the desire to keep Xitami alive, to take up my 
CGI programming and minor workstation
coding again, with the intent to build a package that can actually handle 
DNS, SMTP/POP3 and FTP/HTTP
management both web based and WST based. Since I'll be doing  alot of this, 
why not build a good tool for it.

It will take some time and have to go on my spare time to-do schedule but 
I'll get something up there soon enough though.

Thanks all for reading this, and thanks in advance for any future help I 
may get from this forum.
