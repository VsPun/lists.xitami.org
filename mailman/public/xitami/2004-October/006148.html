Honestly, the worst part about Apache is that there is such a huge
following of people who don't know that there are better alternatives and
just continue spreading the word about it.  That said, Apache is actually
not too bad to use if you run Linux (already in the tinkerer group anyway -
that is, not your average computer user) _AND_ you don't want to do
anything fancy like virtual hosting or PHP.  Otherwise you have to quickly
get up to speed on the whole documentation end of things or just spend a
couple days hacking up the configuration files to something horrendous
(especially with VHosts).  I think that may be a major reason why users
won't leave Apache - they have too much time invested in it and don't want
to know that 30 seconds with Xitami or ProtoNova could have done the same
things they are currently doing.  It is more an issue of blind
leading/following the blind than anything else.  Of course, I understand
the feeling that if I invest a ton of time into something, I probably
wouldn't want to know about something that could have saved me weeks in a
matter of seconds either.  I would feel horrible about the issue for a long
time and then have to work up the guts to try Xitami or ProtoNova out.
There is a huge amount of inertia put in the way of an Apache user to
overcome.  Much more so than an IIS user.  IIS users are basically fed up
with Microsoft.  Every IIS web developer I've spoken with knows it is a
terrible server but can't switch.  How classic is that.  Books could be
written on the subject and movies made.

(Okay, maybe not movies - we have enough of the Lawrence of Arabia-style
movies to last 40 lifetimes).
