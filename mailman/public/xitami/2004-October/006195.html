I agree with you on the last line in this but... oh well... why don't we 
simply agree
that some flavors of various languages are not for everyone and some prefer 
to use
the write-only PERL and so forth.

I find it of little interest to hear that one language is useless, and if 
so, why are so
many using it, for whatever purpose it may be at which ever level it may be.

I would like to see more Cobol samples available too, and people laugh 
their heads off,
however when it came down to it, in 1999 Cobol programmers where paid 
masses to
fix the glitches written in Y2K resolutions.

Hence, one thing may seem obsolete to one, but be imperative to another.
Just please bare with us that we are NOT trying to force YOU personally to 
use ASP
any time soon, nor any time at all.

We are only looking for a way to provide the ABILITY for those who wish to 
do so and we
can very well do so without further negativity in this matter.

As I just have proven, however with a minor hick-up of port number 
specifications,
it clearly CAN and WILL be done by SOME and NOT by all.

Why in heavens name are you getting so upset?
Are you afraid to many people will find out how to do it and we'll get to many
newbie users in on the forum or what? Just let evolution and such have its 
way and
I'm sure most will eventually port over to a stronger scripting language.

Personally I noticed I could do without ASP by simply including 4 more 
lines in my CGI's.
That in it self does not imply that I will deny anyone else the right and 
ability to do whatever
they please to in their own environments.

Anyway, that's my two cents, and yes, I do write some pretty nice code 
sometimes, and not all the time.
If being a programmer or whatever implies a innate need to display hubris 
over the selected code environment,
then I will resign tomorrow morning. Why? Simple, it furthers nothing and 
brings nothing new to the table.

     To each their own, and so on...

Thanks for the word, and I will not say anything about ASP in Xitami
anymore as it appears to raise to many hot tempers.

     MRJ.
