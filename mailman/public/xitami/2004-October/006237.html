The only problem is, I don't know where else it is acceptable to discuss
ProtoNova with users who might be considering another web server other than
those lists that such users are subscribed to.  Put yourself in my shoes
and what would you be doing?

Of course I could be going about this all the wrong way and you know of a
better method that I am obviously missing that draws me some more business.
 It would be really helpful to give me some very specific places to go to
on the Internet where people _want_ to hear about such things.

At any rate, all mentions of ProtoNova will disappear off this list.  I
might stick around to help with Xitami-related issues, but will remove the
ProtoNova &quot;ads&quot; from even my signature if and when I do.  As it is, I have
effectively figured out how to alienate myself from you and other people on
this list and for that I'm sorry and regret what I've done.  I have learned
a few things through this experience.  I hope you'll find it in you
somewhere to forgive the damage I caused.
