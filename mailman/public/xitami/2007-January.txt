Subject: [Xitami] need help
Message-ID: <000c01c73022$5bd7f750$3cb45c45@Estees>

In 2004 a friend helped me set up Xitami V. 2.5c1. Originally it was on Windows 98SE.  I upgraded to Win 2000 Pro.  I had saved the Xitami file and just reloaded it after installing the new O.S.  

The person who helped me set up lives in another state.  I am a bit confused with the program, and he didn't explain much of what he did when he set it up for me. 
It was working fine, even after installing the new OS, but starting late Dec I have had crashes. I have read your info but as I said, its a bit confusing for me.  

The program is on a computer that runs only one thing.  I use it as my server program for my world in ActiveWorlds.  The computer is dedicated only to that use, none other.  In our house we are networked with 3 computers, which runs fine.  

Since it started crashing, the computer isn't being used other than run continuously for the world.  (Other people can access the world, but only to 'walk around in it and look around")  I restart the program and then the next or two its crashed again.  Below is what I copied from the log:

23/Oct/2006:07:24:08 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1
Abort at smttime:Generate-Response-Events:expire old requests (Expect-Event, Timer-Event)
29/Dec/2006:11:47:48 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1
Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self: (Getting-Event, No-Activity-Event)
30/Dec/2006:15:29:38 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1

03/Jan/2007:20:34:33 -0800 Xitami/2.5c1
Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self: (Getting-Event, No-Activity-Event)

The program is set to restart automatically.  

Can you please explain to me what is happening and what to do, very clearly and simply?  I have computer knowledge, but when it comes to programs like this, its difficult.  And I am nervous about messing with something I don't understand well.  

thanks

Esther

I have enjoyed flawless Xitami service for three years and suddenly, the program will not even start on my system.  It appeared that the latest Norton security download messed this up for me and I've since completely uninstalled Norton, but Xitami will not start.  I did a system restore and still nothing.

Thoughts?

Most likely some other application is taking the port that Xitami
wants to use. run

netstat -a -b

from a command prompt to see if that is the case.

As well, you may have a corrupt Xitami.cfg or Defaults.cfg file - which ever
you use.  I had a similar problem a few years ago - and no other application
was running that would have conflicted with Xitami or the Xitami ports.  On
a whim, rebuilt the cfg files and it all came up properly.  I now routinely
backup my cfg files.

Hello Jill

Norton mess quite a lot in your inner computer settings (System hooks ...)
In more extreme cases it's possible that your computer doesn't have internet
access anymore after unsuccessfully removing norton.

Norton has a remover on his site. (more than one version is available
depending on the norton av version you have).
You should try this first.
http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/tsgeninfo.nsf/0/048e51f0b379a27088256f5
f00621b93?OpenDocument
The aim is not to remove the application, but to get the system hooks right
again.

System restore will restore applications, but is quite useless in restoring
a system that's not functionning normally.

If everything fails, backup your configuration and do a format.

Did you simply drop the executable file in a folder after the new OS
upgrade, or did you run the Xitami Windows installation file and fully
install it again?

It's not exactly clear from your description, what the problem might be.
More detail is needed about what you did after the Win 2000 Pro upgrade,

ie what kind of a file, named what, inside a folder named what, and did
you get any pop-up messages from your system while you did all these,
etc.

(And please don't send Xitami List e-mails in html format but in plain
text format because it translates into pages and pages of source html
when text Xitami list receives it.)

I've been seeing similar unexplainable crashes recently - also on
win2k pro. I'm wondering if this is something to do with a win2k
security upgrade but am not certain.

" Most likely some other application is taking the port that Xitami wants to 
use"

All this talk got me to open my program which had xitami installed so as it 
could run on windows XP home.

It failed.

Like others I'm not ultra savvy at resolving these things

I get port in use by another application and it shuts down

So how do I swap the port it's looking for?

I think there could be a corellation between this problem and the MS service 
packs

I have solved my crash issues. It seems like it would crash when I couldn't
get back to the server for hours or days.  I didn't fix Xitami tho. I
installed AlwaysUp. Set it to run Xigui32.exe as an AlwaysUp service, when
Xitami crashes AlwaysUp restarts it for me. So far it's been working out
just fine.

There seems to be something that is causing it to crash.

We're in the process of relocating the imatix.com website from one
hosting machine to another.  It looks like the DNS update didn't catch
up with the move of the website :-(  (The new IP is 213.193.162.178.)

Hopefully it should all be working again tomorrow at the new site once
the DNS change propogates.  Apologies for any inconvenience.

Thanks for mentioning it.

Most likely some other application is taking the port that Xitami
wants to use. run

netstat -a -b

from a command prompt to see if that is the case.

Ok, before I even think about reinstalling the program, I need to know, if I
download an updated version (I cant seem to find the install file on the one
I have) will it also import my settings?  And just for my information what
is the install file name?   I have version 2.5c1.
thanks.

Thanks for the information Ewen, it's all working fine now for me. I
was concerned because of some hardware changes that Santa brought me.

Well Ester, that's an "it depends". It depends on where you made the
changes. If you followed the suggestions and created the "default"
files, i.e. defaults.cfg, defaults.aut and so on, then yes it will
just pick-up the changes. If you changed the files that came with
2.5c1 i.e. xitami.cfg, xitami.aut and so on, then you'd best back them
up and copy them to defaults.<whatever> after installing from
xiopen_2_5.zip. The current version is xitami 2.5c2 BTW.

Hi All (All the best for the New Year) and keep up the group.

I am wondering if anyone can help me, my server is running fine, i have
my primary domain register with an dns company this include a mail
server for the domain, i have registered other domain and have them on
my server and they all work fine except for mail, my mail server refuse
the connection and i don't know why or what to do about it. the actual
error is below:

	support@XXXXXXX.co.uk (554 <support@XXXXXXX.co.uk>: Relay access
denied)

Ps the above is not my primary domain name, but one hosted on my
server

The mail server working fine, but you are not authorised.
Mail servers are configured so that they only relay mail from authenticated
users.
There are different ways of authenticate:

pop before smtp is the most widely use: pop your mailbox and the mail server
will allow that IP to relay during a limited time frame. It doesn't work if
you have different servers for outgoing and incoming mail.

the smtp protocol allows identification, but the mail client that want to
send mail must connect directly to the server, not via the ISP relay (the
isp relay will not pass the authentification).

This is just a basic review, since this is not a mail server mailing list.

Most of that went over my head, things i do know:

"pop before smtp is the most widely use: pop your mailbox and the mail
server will allow that IP to relay during a limited time frame" 

I know the language your using is english, but i have no idea what your
saying, i thought pop (outgoing mail) and smtp (incomming) were set up
automatic when you cheate the mail server.


"the smtp protocol allows identification, but the mail client that want
to
send mail must connect directly to the server, not via the ISP relay
(the
isp relay will not pass the authentification)."

The domain name is on the server and can send mail to any address.
So i know i am not using my isp relay, its my server that is refusing
the connection.


thanks
Michael

pop is INCOMING (post office protocol), the mail is waiting to be popped
(downloaded) by the recipient

smtp is OUTGOING (simple mail transfer protocol), mail from your computer to
the internet

Thats normal behaviour for a mail server.
It will not relay if the user is not authenticated.
If you are sending mail to a local user (no auth. required) and the server
is refusing the mail, then the mailserver is not correctly configured
(doesn't know the domain is local)

I'm quite sure you are not understanding the intricacies of mail delivery.

On a server with IIS, this works fine.

On my PC running Xitami, it can't open the document:

This statement seems to go off and never return!
Is there someting I need to configure in Xitami to enable the XML

Personally, I had to reluctantly give up Xitami when I we started using
php. It just kept crashing. When I switched to IIS I did not have any
more problems.

Thanks for the reply, however this line is not in my .cfg file - in fact no
mention of xml. Incidentally my .cfg is nowhere near as long as yours - only
400 lines.

I am running v2.4 - could it be I need to upgrade?

We stopped development of Xitami some years ago and made only security
patches.  The reasons for this were simply that we had no more money
and time to spend on Xitami.

Well, Pieter are you looking for some developers? I know it is
"supposedly" Open Source but the missing "c" compiler command makes it
difficult for people to compile the source and make any improvements.
I happen to have found it on the Imatix web site through pure
literal-minded-ness but I could certainly use some documentation
and/or help in compiling it on my VMware Virtual 2000 Pro system, for
example where do I put the Xitami Source, under imatix or in it's own
directory?

The documentation for the imatix I compiled is present in
../imatix/docs but it hasn't yet told me the answer to this question.

I'd also like to know what your plans for Xitami were in terms of
systems development. After all I'm sitting here recovering from
surgery with little else to do than filter my E-mail for spam so a
useful project would be nice for me. I'm certain that there are others
out here who could further your goals for Xitami.

Xitami needs other iMatix tools, which are on imatix.com, but I agree
it's hard for people to contribute to the project.

If you want to help, why not start a Xitami development wiki, using
something like wikidot.com, which is a free wiki farm I use for a lot
of projects.  All your questions have answers, but it's probably
better to turn this discussion into usable help for others, than to
discuss by email.

Xitami was based on a server framework (SMT) which we have rewritten
several times since that time.  We're now using SMT/5 in other
projects, and one of these - a new messaging server called OpenAMQ -
will be released fairly soon.

In OpenAMQ there is also a new HTTP server, still very small, but I
see this as eventually becoming a new Xitami.  There is always space
for a small, fast, easy to configure web server.

Tragically that doesn't appear in xitami.cfg either. My xitami.cfg file is
the same size as defaults.cfg - about 400 lines.

how would i go about setting certain PHP config settings per virtal host?

; open_basedir, if set, limits all file operations to the defined directory
; and below. This directive makes most sense if used in a per-directory
; or per-virtualhost web server configuration file. This directive is
; *NOT* affected by whether Safe Mode is turned On or Off.
;open_basedir =

Subject: [Xitami] Running two copies of xitami
Message-ID: <45C02195.3020302@paradise.net.nz>

Hi everyone!

This is from my ISP...

"I have set the DNS records for 
dingbattees.co.nz to point to your cable 
IP of 203.97.121.175."


I am running
xitami and already have solarcharts.co.nz on
port 80 at the same IP. I have set up 
another copy of xitami for the dingbat 
tees website. Does this go on a 
different port? If so, where do I change 
the port number. I have tried the help 
pages but couldn't find how to do it.

Thanks
linda
