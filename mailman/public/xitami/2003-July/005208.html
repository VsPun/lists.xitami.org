<PRE>Hi there.
One of the purposes of a router and/or firewall is to hide your internal
PC's from the internet. So therefore any internal server is not seen from
outside. You need to tell your router to pass incoming and outgoing port 80
to your internal sever machine.
And, like you are currently doing, outside access must go to your public IP.
Internal IP's are not publicly routable.

Hi

I am new to Xitami new to servers in general. I installed Xitami on a
windows 98 os. Every thing works fine that I can tell. I can log on from the
pc that Xitami is installed on and from a second pc in the network. However
even if I am not behind a router I can not log on from another pc on the
internet. I have a static ip at that point(in front of the router) and use
that ip. The url I have been trying is     <A HREF="http://###.###.###.#">http://###.###.###.#</A>

My question:  is this correct format of the url needed to log on from the
internet? Or must I add some thing to the end. The server is monitoring the
standard port 80   Thanks to any one for any information they can offer.
Ron:
