<PRE>Thanks, Marcio. I originally _did_ look for archives for this list and didn't
see it referenced anywhere on Xitami.com. After you mentioned it existed, I
found it on lists.xitami.org. Then I was amazed at how these archives are
maintained. They aren't searchable and that I had to download a 16 meg file to
do a proper search for my question!

Anyway, doing a text-based search I found that were indeed &quot;many many answers&quot;,
most of them mentioning that PHP_SELF was a problem going back quite a ways, and
never apparently fixed. There were a number of workarounds mentioned. I'll look
at these, but I'm dealing with a set of third-party scripts that I'd rather not
mess with. I'll probably test them out with Apache which works properly.

&lt;RANT_ON&gt;

If anyone from Xitami monitors this list, please note: why isn't the
lists.xitami.org link referenced on the support page on the .com site? And why
isn't the fact that there _are_ archives mentioned on the &quot;Welcome&quot; email from
this list? Why is it necessary to archive full headers, which accounts for the
vast majority of the 16 meg archive size? And most unforgiveable of all: why
aren't the archives searchable??? Doing text searches and wading through headers
and quoted text and html messages - rather than being able to view messages by
threads - is enormously inefficient.

&lt;/RANT_OFF&gt;

MM&gt; |
MM&gt; |
MM&gt; | It appears that Xitami doesn't set PHP_SELF.
MM&gt; |
MM&gt; | Haven't needed it till now, but now a set of PHP scripts require
MM&gt; | $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']. I saw in the Xitami release notes that this was
MM&gt; | fixed way
MM&gt; | back in 2.4b release of 98/11/08.
MM&gt; |
MM&gt; | Is this a known bug or fixable via some configuration?
MM&gt; |
MM&gt; | If it is a bug, I will have to abandon Xitami.
