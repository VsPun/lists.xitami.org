Hmm; had you perchance edited the file to say &quot;c:\php\php.exe&quot;?  I
suspect that, like many other files, if you *really* want a backslash to
appear then you need to write it as &quot;\\&quot;.  (Since the sequence &quot;\p&quot; is
not a recognized character escape sequence, then the backslash was merely
ignored.)

There is NO NEED to include any backslashes in any filepath for Xitami,
even when running under an operating system that (ostensibly) uses
backslashes as path separators; this is because even Windows XP still
understands its oldest heritage and will happily understand forward
slashes as path separators (except on command lines, where the forward
slash is interpreted by the excuse for a shell as the introducer for an
option or switch).

So you ought to have had &quot;c:/php/php.exe&quot;.

So: who told you to edit the file to include backslashes?

NB This is all conjecture on my part, but not, I think, without
foundation.
