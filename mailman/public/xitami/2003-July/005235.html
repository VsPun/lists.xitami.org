</I>&gt;<i>I appreciate your criticism, very good information.  Is there a situation

</I>
PHP is optimal for small sites that have no future growth expectations.  My
old PHP-based website:

<A HREF="http://www.shininglightpro.com/">http://www.shininglightpro.com/</A>

Has long been overdue to switch off of PHP to another scripting language.
That site is a beast to maintain and has thousands of lines of
compatibility code that I should never have had to write, but what really
crossed the line was that the latest versions of PHP kept breaking site
functionality (I have to keep an old version of PHP around just for that
site as &quot;upgrading&quot; would require re-writing thousands of lines of code).
PHP is optimal when nothing else is available (this is from a
professional/technical/business as well as my own personal standpoint).
Performance-wise, PHP compares well against most other scripting languages
(the ONLY thing going for it, IMHO), but this issue is being addressed in
the next few versions of Nuclear Vision and will put NVML on basically the
same performance level as most scripting languages.

Hope this helps!
