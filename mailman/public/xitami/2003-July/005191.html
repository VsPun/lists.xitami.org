<PRE>  Hello everyone,

  I've got a problem (I think) and I'd sure like to hear from you guys as to 
what you think it is, and what to do about it!  I use one of the online 
hit-counter, &quot;Sitemeter&quot;, that lets you check how many hits you have as well 
as where they come from and how long they stay.  Everytime I check it I&quot;ve 
noticed that there is one particular ip address ALWAYS there!  At first I 
just thought that this person enjoyed my site, lol, and spent a lot of time 
there, but now I'm getting a bit worried about it!  What could this be?  Are 
they just linked to an image on my site, or are they spying or hacking me or 
what?  Also, how can I go about blocking that ip addy?  I have seen some of 
you talking about this in the past, and would really like to know what you 
think this is, as well as what to do about it!  Thanks to all of you in 
advance, and I hope you all are having a good day!  Happy upcoming 4th!
