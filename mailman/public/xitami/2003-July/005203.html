<PRE>Hello !

Another &quot;missing&quot; feature in Xitami is the lack of ISAPI. This protocol 
seems to be getting a standard for fast cgi.
In the normal version of cgi-bin, when a user clicks on a cgi-bin page 
(pointing to an executable), a complete new environment is created for this 
executable.
This can take some time.
When using ISAPI, when a user request a dynamic page, the server calls the 
adequate routine in a DLL. This is much faster: no environment to create, 
and presumably the DLL is already in memory. But since the DLL resides in 
the same memory space as the server, a simple error in your DLL will pull 
the server down. When using normal cgi, an error in your executable is 
detected by the server, and it return an error to the client.
ISAPI is quite a mixed blessing.

You can password-protect directories, but it seems impossible to protect 
execuables.

Overal, Xitami is a simple and easy to use webserver.
Sambar is more up-to-date, has more features, but is more difficult to 
implement.
