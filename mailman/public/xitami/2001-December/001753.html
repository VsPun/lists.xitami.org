<PRE>Back to basics. VERY important: Xitami 2.4 or 2.5 ? 

The SSI handler changed radically between 2.4 and 2.5. 

In 2.4 it was an external Perl script. You need Perl, installed
and working. You can read through the Perl script (it is quite
simple) and see where it may be going astray.  

2.5 is officially &quot;beta&quot; so I have not even peeked at it. (I
drive 20 year old cars so I'm not one to jump on every new
model.) From comments here, 2.5 itself seems as stable as 2.4,
but some frills aren't done yet. In 2.5 the SSI is handled in the
main Xitami code. Apparently nobody uses SSI because I have not
seen much about it here. Again the source code (except in C) is
available for study. 

&gt;<i> the resulting page shows [xitami SSI:]  (the error code format as defined in the SSI page on xitami's configuration page) but I don't know what the error is
</I>
What exactly do you see? If you actually see &quot;the error code
format&quot; rather than an error code, my blind-guess is that the C
routine can't find Perl. 

I'm confused by Ewen's comments and will post to him. 

Marc's idea to use a SCRIPT tag may be off the mark. That would
seem to run on the Browser, not the Server. For a &quot;Hello world&quot;,
that might be cool, except a Win32 EXE won't work on Mac or unix,
and Win-users may object to running your (possibly malicious)
code on their machine (I don't think any Win browser actually
will run an EXE as a SCRIPT). For a counter, it is no good
because the count has to be kept on your server, not on hundreds
of browsers. If you &quot;want to create a drop down list in a form
from items in a database&quot; on your server, obviously the EXE has
to run on your server (or have some magic way to run on the
client while accessing your server database, which is really
doing it the hard way).
