<PRE> &gt; I'm wondering if the key difference from the last set of problems is
 &gt; whether or not there is an actual device (modem, printer, whatever)
 &gt; installed on the particular port name in question (aux, lpt, etc).

Yes we already established that 2 weeks ago I thought.

 &gt; Also, can those who have crashes with &quot;<A HREF="http://localhost/lpt1"">http://localhost/lpt1&quot;</A> please try
 &gt; &quot;<A HREF="http://localhost/prn"">http://localhost/prn&quot;</A> (which ought to be the same device, according to
 &gt; DOS tradition), and see if it gives the same effect.

Just tried, it does.

 &gt; (a) the exact URL used during testing (including the exact upper/lower
 &gt;     case, etc)

I'm not keen to do this on an open list. So it's <A HREF="http://www2.xxx.com/lpt1">http://www2.xxx.com/lpt1</A>
(but not xxx) and <A HREF="http://www2.xxx.com/prn">http://www2.xxx.com/prn</A> but the case doesn't seem to
matter as <A HREF="http://www2.xxx.com/LPT1">http://www2.xxx.com/LPT1</A> will also bring it to its knees.

Just to clarify, it doesn't always happen first time, you have to refresh
the page a bit. Also it is NOT restricted to local connections. Remote
connections will bring it down just as easily.

 &gt; (b) the version of Xitami being used (2.4d9, 2.5b5, windows gui, windows
 &gt;     console, nt service)

v2.4d9 (W2K service)

 &gt; (c) the version of Windows you have

Xitami Server is W2K Pro SP2 - clients can be anything.

 &gt; (d) what web browser you used (name, and version)

I've tried IE4.0, IE5.0, IE5.5, IE6.0, Opera 5, Netscape 4.7 (in other words
it is probably not browser related)

 &gt; (e) any service packs, patches, etc that you have

SP2, Fully up to date from windows update site.

 &gt; (f) what devices you have installed (modem, printer, etc)

EPSON EPL-5200 laser on LPT1

 &gt; (g) what crashes (eg, just xitami so you can kill it off and keep going;
 &gt;     the OS freezes so you need to ctrl-alt-del and reboot; the OS
 &gt;     freezes so hard that you can only turn the machine off/hit reset)

Xitami, stops responding to requests and the service will not shutdown. You
can not force it to shut by using the services applet or by using
taskmanager but you can be using pskill.exe from sysinternals.com. The OS is
not effected.
