<PRE>PHP is just another programming language for CGI.

PHP code is written directly into the HTML code, parsed by the server and
then replaced by the output of the program.

One strength of PHP seems to be database interaction.

Same as Perl, PHP is a scripting language that is not compiled.

PHP is available for all major (and many minor) Servers and operating
systems.

As far as I know PHP has been developed especially for CGI tasks and has
many built in commands for these - unlike other programming languages such
as Perl, C, etc., where you need libraries, modules or individual hard
coding.

Why don't you download PHP, install it and see for yourself? There are very
good tutorials in the web. When downloading, you will find out if there is a
16-bit version too. The official website is <A HREF="http://www.php.net/.">http://www.php.net/.</A>

Good luck,

Hugo
