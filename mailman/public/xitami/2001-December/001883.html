<PRE>Ewen says:

 &gt; I was going to ask if you had problems with AUX.

Ok I've now done the definitive test. I created a new printer (generic text
only) and told the OS it was on COM1 (it didn't actually exist you
understand). I then entered www.xxx.com/com1 into Opera and lo and behold it
crashes. The same for AUX. So that is it I'd say. Your theory is correct.

 &gt; And as mentioned before, I suspect the issue is now restricted to
 &gt; situations where the device is actually present (eg, a printer
 &gt; installed).

Indeed. Although only the OS has to think it is present it doesn't actually
have to exist if you see what I mean?

 &gt; The other interesting factor from your detailed post is that it doesn't
 &gt; happen every time, only when you've hit refresh a lot.  That screams
 &gt; &quot;race condition&quot; to me

Well... yes but don't get too stuck on this as I can make it happen on the
very first go sometimes as well. I did with the COM1 test above.
