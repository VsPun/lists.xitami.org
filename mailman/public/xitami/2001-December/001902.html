<PRE>I just started Xitami and don't know a lot about it.  One of the things I
am interested in is using my private machine to let others ftp to me on
the net. I assume I can do this on win 98. I looked in the faq but didn't
see anything that was clear to me.

Basically, I want to know what URL I would give to others to be able to
ftp to my xitami folder. I seem to recall fuzzily that I need an IP
address for my machine, and that some ISPs don't supply a usable IP, but
I also forget how to find that. If you reply assume I am in a total state
of ignorance about this ;')

Yours,
