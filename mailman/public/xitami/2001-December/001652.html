<PRE>Hello,

I got Xitami 'cause I got tired of someone else running my server for me,
and telling me what I can and can't do.  I can, and have, spent all day
looking around the internet for pre-made CGI scritpts with idiot
step-by-step instructions on how to install it, and have the script do
almost what I want it to do.

But, I would really rather make my own scripts that do exactly what I want
them to do.  I don't even really know what I want them to do yet.  I am
inspired by discovered possibilty.

I am a programmer by trade, but I am still very new to any sort of internet
programming.  I mainly know old-school (GW BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL) and  a
half-dozen very proprietary languages.  Currently my Xitami FTP/HTTP server
is running on Windows ME.

I was wondering if anyone could help me with:

A) What would be a good first scripting method to begin with on Xitami?
(PHP,  Perl, etc.)

B) Where are the good beginner tutorial sites, PDFs available for this type
of scripting?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Jay Aldrich
