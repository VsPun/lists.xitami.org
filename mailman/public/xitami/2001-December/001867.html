And doesn't if no printer is installed?  (Can someone check this:
temporarily uninstall the printer in Windows, and try again to see if it
locks up.)

I'm wondering if the key difference from the last set of problems is
whether or not there is an actual device (modem, printer, whatever) 
installed on the particular port name in question (aux, lpt, etc).

The fix in Xitami 2.4d9/2.5b4 was to take each filename it was asked to
open, open it, and ask Windows &quot;is this a file?&quot; -- if Windows said
anything other than &quot;yes, it's a normal file&quot;, then Xitami closed it
again and backed away quickly (returning 403 etc).  

Possibly this test is either (a) getting an unexpected result when there
is a real device installed, or (b) something about doing the test that
way causes problems when there is a real device installed.

Also, can those who have crashes with &quot;<A HREF="http://localhost/lpt1"">http://localhost/lpt1&quot;</A> please try
&quot;<A HREF="http://localhost/prn"">http://localhost/prn&quot;</A> (which ought to be the same device, according to
DOS tradition), and see if it gives the same effect.

Please report:
(a) the exact URL used during testing (including the exact upper/lower 
    case, etc)
(b) the version of Xitami being used (2.4d9, 2.5b5, windows gui, windows
    console, nt service)
(c) the version of Windows you have
(d) what web browser you used (name, and version)
(e) any service packs, patches, etc that you have
(f) what devices you have installed (modem, printer, etc)
(g) what crashes (eg, just xitami so you can kill it off and keep going;
    the OS freezes so you need to ctrl-alt-del and reboot; the OS
    freezes so hard that you can only turn the machine off/hit reset)
