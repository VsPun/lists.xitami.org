   Hey Joe, yeah cool..


   That was my next question on the list of questions
I have for Xitami. This V Host stuff is ALL knew to me,
but I know it's all about seperate accounts, and domains
even. Configuring multiple accounts can be tricky I'm
sure, U got any pointers U would like to share? Anything
pop into your mind to be mindful of in the setup? Are there
some things U have to remember to set for ALL accounts
that U could list? Anybody else wanna contribute on this 
thought?

   Heck I know, basicly with DSL I can actually have
as many as 250 &quot;different&quot; connections, now whether or not
I'm prepared to service that many connections at once
is seriously questionable. But I know in theory that I could,
and that Xitami could take me a long ways towards reaching 
that number. I had 8 connections of continuous downloading all at 
once. It put a strain on the little 486, but Xitami was pumping it
as fast as the PCI bus could deliver it. The DSL was a constant
flicker of lights. It was kinda like &quot;christmas&quot; again for the very
first time.

&quot;Huston, we have contact&quot;.
