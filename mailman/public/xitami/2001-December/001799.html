   You are right, I know absolutely nothing about which
scripts do what. A few pointers in the right direction
would be helpful. I'm testing out Xitami at www.bd4u.com
I'm looking for replacements for what I'm currently getting
from CJB. I've already found CGI script replacements
for everything except Chat. I use mIRC alot, and would like
to tap into thier client base as well. Anybody with any
suggestions, specificly for Xitami?

  I like Xitami, it's short and sweet, and delivers quite alot.
The fact that it doesn't even use MS network software 
to run it is another plus. I'm running the server on a 
486 at 132 Mhz with PCI bus connected with 10/100 PCI
netcard  to 512k DSL. On a WIN95 platform with 48 Megs of ram. 
It runs smooth as silk. I'm very satisfied with it's performance so
far, and so are many of my associates. One of whom is
probably downloading a copy right now.

  So much for the intro, anybody know which IRC chat
works best with Xitami? There sure are alot to choose from..

Bruce
