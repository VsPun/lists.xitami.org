<PRE>&gt;<i> What is aux anyway? 
</I>
In CP/M (before MS-DOS), the devices were CON, PRN, PUN, and AUX. 

CON was (still is) the CONsole: display and keyboard, teletype or
CRT. 

PRN is a printer, and generally Serial (but not always RS-232!)

PUN is the paper-tape punch, to save data on. (I can't remember
if you read tape on the same port or if there was another, RDR?)

AUX was basically &quot;extra&quot;, like spare inputs on the back of a
hi-fi amplifier. Usually AUX pointed to the serial port driver. 

IBM had CP/M in mind when they made the IBM PC. The first O/S for
the PC was that thing Gates bought and modified, which IBM sold
as IBM PC-DOS. But IBM had mapped out multiple serial ports and
adopted a parallel interface for the Epson printer they were
re-badging. So the ports had to have more names to cover all the
new possibilities. LPT1 LPT2 LPT3 (and LPT4 on PS/2 BIOS) denote
the parallel ports. For back-compatability, by default PRN points
to the same routine as LPT1. 

A fully IBM compatible PC has a display much faster than any
serial port, and CON defaults there. However you can re-map CON
to a serial port and there is even a utility to do so. I once had
an Intel-made 286 that would run DOS but was -not- IBM PC
compatible: no internal video. On that beast, CON defaulted to
one of the serial ports and DOS and WordStar ran on a terminal. 

There are a LOT of reserved device names in this tradition.
MS-DOS 2+ has CLOCK (or CLOCK$$). And let us not forget NUL.
Win95/WinNT extend this by giving &quot;LPT1.DOS&quot; a special meaning:
much like &quot;LPT1&quot; but not quite.
