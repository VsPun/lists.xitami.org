<PRE>Hello !

It's not cheap, for a rather simple program, but if it's the right one, the 
money is well spend.
You don't need the DLL-version, only the console one, since you can 
#INCLUDE all the needed recurrent functions in your source (this will also 
speed execution, since there is no loading and linking of DLL's at run time).
If you have any programming experience in basic, writing complete programs 
in PB is easily done. It's a well structured language. It's that simple you 
don't need any tutorial. There is a windows help file included in the 
package for the case you're a newbee in basic.

Xitami will send your program the query string and even parse the form 
fields (if you use a &lt;form method=POST ...&gt; in your html source) by setting 
the environ. It's that simple i could't believe it at first!
And writing output to the browser is even more simple: you simply PRINT it 
to the provided temp-file!
I can mail you a small source code that sends the complete environment 
back, ideal for checking what Xitami actually sends to your program, 
depending on how you call the program.

There are all sorts of available basic routines for parsing data, but don't 
be fooled, you won't need them.
