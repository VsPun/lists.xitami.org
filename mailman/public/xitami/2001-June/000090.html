<PRE>At work (I teach in a university) we've just decided to set up a class
using Xitami (and InstantASP from Halcyon Soft) to replace an exercise
that used to be done under IIS.

So last week I collected the Windows version of Xitami 2.4d7, and
installed it yesterday (on one trial machine).

The first thought that occurred to me was that it ought to be possible to
run it as a service, rather than just auto-running it once someone has
logged in.  I looked through the FAQ - no mention.  I also saw this
mailing list described, and have been subscribed to it for 24 hours.

I *did* try moving the item that gets generated under the
...\CurrentVersion\Run registry key into ...\RunServices instead, and
indeed Xitami does then start up (although it shows an annoying &quot;about&quot;
screen wwhen so doing).

Then later, I saw that there IS a mention of running it as a Service
under Win9x, oddly enough on the downloads page (I didn't read any
further having once identified the package that I [thought] I wanted:-)

So today I fetched the console version, which has of course been updated
since my FTP session of last week, so I got bc3224d9.exe.  According to
the installation description &quot;The Xitami console version installation
package asks whether you want to install it as a Win95 service&quot;.  SFAICS,
it did NOT ask this question; neither did it create &quot;a small dispatcher,
called &quot;C:\Services.bat&quot; which simply changes to the Xitami directory and
then runs Xitami&quot;.

Has the installation procedure been botched since those words were
written?  Or has this part never been written after all?

Can I manually create the requisite batch file, and install the registry
key manually (I'm quite happy with registry hacking)?

As an extension, would it be possible to start the iASP admin and servlet
processes from within the same batch file as well?
