<PRE>&gt;<i>I have had a look at Paul Reid's site which works fine with multiple RA 
</I>&gt;<i>files and password. 
</I>
&gt;<i> One thing you might want to consider if it's causing you a lot of pain
</I>is &quot;security through obscurity&quot; -- put the RA files in a non-password
protected directory, and just only link to them from your hidden page.

I posted to Don off-list; I didn't want to tell everybody the details of my
&quot;security through obscurity&quot; trick.

But just as you say: the HTML file and a RAM file containing the URL(s) of the
media file(s) are in an Xitami-password directory; the actual media files are
in a &quot;public&quot; but not browsable folder (and a different machine and server,
but that should not matter). 

The security risk is that someone might capture the RAM file; or the URL in
standalone RealPlayer, and give it to unauthorized persons. 

&gt;<i> The difference is that my RA files are embedded which seems to cause the problem in IE. 
</I>
Don's page with embedded player is slick, I like it; but I had little luck
with embedding more than one player per page. It is supposed to work, I've
seen it work (without passwording), but it all seems very flaky to me. I think
it is a low priority at Real.Inc.
