Changing file type probably won't help; and if you change to the real
&quot;this is where to get the audio/video&quot; index files (.rpu? I forget),
then the problem wil probably get worse.

&gt;<i>The problem does not occur if the web page has only one RealAudio file or

The default for subdirectories is to use the settings of the parent that
is protected, and this seems to be what is happening in your case.
However I'm puzzled by your statement that it doesn't happen if there is
only one RealAudio file on the page; the factors I gave before would
leave it either working or not working with 1 or more files on the page.

What you might want to try doing is turning on the Xitami server
debugging ([Server] debug=1), and then try loading the page.  Once
you've done that look at debug/debug.log to see what queries Xitami
received, and how it handled them.  My guess is that for some reason one
of the queries must be missing the username/password -- but I'm puzzled
why including two real files on the page causes that when including just
one doesn't.
