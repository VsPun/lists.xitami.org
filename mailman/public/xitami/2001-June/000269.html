<PRE>Also what I had trouble with was the Hosts and Hosts.sam and LMHosts.sam
files under c:\windows under win98se had to put in the ip addresses of the 3
pc's on the network into each of them. (Norton antivirus has entered in some
settings into one of the 'Hosts' files on my pc).

Subject: [Xitami] why doesn't it work?


I just bought a server and I networked them together
with two ethernet cards in the server so the other
computer can use the internet. I used the same IP
address only when people try to connect they don't
seem able to because I think it is because that it
runs two different IP's. Do you have any idea how to help?
