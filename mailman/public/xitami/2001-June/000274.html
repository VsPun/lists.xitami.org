<PRE>&gt;<i> Netscape won't refresh images when they change if they are
</I>available in the cache.

No, though there is a trick. If the Height= or Width= has
changed, NetScape thinks it is a new image. As a web-wacker you
can change Height=200 to Height=201, and see the change. But you
better change it back.

The other way is to right-click on the stale image, &quot;Open in new
window&quot;, you'll get the stale image but shift-reload forces that
image to get fresh (without having to reload -all- the images on
the page). Then Back gets you the full page with the fresh image. 

Dennis &gt;  I set those options long ago! 

OK, I believe you. While I rarely have problems seeing my
changes, I too have had to force it sometimes.

Are there any proxy servers or caches along the way? AOL in
particular caches pages their customers have requested, in case
another AOL user asks for the same page soon after. Thomas's
meta-tags *may* force AOL's caches to read a new copy every time
(though I thought AOL needed no-cache in the HTTP header, not the
HTML file). Other ISPs also cache to reduce load; my school had
to cache for a few months while one of the two outside lines was
down for repair and traffic on the other line was clogged.
Caching a few hundred of the student's favorite external sites
really took the edge off the overload.
