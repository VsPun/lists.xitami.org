What is the &quot;them&quot; you are referring to?  If you bought a server, there is
only a single node on the network.  If you are attempting to interface the
server with a current lan to provide a single connection to get to the
internet, you need to set up gateway information on the machines on the lan
to point to the right place.

If you are running Xitami on the server and the server has two network
cards (what I suspect you are doing), the server's network cards need to
have their own individual IP addresses or the requests coming in will get
messed up.  To load-balance the requests, I suggest purchasing a
load-balancing switch rather than messing with a software-based solution
(really messy if you ask me).  That way, if you get another server later,
you can offload some of the load onto the newer server.

Also, the IP addresses of the network cards have to be real IP addresses on
the internet (or the firewall has to forward all connections on port 80 to
the firewall's IP to the web server).  If you want clients on the lan to
access the internet through the server (via a proxy), you have to assign
one network card with a LAN IP (10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x number, depending
on which you use) and the other with a valid internet address.  You can't
just assign the internet address whatever you feel like using unless you
have a static IP (in which case you have to use that IP and nothing else).

Without more information on what exactly you are trying to accomplish with
the server and how Xitami fits into this, this list can't really help you
very much.
