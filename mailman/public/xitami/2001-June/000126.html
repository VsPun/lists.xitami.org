FWIW, a colleague of mine tried installing Xitami on some machines in a
teaching lab last year (I don't know which version he was using).  The
machines all worked fine if one logged in to them as &quot;admin&quot;, or with
otherwise unrestricted accounts, yet if one logged in with a very
restricted account[1], the server would only respond to the loopback
address, and not to that of the LAN[2].

I'm pleased to say that bw3224b9 does *not* suffer with this problem: it
runs with both the 127.0.0.1 and the allocated 193.63.241.* addresses
quite happily whatever the privileges of the user account.

[1] I've used the System Policy Editor[3] to create very restrictive
accounts to prevent students screwing up the configurations of these
Win95 machines; it works *really* well.  (Of course, it makes it much
easier to prevent these policies being circumvented by having a PDC on
the network too.)

[2] The LAN has fixed, pre-allocated IP addresses: no DHCP involved here.

[3] There have been no changes to the policies between last year's
failures and this year's successes: originally, I had thought that some
part of a policy prevented a server process from binding to, and/or
listening on, any IP address other than 127.0.0.1.
