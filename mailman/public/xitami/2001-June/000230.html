<PRE>&quot;&quot;This is how I got Perl running in Xitami
it allows me to use,

&lt;!--#exec cgi=&quot;/cgi-bin/test.pl&quot; --&gt;

This SSI command
which is a potential security risk for your system
is only accepted if the environment variable
SSI_INSECURE is set to 'yes'&quot;&quot;

Ok so maybe I need to re-word this to make it clearer
I will work on that, Although I think this may be moot
as Xitami advances
