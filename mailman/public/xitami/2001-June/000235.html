Hi,

This was talked about by Andrew Tate a while back, but I didn't quite follow 
his directions.  I have a single web site running fine, but I have purchased 
a second (similar name) so that I could do testing.  I had it directed to my 
DSL provider, who just pointed it to my same IP address, so now I get my same 
web site when I type in website-name1 or website-name2.  

I would like to be able to have it go to the correct website when I type in 
the name, and I am pretty sure that I am supposed to use the VHOST stuff, but 
the documentation is fairly thin on how to actually set this up.  I think 
that Andrew Tate is running it that way now, so I gues what I would like to 
have is him, or someone else who is already doing this to point out what they 
did VHOST-wise to get it to work.  Currently xitami is only aware of the one 
website, although I have the directory structure already set u for the second 
site.  

I am assuming that there will be a second set of *.CFG files for the second 
site, but I'm stuck at how I get XITAMI to point to the correct site when I 
enter the website name for the second (or first) website name.

Hopefully I have stated the question clearly, but if I have not, please let 
me know and I will try to clairify the question a little better.

Brian
