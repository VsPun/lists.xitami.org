&gt;<i> Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using Xitami v2.5b5 on Win98.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been looking around quite laboriously for the
</I>&gt;<i> past few days on how to get xitami to support ASP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is what I discovered:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Halcyonsoft Instant ASP (iASP) works with Xitami
</I>&gt;<i> and MS Access 2000 (which requires ASP) - read this on
</I>&gt;<i> iASP's forum.  BUTTTTTTT ... I can't find where to
</I>&gt;<i> download a free version of iASP (i saw free version of
</I>&gt;<i> iASP on the net (version 1.08 at cnet.download.com)
</I>&gt;<i> but no longer downloadable!
</I>
I downloaded it (for work) from www.halcyonsoft.com; look for their
&quot;Developer's Edition&quot; which is a 9MB self-installing EXE file.  Only
permits ten concurrent connections.

I am having some problems with this, and am in e-mail dialogue with one
of Halcyon's people.  If anyone else *here* has experience of using iASP
with Xitami under Windoze (I'm using 2.4d9 on Win95C), I'm sure it would
be of interest to Ethereal Being and myself.

(In particular, the two &quot;problems&quot; I've found to date are:
    1) iASP doesn't provide a Content-Length HTTP header on the documents
    it serves up (even if they actually have no dynamic content at all,
    but just happen to have the .asp extension).  This results in the
    client (ie the browser) sitting there awaiting further data, until
    either it or the Xitami server decide to expire a timeout and close
    the TCP/IP channel
    2) I've been unable to instantiate a VBscript object of the RegExp
    class; e.g.
        dim reg
        set reg = new RegExp
    iASP (or something) barfs on the latter, and instead of returning the
    expected HTML, gives a message about being unable to create an
    ActiveX object.
Has anyone else had these, or similar, experiences with iASP?)
