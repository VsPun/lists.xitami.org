<PRE>Dr. Gil,

The First thing you will need to find out is if your DSL provider provides
you with a static or dynamic IP address. If you have a dynamic address, than
you will need to subscribe to a domain redirection service (bn3 is pretty
good). If you have a static IP address you have the option of running your
own DNS server (but with WinME stability could be an issue). If you choose
to run a DNS server, I suggest you buy a book on setting up a windows DNS
server as the process can be complicated and involve some steps that will
not be that easy for someone new to hosting web sites. Personally, if you
are new to this, I would go with a free redirection service like bn3 anyway,
especially if you have a static IP address. With bn3 you can redirect
<A HREF="http://www.yourdomain.com">http://www.yourdomain.com</A> to your IP address and it will work great. If you
have a Dynamic IP address, you really don't have a choice other than to go
with a redirection service like bn3. If you would like to check out bn3's
offering go to <A HREF="http://www.bn3.com">http://www.bn3.com</A>

Subject: [Xitami] Domain Recognition


Serious newbie question.  I have recently downloaded and installed Xitami's
webserver.  I have signed up for and received a personal domain.  I use
Windows ME for an OS.  I am hooked up to the internet via a DSL connection.
Now then, I have no idea in this world how to have Xitami recognize my
domain name.  Does it have to do with the network settings in my control
panel?  With my ISP?  With settings within Xitami?  What?

any and all help appreciated,
Dr. Gil
