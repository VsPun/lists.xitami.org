Under Linux creating a new process (with fork()) is almost as cheap as
creating a new thread -- which is what you said, but the emphasis is
that creating a new process is cheap.  (Starting a new program in that
process costs more; more like starting a new process in OS/2.)

Traditionally unix does not have threads, and even those unixes that do,
do not have them in a widely portable fashion.  So processes tend to get
used instead.

However as I said, Xitami tries to buck this trend and be single
threaded, single process -- which has its advantages and disadvantages.

All that said, I'm puzzled what could be causing your problem on a SMP
machine, which is fixed by running it on a single processor, if it isn't
a threading issue.  

Can you tell me what build flags you used to build Xitami?  And which
version of the compiler and build environment?
