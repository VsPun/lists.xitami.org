<PRE>There does appear to be differences - my email of 22 June mentions problems I have had with the Xitami FTP server and webcam uploads from Capturix software that works with other ftp servers but not with Xitami.

No one has replied to that message but I am interested in knowing of other ftp inconsistancies.  

Re browsing other disks I have noticed a couple of things.

Sometimes ftp servers can 'restrict to home directory' and stop browsing outside of the home directory tree defined for the user.  Other times you may not see the other disks (as ftp has roots in unix) so is not used to the disk drive letter idea but if you put 'cd d:/' it may take it and act correctly.
