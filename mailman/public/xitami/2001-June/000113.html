This is largely because no one knows the answer :-)  Windows 95/98
really are not intended for running services on them; any attempts to do
otherwise are at best somewhat hopeful and as you have found.

Basically from what I've been able to find out any &quot;services&quot; you run
under Windows 95 generally start when you log in, and stop when you log
out, and there's relatively little you can do about that.  Apparently if
you install the NT Service version (bs3224d9.exe) under Windows 95 it
will register itself in basically the way that you have found.

Alternatively you can run the DOS console version in a minimised window
as you have done (the &quot;-s&quot; switch doesn't do anything under DOS/Windows
other than print out the message you saw; it does useful things only in
Unix and OS/2).  However as you've found, it'll be stopped when the user
logs out.

Basically if you'll need to choose between: (a) having Xitami running
when a user is logged in, on a user workstation OS like Windows 95/98,
and (b) running Xitami on a more server oriented OS (Linux, Unix,
Windows NT/2000, even OS/2).

Sorry about that.  But unfortunately it's inherient in the way that
Windows 95/98 works: it's not intended to run &quot;services&quot; in the way
server OSes are, and Microsoft went to some lengths to make it more
difficult.
