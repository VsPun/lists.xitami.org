<PRE>In message &lt;00a001c0ed41$aef31fc0$<A HREF="mailto:6401a8c0@bur.adelphia.net">6401a8c0@bur.adelphia.net</A>&gt;, &quot;Jerry Richer&quot; wri
tes:
&gt;<i>and HTTP server.  When I call on the FTP server from outside the network it
</I>&gt;<i>is painfully slow.  It takes ten minutes to download a 3.5 Megabyte file
</I>&gt;<i>from the FTP server.  The network is on a cable modem and I am calling in
</I>&gt;<i>from outside the network from a computer that is also using a cable modem.
</I>
Most cable modems I've seen are fast for &quot;downloads&quot; (from the Internet
to you), and slow for &quot;uploads&quot; (from you to the Internet).  This makes
them poorly suited to hosting FTP/HTTP servers.  ADSL has the same
problem.

A common speed for the upload side is 128Kbps, which means 16KB/s.
Okay, if you're just sending a request &quot;get me this&quot;, but not okay if
you've got to send a large file.

Your 10-minutes, 3.5MB indicates a speed of about 6KB/s, or 48Kbps.
Perhaps the maximum is 64Kbps; or perhaps your cable is busy.  (With
cable you often share the upload speed with others, and sometimes the
download speed too.)

&gt;<i>I realize it's not a XITAMI problem directly but it sure makes
</I>&gt;<i>the FTP and HTTP servers almost useless.
</I>
You can eliminate Xitami from the problem by testing on the LAN; it
should be plenty fast there.  If that's the case, then you need to find
out what upload speed your cable connection has, and maybe try to
increase it.  (With the cable I have, the default is 64Kbps or 128Kbps
upload, but you can get faster upload speeds by paying more.)
