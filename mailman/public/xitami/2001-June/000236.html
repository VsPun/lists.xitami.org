<PRE>&gt;<i> I then tried the DNS approach and set virtual hosting to www2.stc.com=stc.cfg but when I typed www2.stc.com in my browser's location bar, it dialed in and tried to find it on the Internet.

You probably have a text file called &quot;hosts&quot;. On Windows NT it
may be at C:\WINNT\system32\hosts, though it has been seen under
many names. Even Lmhosts.sam (which is really for something else,
but has been known to influence IP lookup).

It looks something like this: 

# This is a sample HOSTS file ...

#  102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com      # source server

127.0.0.1       localhost

If typing &quot;localhost&quot; at your browser opens your page at
127.0.0.1, you have a hosts file somewhere (and that's why it
works). Anything on a line after &quot;#&quot; is ignored. 

Add some lines like 

127.0.0.1 manny

127.0.0.1 moe

127.0.0.1 jack

Save the file. 

Now, typing &quot;manny&quot; at your browser should open your default
127.0.0.1 page.

Now go into Xitami's Vhost settings and tell it that &quot;manny&quot;
points to a CFG file called &quot;manny.cfg&quot;. In manny.cfg, point to
&quot;O:/WebSites/mndm&quot; as the root of the web pages for that host. Do
the same for moe and jack, except point to your other web-root
folders. 

Now typing manny, moe, or jack at your browser should open three
different web sites. 

You -may- still have trouble with your TCP stack not believing
the hosts file and going to the modem to ask a &quot;real DNS&quot;. MS TCP
stacks can be quite dumb. 

When you get past that: I've had some trouble when web folders
are not on the same drive as Xitami. It &quot;should&quot; work, and often
it does, but sometimes it does not. 

Also: after setting or changing a Vhost, stop and restart Xitami.
I'm not sure if it &quot;should&quot; pick up the change on the fly, but my
habit is to force it to start anew.
