<PRE>Hi i recently found i had this problem too
ssi worked fine till i upgraded to 2.5b4 and i found myself with someone
wanting to use ssi last week and not only was it not working but it was
looking for xixssi on d drive while xitami resides on c drive and then it
was showing an error and closing .

the fix was to upgrade to 2.5b5 works just fine now.

one thing though i was testing on the users page and found it coded for *nix
they had used backticks in the ssi line while windows seems to need speech
marks eg
&lt;!--file=`/filename`--&gt; instead of &lt;!--file=&quot;/filename&quot;--&gt;
