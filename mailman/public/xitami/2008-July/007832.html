<PRE>As I long time Xitami user I consider myself well versed in configuring
Xitami. However today I ran into a problem and have yet to figure out a
solution.

 

I have using XITAMI PRO running on a server serving web pages to multiple
domains for several years. Until today only one of the domains needed SSL.
I have been running the SSL for that domain for some time with no problems,
Today I purchased a separate second certificate for the new domain, however
today try as I could  I could not get XITAMI configured for SSL on multiple
domains. The instructions state that SSL is only supported for multiple
domains when using IP based domains I have tried to do this to no avail.

 

My configuration is as follows;

First IP ADDRESS XXX.XXX.XXX.251 handles ****a.com, ****b.com and ****c.com.


****a.com has its own certificate and key referenced in sslhttp.cfs (This
Works)

Second IP ADDRESS xxx.xxx.xxx.225  handles ****d.com and I have a
certificate and key for that domain already purchased  

I tested the certificate and key globally and they work so that is not the
problem.

Try as I might I could not get the correct configuration for domain
****d.com to reference the second certificate and key. Is there anyone on
the list that can help me with the correct configuration to make this work?
The SSL instructions included with even with the PRO version of XITAMI is
not very detailed.

 

Sorry for the obfuscated IPs and domains but we are a medical company and I
need to comply with HIPPA.
