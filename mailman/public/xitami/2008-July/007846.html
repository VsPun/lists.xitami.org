<PRE>vIsTa(TM) SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROPERLY MONIKERED: 'HASTALAVISTA'. BUT, ITS NO BIG DEAL AS FAR AS X SERVER, what you use as far as an OS goes, even SUN SOLARIS EXPRESS IS GOOD SINCE XITAMI STANDS ALONE without shared .dlls or resources. Things can and will only get worse re security while online once WinDOZE '9' becomes the OS of the day. ONE PROBLEM I USED TO HAVE WITH ANY MS OS was multi-threading while on the internet, visualise all these WinDOZE services and processes running and all these ports open while running a server as well as surfing the net, whilst checking email, ftp et al. then you have stuff running in the background-maybe some apps on the taskbar loaded but minimalized or even other windows goodies open for checking email, wheather, stock ticks or(...) So what we have here (presumabley-i am no expert) is a failure to communicate, reduce the start up programs, esp defender, ms firewall and any other googey products like AV, anti-spam or anti-malware, soft firewalls etc too are culprits-put them all in the bit bucket if you are serious about running any web server. Run only hardware firewalls/with online scans. Do a port check regularly, do online webpage checks to see what the bugs are in your pages, these are free as are online AV signature audits - check to see if your ISP allows you to have your own website, if you look at the template most ISPs use it is pretty standard that you are not allowed to use port 1080/80 for bandwidth on your own server pages(...)I wrote a E-book about Xitami once and noted that a server should be not only stand-alone but running as an exclusive app, not a service and not a start-up process. Shared resources, .dll, and other things get in the way of running a web server from within, from without, echo storms ping batch files, script kitties and a host of other exploits done by ISPs and by online users (HAX) also tend to shut X-Server down or run it off course so to speak...there are a set of basic minimalist procedures I wrote about to launch any home-built website using X; I could go on and on here but to be breif, just try to run your box with ONLY X server running, all ports closed except 31/80/1080 and go from there. Just some thoughts that you may consider, thx for asking!
