Hello,,,,,   :) :)

I tried to find a search method to look in the Xitami Archives for the situation described below with no luck.

As a newbie using Xitami and Web Pages I have some experience but not a lot of day-to-day activity working with Xitami and/or HTML to find a solution for the following.

I was looking for the method in HTML to unconditionally execute a cgi program 
in html without user action (i.e.) using an &quot;image&quot;, &quot;a href&quot;, &quot;form field&quot;, etc.  

The intent is to record Xitami variables, etc. to a file on the server when the page is accessed plus in some cases output text to the Browser window that has accessed that Web Page .

Several methods were found on a google search showing SSI, etc.(#exec, etc.) and none seem to work.

The cgi program can be executed with the entry to the Browser address window of:

   <A HREF="http://IP_of_Xitami/cgi-bin/TEST_CGI_PROGRAM?Argument1+Argument2,,,,,,,">http://IP_of_Xitami/cgi-bin/TEST_CGI_PROGRAM?Argument1+Argument2,,,,,,,</A>

And, the cgi programm runs as expected with the arguments found and recorded as well as a display of text to the Browser window where the above http:// is entered.

The ADMIN of Xitami was used to review the settings for that WEB Page CGI and 
these seem to be set to cause this to happen for that WEB Page. But, I am not 
sure if a settings is required and has been overlooked and needs to be set to 
cause this to happen.

Or, the HTML code to cause this to happen has not been used properly in the HTML 
code of that WEB Page.

THANKS for your time, help, and advice!!!!   :) :)

Jerry
