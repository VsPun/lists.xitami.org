<PRE>Hello  rolinger and  Hogan Courrier ,,,,,,  :) :)

THANKS for the replies,,,,,        :) :)


Hogan,,,,,, :) :)

I'll give that link a try ----THANKS....!!!  :) :) &lt;:)



rolinger,,,,,, :) :)

For a Web Page that already exists and visited (displayed) by a Browser, it is the HTML code in that Web Page that will force the execution of a CGI without any user action that is required such as the HTML &quot;a href,,,,&quot; or &quot;form field&quot;. Also, even having to use the HTML &quot;image,,,,,&quot; (i.e.)(poking on a link, or entering data to a form field, or the action of an HTML &quot;image,,,,,URL/cgi-bin/program?argument1+Argument2,,,,&quot;). 

It is similar to the execution of a CGI counter. Most of these counters that I have seen use the HTML &quot;&lt;img src=&quot;/cgi-bin/counter?a+b+c+d,,,,&quot;&gt;&quot; which creates a graphic file containing the counter value where a,b,c,d,,, control the format of how the counter will display and then outputs that graphic file to the Web Page at the Browser.

In this case it is a simple CGI that records Xitami variables, etc. at the Xitami Server. And, the user of the Browser does not have to poke on any item (link, etc.)in the display of the Web Page for that CGI to execute. And, the HTML does not use any &quot;Image,,,,,&quot; to execute the CGI.

If you want I can send you an example of what has been tried. We even tried to see if SSI would work in the HTML of that Web Page such as:  

    &lt;!--#exec cgi=&quot;/cgi-bin/test?A+B+C&quot;--&gt;

    

Thanks for your time, help, and advice!!!!    :) :)

Jerry

&gt;<i> What do you mean 'unconditionally execute a cgi program without user 
</I>&gt;<i> interaction' ??? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CGI execution can only happen if someone goes to a website or clicks a link 
</I>&gt;<i> within a website. I suppose you could make automated calls via javascript 
</I>&gt;<i> with onMouseOver, or onMouseOut (or even a few other ones). However, all 
</I>&gt;<i> those techniques still require a user visiting the webpage just to 
</I>&gt;<i> initialize those actions. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please rephrase, clearly, what is you are looking to do.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,,,,, :) :) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tried to find a search method to look in the Xitami Archives for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation described below with no luck. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As a newbie using Xitami and Web Pages I have some experience but not a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of day-to-day activity working with Xitami and/or HTML to find a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution for the following. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was looking for the method in HTML to unconditionally execute a cgi 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; program 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in html without user action (i.e.) using an &quot;image&quot;, &quot;a href&quot;, &quot;form 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field&quot;, etc. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The intent is to record Xitami variables, etc. to a file on the server 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when the page is accessed plus in some cases output text to the Browser 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window that has accessed that Web Page . 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Several methods were found on a google search showing SSI, etc.(#exec, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc.) and none seem to work. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The cgi program can be executed with the entry to the Browser address 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window of: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://IP_of_Xitami/cgi-bin/TEST_CGI_PROGRAM?Argument1+Argument2,,,,,,,">http://IP_of_Xitami/cgi-bin/TEST_CGI_PROGRAM?Argument1+Argument2,,,,,,,</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And, the cgi programm runs as expected with the arguments found and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recorded as well as a display of text to the Browser window where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above http:// is entered. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The ADMIN of Xitami was used to review the settings for that WEB Page CGI 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these seem to be set to cause this to happen for that WEB Page. But, I am 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure if a settings is required and has been overlooked and needs to be set 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cause this to happen. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or, the HTML code to cause this to happen has not been used properly in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code of that WEB Page. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; THANKS for your time, help, and advice!!!! :) :)
