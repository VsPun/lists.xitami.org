<PRE>&gt;<i> Xitami.  Everyone recommends that you disable the FTP anyway...it never
</I>&gt;<i> worked well to begin with...but the multi-instance LRWP bug hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't interfere with any of the ISAPI stuff you are attempting to do.
</I>
FTP server sounds useful to me in some occasions but I have other
means to transfer files to a Windows box.

I'm curious though, why people want to run multiple instances of
xitami? To use a different port?

&gt;<i> If you get this ISAPI to work with Xitami def let me know...I would be
</I>&gt;<i> highly interested in getting it to work on mine server, however, I am a tad
</I>&gt;<i> put off by having to convert all my perl to some other language - mostly
</I>&gt;<i> because I don't know the other languages.  Even PHP on Xitami is a CGI
</I>&gt;<i> process - not even true PHP.  I have always been aware of the CGI
</I>
Since you are familiar with scripting languages, I would suggest you
to take a look at Python. It's a very nicely designed language and
the Python LRWP module works (in my brief testing.)

&gt;<i> performance issue and have always wanted Xitami to support alternative
</I>&gt;<i> methods - even pure PHP would be great.  But Xitami development stopped
</I>&gt;<i> several years ago and even though we loyal Xitami users have tried to get
</I>&gt;<i> iMatix to pick it up again it just hasn't panned out.
</I>
This is unfortunate.
