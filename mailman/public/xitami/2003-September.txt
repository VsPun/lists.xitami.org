I have found that despite everything Microsoft / Activestate etc. claim 
you MUST reboot the computer after you have installed perl. Oh yes and 
you'll need the v2.x microsoft MSI installer thingy unless you are 
installing on XP which already has it -

Message-ID: <3F537F82.5060102@jrwilliams.com.uy>

Good day to everyone.

Using xitami on peanut linux box,I am experiencing the following problem:

On startup, the server says

2003/09/01 12:11:28: xilrwp: ready for LRWP connections on port 81

2003/09/01 12:11:28: smtftpc: FTP service is now running

But I changed the machine's IP to 192.168.163.51
I see somewhere something has not been updated with the new IP, but I 
can't figure out what is going wrong.
This seems to be causing php to misbehave also.
Any help will be appreciated.

Hello !

There are two windows version "platform I" (win 9x, win Me) and "platform 
II" (win NTx, XP).
The difference between the two is that platform II has full support for 
services.
The windows 9x version will run on all platforms, the NT version that runs 
as a service needs platform II. This version is much more stable.

We run it on XP Pro... works great.   We tried it on ME and it ran ok.
However, ME has too many other problems.

Subject: [Xitami] Problem with refresh with php and phpbb
Message-ID: <003201c373ff$766ee660$6664a8c0@ws5>

I have been using XITAMI for a couple of years now, and have not had any
problems until I added PHP to run PHPbb.

The PHPbb application works with a couple major problems.

After trying to get help from both the PHP and the PHPBB folks with no
success, I decided to try exchanging XITAMI with the Apache server, and the
problems vanished.  It should be noted that no other change at all has been
made on the system, I can select either XITAMI or APACHE as my web server,
and I do not have to make any changes to the other software to see these
problems.

Here is the post where I describe the two problems.  I am at a loss on how
to change the XITAMI configuration to resolve these problems.  The only
thing I can think of to do is to uninstall XITAMI release 2.5b5 and give
2.4d9 a try.  Before I do that, I wanted to ask here on this list if anyone
has any ideas on what is causing these two problems.

I am having two problems with phpbb since I installed it.

I have not been able to figure out if they are related, or how to solve
either of them.

The first is fairly unimportant I think, but it may be the cause of my
second problem.

On some functions, like after I enter my login information, I get the
following message:

If your browser does not support meta redirection please click HERE to be
redirected

If I do nothing, I am taking to the forum. This same message shows up when
doing some of the administrative functions as well.

The other problem I am having is much more serious. For some reason once a
page is displayed, I can never refresh it unless I clear the cache in my
browser. For instance, If i make a mistake in a post, and do an edit, after
I complete the edit, it takes me back to the original page with the error on
it. If I click "refresh" I still get the same OLD page. If I clear the cache
in my browser, I then will get the corrected page.

Here is a copy of a previous post I made which has not received any
responses. It has the version details of the setup I am running.

--------------------------------- 

I am having the following problem, and have searched for an answer in three
different software groups and have not discovered a solution yet.

When I access a page in phpbb it displays fine, but it does not update
unless I clear the cache in my browser. (IE ver 6)

My configuration is:

WIN98
XITAMI v2.5b5
PHP 4.3.3
PHPBB 2.0.6
MYSQL 4.0.14

I have discovered that in XITAMI there is a parameter called "cache
Defaults" and if I turn this off, the codes on the requested pages change
from "304" to "200", but the actual text on the displayed page does not
change. The simplest way to observe this is to do a refresh and note that
the time never changes. However all of the icons are reloaded, you can see
them blink as they are refreshed.

I have studied the PHP.INI file, but it does not give me any positive
indicators of what may not be configured correctly. I have tried changing a
few of the parameters, all with no effect at all.

My php.ini file has only one modification, and that is the
cgi.force_redirect=0 needed to have XITAMI display any .php pages at all.

Here is the log of sending the page after clearing the cache:
192.168.100.1 - - [03/Sep/2003:03:45:41 -0500] "GET /forum/index.php
HTTP/1.1" 200 27125

Here it is after a "refresh" and the time displayed on the page never
changes: (not the time in the log trace)
192.168.100.1 - - [03/Sep/2003:03:48:32 -0500] "GET /forum/index.php
HTTP/1.1" 200 25432

In the above trace example, the time on the screen was 03:45 and two minutes
later when I did the refresh, all the icons were replaced, but the actual
page stayed the same with the 03:45 time remaining. By clearing the cache in
the browser, a new page was retrieved, and the time was then 03:49

It looks like some cache on the server is failing to send the new page to
the browser for some reason, and the only way I can get it to work is to
clear the cache. I do not have this problem going to any other forum, and I
have accessed my server using several different computers, and all have this
identical problem with any page once it has been received by the remote
computer.

Tom,

As much as I loved Xitami, and championed its usage, I also had inexplicable problems with it and PHP scripts like webmail and PhpNuke. Apache 2 would always work fine, so I just bit the bullet and went with Apache 2 for daily usage. After getting used it, it works fine...

Warren,

My concern with Apache is the statements they make about using it with WIN98
and it not being secure, and to not use it in a production environment.

I didn't find there was much to configure with Apache, just a few things I
added to make the PHP work.  I am sure if I read the manual, I would find
some other things to change, but my testing was just to see if the web
server was the problem.

Do you have any comments on using it with WIN98?

Tom R.

Tom

I did experience your same problem. I was able to fix it, though, explictly
requesting to have the page reloaded from the server ignoring any cached
information. That I did using the header function right at the very start of
the php code.
<?php
header ("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past
 header ("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");
 header ("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1
 header ("Pragma: no-cache"); // HTTP/1.0

Hope this helps.

Alejandro

Tom:

For some reason your server refuses my message, so I am writing again to the
list.

Regarding the code

 <?php
 header ("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past
 header ("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");
 header ("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1
 header ("Pragma: no-cache"); // HTTP/1.0

It MUST be the very first thing written to the page, otherwise you will get
a "header already written" error, so it is a good practice to put it right
up at the beginning of the code.
If you haven't written the program, (and by the way I don't know the
application you mention ) you could try looking at the page name that is
being cached and not refreshed, and edit the corresponding php file and add
these lines at the very top.

You would not need to add this to php files that only do internal
calculations or otherwise are not involved in any html output.

Now, if you suspect that there is more than one file involved in the
creation of the page, I would suggest you add it to every php file that
generates html content, since it should not affect the performance of the
application.

You're welcome to post any other question just as each of us is. Let me know
how it went.

Take care and good luck,

Alejandro.

Tom:

For some reason your server refuses my message, so I am writing again to the
list.

Regarding the code

 <?php
 header ("Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past
 header ("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s") . " GMT");
 header ("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1
 header ("Pragma: no-cache"); // HTTP/1.0

It MUST be the very first thing written to the page, otherwise you will get
a "header already written" error, so it is a good practice to put it right
up at the beginning of the code.
If you haven't written the program, (and by the way I don't know the
application you mention ) you could try looking at the page name that is
being cached and not refreshed, and edit the corresponding php file and add
these lines at the very top.

You would not need to add this to php files that only do internal
calculations or otherwise are not involved in any html output.

Now, if you suspect that there is more than one file involved in the
creation of the page, I would suggest you add it to every php file that
generates html content, since it should not affect the performance of the
application.

You're welcome to post any other question just as each of us is. Let me know

Alejandro,

Success, it does solve the problem on the newer release of XITAMI.  I also
discovered that release 2.4d9 does not have this problem, so it is something
that changed when they came out with release 2.5b5.

The Apache2 server also works just fine, but I did see some code in the
PHPbb modules that looks like they are doing something a little like what
you sent to me if the server is Apache2.

Not being a programmer, I did as you said, and placed it in about five of
the modules I could identify easily as generating some of the pages I am
having a problem with.  It immediatly fixed those pages, however there are
still several pages where the problem still exists.

Rather than just placing this into every module, I decided to place a
request for help on the PHPbb support forum to see if someone there knows a
more eligent way to do this.

I am a little afraid to just put it in all the modules, because I suspect
some modules call other modules, and then I should get the error you
mentioned about the header already being written.

I'll keep my fingers crossed that someone gives me some direction on which
modules to edit.  But for now, the main page is now refreshing, so 70% of
the problem is solved since that was the most noticable failure.

Tom R.

Tom,

I think it is fair to say that a true "production environment" would NOT be
running on top of Windows 98, and instead would be running on 2000, XP, or
<gasp> 2003 Server. That said, *MY* primary web server, mail server, ftp
server, printer and file sharing server, was a Win98 box for three years up
until about 6 months ago. Both with Xitami and Apache, it really was rock
stable and fast - I'd reboot it once every 60 days or so, just because it
felt right to do so - it was still working dandy.

So really, my comments are just: it works in 98 and I never observed any
security or other issues with it. Of course, my personal site only gets
around 100 web hits a day and less than 500 emails daily too. I bet Win98
would fold under a truly crushing load...

Tom, by win98 do you mean Windows 98SE?
We have used this for sometime for a scheduling app with no problem.

Subject: [Xitami] FTP upload? Virtual-Host?
Message-ID: <3F5CC207.16313.486C3BC@localhost>

Hello,

I have multiple Virtual-Host setup that I would like to create ftp for 
each (seperatly, something similar to a CVS system.) Allow for
authentication on upload but downloads can be anonymous without
password. My default.cfg has been changed because I had read
this would help secure the server. Each V-Host has its own .cfg 
aswell. Would someone please advise how this might be 
implemented...?

"Example files would be better than any explanation"

Also, has anyone written a server-side extension for Anti-Virus,
allowed IP's (configurable), etc. Ive been on the look out for 
extension (anything other than perl. or compiled code)
Is there a GSL Scripts repository somewhere? I would be happy to
host a repository if people would submit these to me.

Thanks in advance,
Euman

I have this same problem.   It happens when clicking a link to a file (not
directly typing the file's URL), and only via HTTP (not FTP).
 
I asked a few weeks ago and got nothing.  Hopefully someone will know?

I've figure out the problem myself. In the templates directory, you will
find the httpdir file. In there is the text like this;

<A HREF="$(urlbase:)$(nameurl:)"><IMG SRC="$(icon)"
BORDER=0>$(name:)</A></TD>
.   if defined (directory)

All you need to change is $(nameurl:) to $(name:) so it lookos like
this;


<A HREF="$(urlbase:)$(name:)"><IMG SRC="$(icon)"
BORDER=0>$(name:)</A></TD>
.   if defined (directory)

Regards
Dennis

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and AOL Proxy-cache
Message-ID: <3F61A03F.28497.29ADE14@localhost>

Hello,

Interesting AOL issue! AOL uses a proxy-cache system that actually somehow
starts another instance of Xitami on the same port (wierd!) I have added this to
the beginning of my Webpage

<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="private">

According to AOL this would allow the user to cache the page but not AOL.
but, wont stop the proxy.

I need help on this one, I have a couple people who just wont get rid of that
Ocean-Liner of a browser...

Thanks

Subject: Denial of service vulnerability in Xitami Open Source Web Server

Denial of service vulnerability in Xitami Open Source Web Server
================================================================

Date: 22.09.2003
=====


Affected Systems
================

The vulnerability was discovered on several versions (production and 
beta) of Xitami
webserver for Windows NT:

- Xitami 2.5B4 (bw3225b4.exe)
- Xitami 2.5B4 (bs3225b4.exe)
- Xitami 2.4D9 (bw3224d9.exe)

I did no tests with the other versions and os/platforms (OS/2, Alpha, 
OpenVMS, Unix).
Therfore i can't confirm that the vulnerability exists there.

The Problem
===========

Xitami is a multiplatform open source web server and the flagship of
iMatix.
The services crashes when it receives a http get request (to a .shtm 
file) with 
a header field of >= 5154 bytes, followed by a ":".
 
Xitami dies due to a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error, an
abnormal program termination inside XIWIN32.EXE has occurred. 
The message is *not* followed by any Win32 exception dialog.

Vendor:
=======

iMatix was informed about the vulnerability on 04.09.2003 and 05.09.2003 
via email.
Up to now, i did not receive an answer from iMatix :(

You can visit the vendors webpage here:

http://www.ximati.com
http://www.imatix.com

Other Notes
===========
Unlike some server crashes, the service process will *not* recover from 
the crash
caused by the attack.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will NOT be logged, as the
service crashes.

It seems also not to be clear, what the actual production and beta
release
versions are.
At http://www.xitami.com/download.htm, the current production is 2.4d9 
and the current
beta is 2.5b5.
At the same time, at http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm, the 
current
production is 2.5b4 and the current beta is 2.5b4?!?

Exploitation
============

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
#
# Simple exploit for Imatix Xitami Webserver on Windows NT  
#
# Sending a GET request for a *.shtm file with a header field of >= 5154 
bytes, followed by a ":",
# will crash the service.
#
# Vulnerable versions:
# - Xitami 2.5B4 (bw3225b4.exe)
# - Xitami 2.5B4 (bs3225b4.exe)

Atleast 2.4d9 running on linux aint vulnerable, did a quick test here, 
with some larger values too.

| Denial of service vulnerability in Xitami Open Source Web Server
| ================================================================
|
| Date: 22.09.2003
| =====
|
|
| Affected Systems
| ================
|
| The vulnerability was discovered on several versions (production and
| beta) of Xitami
| webserver for Windows NT:
|
| - Xitami 2.5B4 (bw3225b4.exe)
| - Xitami 2.5B4 (bs3225b4.exe)
| - Xitami 2.4D9 (bw3224d9.exe)
|
| I did no tests with the other versions and os/platforms (OS/2, Alpha,
| OpenVMS, Unix).
| Therfore i can't confirm that the vulnerability exists there.
|
| The Problem
| ===========
|
| Xitami is a multiplatform open source web server and the flagship of
| iMatix.
| The services crashes when it receives a http get request (to a .shtm
| file) with
| a header field of >= 5154 bytes, followed by a ":".
|
| Xitami dies due to a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error, an
| abnormal program termination inside XIWIN32.EXE has occurred.
| The message is *not* followed by any Win32 exception dialog.
|
| Vendor:
| =======
|
| iMatix was informed about the vulnerability on 04.09.2003 and 05.09.2003
| via email.
| Up to now, i did not receive an answer from iMatix :(
|
| You can visit the vendors webpage here:
|
| http://www.ximati.com
| http://www.imatix.com
|
| Other Notes
| ===========
| Unlike some server crashes, the service process will *not* recover from
| the crash
| caused by the attack.
|
| Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will NOT be logged, as the
| service crashes.
|
| It seems also not to be clear, what the actual production and beta
| release
| versions are.
| At http://www.xitami.com/download.htm, the current production is 2.4d9
| and the current
| beta is 2.5b5.
| At the same time, at http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index2.htm, the
| current
| production is 2.5b4 and the current beta is 2.5b4?!?

|
| Exploitation
| ============
|
| #!/usr/local/bin/perl
| #
| # Simple exploit for Imatix Xitami Webserver on Windows NT

| # Sending a GET request for a *.shtm file with a header field of >= 5154

This update is now complete, there are new releases of Xitami/2.5 and 
Xitami/2.4 on www.xitami.com.

Note that the installation procedures have changed.

If you are installing on top of an existing Windows installation, 
just unzip the packages and chuck the .exe files into the Xitami 
directory.  The single binary package contains several binaries, for 
different execution models: GUI, console, service.

If you are installing for Linux or Unix, you will have to build from 
the source kit.  It _should_ be as simple as running "sh build.sh" 
from the top-level directory but since we've changed the Xitami build 
process completely to use a new make tool (RealiBase Boom, see 
imatix.com), I expect there will be a few issues.

I haven't checked that one, but it might be a problem.

My machine handles the requests fine and I use IE 6.0 sp1.

The other machines have the same.

There is a bunch of extra formatting in the paragraph that isn't needed. If
I were you I would redo that paragraph. Also why do you have it refreshing
the content every 100 seconds? The pages load really really fast but in
looking at your source I would get rid of some of that extra formatting
stuff. It's not a problem with Xitami.

I haven't checked that one, but it might be a problem.

My machine handles the requests fine and I use IE 6.0 sp1.

The other machines have the same.

the page stops loading at the word associated and appears to display a font

Mozilla 1.4, AOL 9.0, and IE 6.0 sp1 read the pages fine from here.  
Netscape 4.7 does not get the Flying American flags near the top of  
http://www.ecs.k12.ny.us and neither the flags or logo at the top of  
http://www.ecs.k12.ny.us/eritwo/index.htm, but the other animated

Hello,

Interesting AOL issue! AOL uses a proxy-cache system that actually somehow
starts another instance of Xitami on the same port (wierd!) I have added this to
the beginning of my Webpage

<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="private">

According to AOL this would allow the user to cache the page but not AOL.
but, wont stop the proxy.

I need help on this one, I have a couple people who just wont get rid of that
Ocean-Liner of a browser...

Thanks

Message-ID: <LPBBKDJEMJGLJKHLEAEOMEJLCAAA.gchisum@elite.net>

Hello:

I have installed the bw3225b4 zip. When I enter information into the alias
section and save them, they are not saved to the config. The only way I
could get Xitami to work was to manually edit the defaults.cfg.

Also, I need to run several different php-based applications. How can I do
this? I am running on a standalone machine to develop some new apps.

Any ideas would be appreciated.

NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS: What was xi win32.exes (the actual server) is 
xigui32.exe in the 2.4.d10 release just posted.  This is change from the 
2.4.d7 version I was running and maybe other versions.  Since I start 
the server from a desktop icon all I had to do was change the shortcut, 
others may have to do something additional.

Also, neither of the 2.4 or 2.5 zip files released today appear to have 
the installer included.  A major reason that I'm running Xitami is the 
installer had it up and running in under 10 minutes for a newbie to web 
servers.  Without the installer features it is hard to recommend Xitami 
to other newbies.

I am not reporting any problems with Xitami, just wanted to share something
with you :)))
I just tried the new "ZIP" release and i like that it doesn't require
installation.
So from today i'm running 10 xitami servers on the same IP (machine) on
different ports and combining them all with reverse proxy on port 80 for
load balancing and on each Xitami i have persistant CGI written in perl on
LRWP port...
The server is Windows 2000 Workstation, Celleron 2Ghz and 512 RAM...
I could not bellive that this monster can do around 500 or maiby more
connections per second now with CGI (active pages) :)))

Great work guys from Imatix :)))

a good workaround to get my counters and forms working?

Hello Pieter Hintjens et all,

Im not sure you have given thought to Xitami running well on any other
browser
than IE6+. I have Netscape 7.1 and it takes virtualy forever for a single 6k
page
to load and my PHP site is all screwed up with the new version under
Netscape.
I would assume Opera will have the same issue as it too runs Mozilla 5+.

Any thoughts, suggestions, patches, regroup and punt?
Euman

I'm not sure what the problem is with NS 7.1.  As I reported for a 
previous question, I've tested with IE, Mozzilla 1.4, AOL 9.0, and NS 
4.76 and all seem to take about the same time to load pages, with only 
4.76 having a problem with some graphics and I believe that is a 4.76 
specific issue with the way the page is laid out..

What is the URL to your page having problems?

Hello John,

the url is:
http://h2osoft.homeip.net

if you were to click on the "Working Forum" link this would take you into
my PHP forum.

In Netscape the images are really messed up as I said earlier.

We use Mozilla mainly, MSIE in some cases, and we test regularly with 
Opera and other browsers.

I'm surprised to hear that your web site works differently with the 
new version of Xitami, but it is possible.  The timeout problem 
sounds like your page (PHP) is not providing a valid content-length 
header.  You might want to (a) disable keep-alives, (b) enable 
debugging and take a look at the log files to see exactly what 
headers are being sent back to the browser.

If you find something specific that Xitami is doing wrong, we'll fix 
it.

In the install package you will find three binaries, the service 
version is called xisrv32.exe.  Place this file in your Xitami 
directory, then register it this as a service from a command prompt:

  xisrv -i

Stop the old service, start the new one, test that it works.

not sure what that means.

I have the refresh every 100 seconds in the page because for some reason in the 
past some machines were not getting updates of the webpage. I'm finding that if I 
rename the page from default to say, homepage.html, the users with the display 
problems get the entire page. When I rename it back to default the problem comes 
back.

Hello Pieter,

I never recieve 411 Length Required
The "Content-Length" is not defined.
The server will not accept the request without it.

For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests containing
a message-body MUST include a valid Content-Length header field unless the
server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. If a request contains a
message-body and a Content-Length is not given, the server SHOULD respond
with 400 (bad request) if it cannot determine the length of the message, or
with 411 (length required) if it wishes to insist on receiving a valid
Content-Length.

I assume you are asking for this line of the debug.log that could be the
cause of the
problem but from the statment above this shouldnt matter...?
Transfer file=[virtual-host]/index.htm size=-1 from=0

When I look at the Xitami Source, you do not use Content-Length either.

Im at a loss for why the newest version doesnt like my pages using Netscape
but MSIE is perfectly fine. It should be worth mentioning, 2.5b5 worked
very nicely on Netscape, Opera and IE...

I was using version 2.4d9 for a long time now without a single crash ever.

P4 512 mb XP and Xitami handling cgi php and coldfusion fine.

When I try to upgrade to 2.4d10, it seems to work fine, but the version
display is 2.4d7 ...?

Well I decided to give 2.5b6 a shot installing the new version.

I could enter into de web based admin page to see the new features I´ve
never seen before.

The problem is that this version can´t (on my server) handle certain images
and no flash pages at all.

I then come back to the old version and is working again, but what in the
heck is wrong with version 2.5, and why version 2.4d10 shows 2.4d7 instead?

Thanks:

Carlos

For those that don't know, reverse proxying is a way to connect
multiple servers on multiple ports on same machine to one port
or multiple servers on the local intranet to one port on one machine
connected on the internet.
So you need just one IP :)))

Here you have link for nice small and fast reverse proxy for HTTP protocol
http://www.at32.com/doc/rproxy.htm
Read the details on their page. You can also download demo version and test
it :)))
It's really neat stuff if you want to beat the number of connections really
cheap.

I took this desktop picture, if you like to see how it looks like having
10 xitamis, 10 cgis with LRWP and reverse proxy all tegether :)))
Click on this link to view the picture
http://www.normstudio.com/10servers.jpg

Now i have another problem - how to increase bandwith.
I'm looking for solution that has something with compressing html pages
before you send them so you could send 10 times less data... Or maybe just
some ballancing with server machines on different providers.

I'm having a world of difficulties with the new packages as well, under 
winxp and win2003 machines, all have xitami running as a service, tried 
upgrading by overwriting files, adding new files, and reinstalling the 
service, but had alot of problems

Is there any chance that an installer will be built that can handle both new 
installs and upgrades ?

Is this reverse proxy a part of the new Xitami or is this a different 
program?  Sounds interesting.  Please explain more! :)

What problems have you had, specifically?  Remember, you cannot mix 
files from 2.4 and 2.5, for such an upgrade you should install 2.5 in 
a separate directory and copy your webpages, scripts, and 
configuration files across.

To debug (config and other) problems with the service version, run it 
as a normal console process.  To do this, pause the service (if it's 
running), then open a console window, and run the service in debug 
mode in the Xitami directory:

  xisrv32 -d

Whatever information you can provide about the problems you're having 
will help us make such a thing.

Not important, the version numbering in the web-based admin is just  
not correctly updated.

There seems to be a problem in 2.5 sending certain files (see the 
other comments here).

Mozilla and AOL read your pages fine.  NS 4.76 won't bring up 
http://h2osoft.homeip.net (blank page with done in the status line) but 
typing in http://h2osoft.homeip.net/phpbb2/index.php does bring up the 
page and will connect to subsequent pages.  I don't think the problem is 
Xitami, rather Netscape doesn't like something in the html coding.

It's a product from another company, just follow the link and read.
http://www.at32.com/doc/rproxy.htm

Xitami is really great for running multiple instances at the same time on
one machine.
Reverse proxy is used to glue them together on port 80 with conditions you
set up.

seems the tar.gz is missing the C script file thats executed from boomake
to call gcc. in both 2.5c0 and the 2.4d10 package , so It cant be compiled.
