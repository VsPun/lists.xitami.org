It loads so fast locally would a stall be so obvious?

Perhaps it is having a hard time loading a specific image because it 
chokes trying to decode it.  You might have an image format Opera 
struggles with.  Images can contain a multitude of sins.  

Could be java.  Could be loading an offsite image via java.  It sure 
isn't Xitami.

By process of elimination the culprit will quickly emerge.  Start 
clean and re-insert html code until Opera chokes.  Bingo.  

As a truism, all the software I write works great locally.  It's only my 
customers who have problems.
