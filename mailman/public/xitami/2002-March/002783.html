<PRE>&gt;<i> what type of machine everyone is running xitami on. I'm thinking
</I>&gt;<i> about a pentium 233 with 128 MB RAM.
</I>
&gt;<i> dual PIII 700's - ancient 75Mhz pentium with 32MB memory - 200MHz
</I>&gt;<i> MMX, 96 MB RAM -  P500Mhz with 128 Ram -  P 200 mmx 96Mb
</I>
Pentiums? DUAL Pentiums?

I got into Xitami because it runs WELL (serving static pages) on a
386SX-16 with 4 Megs RAM. Inside the building I could just tell the
difference between that throw-away 386 and a Pentium running PWS.
Outside the building, most users said it was faster than most large
servers.

If you have forgotten how slow a 386SX-16 is... NetScape 3.0 took
over a minute to load a very simple page of HTML. It was an awful
machine for browsing, but a fine server.

Xitami isn't the issue.

CGI/filters can be. Until last September I was running a university
departmental site on a P-133, 32 Megs memory, filtering most pages
through a Visual Basic filter, and speed was not an issue. I don't
have a total hit-count but the top page got 50,000 hits in 3 years,
and typical visitors hit 10 pages with several to many images per
page, or thousands of files delivered per day. And it stood up fine
to the initial onslaught of CodeRed, hundreds of stupid hits per
hour.
