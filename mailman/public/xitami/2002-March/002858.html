<PRE>{ SEQ CHAPTER \h \r 1}     I run Xitami for OS/2 ( OS/2 has always run very stability for me in the past and I 
have never wanted to change from something that &quot;worked very well&quot; for me).  Xitami 
runs completely dedicated on it's own machine (Pentium 100 with 32 megs of ram) 
running OS/2 Warp 4.0 .  I recently upgraded my feed to a 768 SDSL net connection to 
host some original artwork.  When up and running I am expecting anywhere from 10-20+ 
simultaneous connections during normal peak usage hours.  

     I have two concerns.  One: some of those connecting will be broadband connections.  
Won't the broadband connections take the lion share of the bandwidth (being able to 
take more faster in shorter time frame) leaving the dialups with the scraps of what they 
can down feed in a bandwidth crunch?  Is there a way under Xitami or OS/2 to make 
sure everyone gets an even amount of bandwidth at peak usage (unless this is done 
normally) or throttle bandwidth per connection to a specific kb (say 8 kb) all the time?  

     My second question is I saw in the faq that EMX was limited to 40 open sockets in 
the faq.  This has been in the faq for a LONG time.  Has the newer versions of EMX 
made improvements on this?  Also is that 40 sockets per EMX application or the entire 
machine?  I'm wondering if this 40 max sockets will hit me.

     I am not opposed to running Xitami under Windows if I have to.  If possible I would 
like to stay with OS/2 as I have left it running for over a year without even so much as 
having to reset the server.  My experience with running Xitami under NT 4 was it would 
run fine for a week to a month then Xitami would suddenly stop taking connections.  But 
everything would look like it was still running fine.  However if it turns out my only option 
is to switch perhaps there are some settings that can improve reliability?

Thanks very much anyone for any information!  Gene Angel
