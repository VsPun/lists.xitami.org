<PRE>set up a vhost to the intranet ip or intranet host name to point to the
intranet site....then go to the xitami directory, you should see .cfg and
.aut files for the stuff you just created...you can then manually edit the
vhost's .aut (usually the name you gave when you configured it, so if you
made it use local.cfg..you'd edit local.aut) and it's really simple..you can
look at aut files....or in the webadmin..change defualts.aut to whatever the
filename is and edit that way.

&gt;<i> ok people... i must really be stupid because i am really having a tough
</I>time
&gt;<i> figuring this out. the answers i've been given sound really simple. so can
</I>&gt;<i> some one give me some specifics...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> problem - i have and intranet for the company. currently it is open to the
</I>&gt;<i> internet. i want all employees to be able to access it. the problem is
</I>that
&gt;<i> i want to restrict public access to the site by using passwords. people in
</I>&gt;<i> the office should be able to access the site as normal (no password
</I>prompt),
&gt;<i> but people accessing it from the internet should be prompted before access
</I>&gt;<i> is given.i would like to have people access the site using the same
</I>&gt;<i> urlregardless of their location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the webmask command seems to only lock out ip ranges.... i want to set
</I>&gt;<i> certain ip ranges to be (or not be) prompted for passwords.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the solution i was given was to use 2 aliases - both point to the same
</I>data.
&gt;<i> one protected by a webmask the other protected by passwords. i think this
</I>&gt;<i> would work - but then people would need to remember 2 urls... one for
</I>inside
&gt;<i> and one for outside - right? and they would have to know which one to use
</I>&gt;<i> and when... (intranet.domain.com/public   intranet.domain.com/private)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the other solution i've come up with is duplicate the intranet webserver.
</I>&gt;<i> one inside the network and one out in the DMZ. that way 1 url, and the
</I>&gt;<i> correct dns entries... but i would have to make sure i kept both sites
</I>&gt;<i> identical and i would need another pc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> any more ideas or help?
</I>&gt;<i>
