</I>If you are planning on hosting mainly static pages the machine you are 
thinking of is sufficiently fast that your bottleneck will be the 
internet not your machine.

If you are planning on more dynamic content (i.e. CGIs perl etc) then 
your mileage will vary based on the efficiency of your dynamic content 
and how many hits are CGI vs static, but if you dedicate the machine to 
being a webserver (no mail,ftp...) then this should be quite OK for a 
site that is connected to the internet by something less than say a 
10Mbps ethernet pipe. Personally I have  run a small website including 
perl CGIs on an ancient 75Mhz pentium with 32MB memory and win95 OSR2. 
As long as it wasn't doing ANYTHING except Xitami/perl that was fine but 
it got a bit bogged down as soon as I tried to run another app.
