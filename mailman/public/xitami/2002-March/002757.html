<PRE>&gt;<i> I recently started using Opera 6.01. (Boy, is it great, but that's another
</I>&gt;<i> story.) When I view my home page in Opera, there is a problem. The page
</I>&gt;<i> usually (90% of the time) stalls when downloading, 
</I>
On one of my machines I'm running Xitami under Windows 2000, and use Opera 
6.00 or 6.01 to mange the machine, from that machine.  I've had no problems.

I can tell you that 6.01 has a serious denial of service problem that was 
not in 6.00.  I filled a bug report over a week ago and have heard nothing 
from the opera people.  I would use 6.00, I would not use 6.01.

Always run the program 'tidy' over your sources before using them.
