<PRE>I have a little old P133 with about 96 megs of ram and a pair of 2 gig
drives running Win98. This pathetic pizza-box machine built with cast off
parts has been running non-stop for two years with various Linuxes and
Windows before settling on Win98 now. It runs Xitami, PHP, a mail server, an
FTP server, a remote access server, plus it acts as a shared drive for my
lan and a laser printer server. It also used to be my firewall for my LAN
before I got a Linksys DSL Router. I restart it once every 40 days or so
just because it feels good. It runs no foreground applications.

I get no more than 15 unique web page visitors a day, but it deals with
thousands of emails a week no sweat. SOME complicated PHP applications seem
to take too long, but other complicated PHP applications blast through
rather quickly - I need to figure out why that is.

Hope this helps,
Warr

</I>&gt;<i> I'm just curious to see what type of machine everyone is running xitami
</I>&gt;<i> on.  I want to get an old system just to host a website, but want to be
</I>&gt;<i> sure it will handle it.  I'm thinking about a pentium 233 with 128 MB RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>  Let me know what processor, RAM, hard drive, ...etc you have.  Also, how
</I>&gt;<i> many hits per day does it handle without slowing down, crashing, etc.
