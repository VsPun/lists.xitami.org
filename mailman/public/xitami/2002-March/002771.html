<PRE>Hello,

I have a web-based application that I use for our employees to do their daily work.  
Whenever they make an entry, I use the REMOTE_USER variable to capture which 
employee is doing the work.  Up until March 5, this was working fine.  However, on 
March 5th I created an SSL certificate (private) and issued it to everyone so 
everyone would be logging in via HTTPS.  Now the REMOTE_USER field is always 
coming up as -

Configuration notes - 

I have the directory aliased.

They type in <A HREF="http://www.yourplace.org/db">http://www.yourplace.org/db</A>

That takes them to c:\xitami\webpages\db.shtml

which in turn redirects them to <A HREF="https://www.yourplace.org/cgi-bin/db/index.shtml">https://www.yourplace.org/cgi-bin/db/index.shtml</A>

/cgi-bin/db/ is a protected directory so it prompts them for their user name and 
password

once entered, all of the URL's they access are in the protected directory


So my question, summarized, is, why is the REMOTE_USER information getting lost 
since I switched to SSL and how do I get it back because it's incredibly critical to our 
daily operations?
