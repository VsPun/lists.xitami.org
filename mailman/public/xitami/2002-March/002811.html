<PRE>ok people... i must really be stupid because i am really having a tough time
figuring this out. the answers i've been given sound really simple. so can
some one give me some specifics...

problem - i have and intranet for the company. currently it is open to the
internet. i want all employees to be able to access it. the problem is that
i want to restrict public access to the site by using passwords. people in
the office should be able to access the site as normal (no password prompt),
but people accessing it from the internet should be prompted before access
is given.i would like to have people access the site using the same
urlregardless of their location.

the webmask command seems to only lock out ip ranges.... i want to set
certain ip ranges to be (or not be) prompted for passwords.

the solution i was given was to use 2 aliases - both point to the same data.
one protected by a webmask the other protected by passwords. i think this
would work - but then people would need to remember 2 urls... one for inside
and one for outside - right? and they would have to know which one to use
and when... (intranet.domain.com/public   intranet.domain.com/private)

the other solution i've come up with is duplicate the intranet webserver.
one inside the network and one out in the DMZ. that way 1 url, and the
correct dns entries... but i would have to make sure i kept both sites
identical and i would need another pc.

any more ideas or help?
