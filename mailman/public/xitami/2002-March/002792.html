<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm thinking about a pentium 233 with 128 MB RAM.
</I>
&gt;<i> I plan on running W2K pro on this machine. There will be PHP as CGI
</I>&gt;<i> and possibly an FTP server as well (not xitami). I don't expect a
</I>&gt;<i> ton of hits per day (&lt; 20). I suppose a mail server is always
</I>&gt;<i> possible down the road.
</I>
Xitami is hardly an issue in this case. You will however find W2K a
hair pokey at the console. I just put XP on a K6/2-400 as an
experiment, and it don't stink (after I got more than 64M RAM in it)
but it isn't a machine I'd fly every day after being spoiled by a
Celeron 1Gig. I ran W2K on P-200 for a short time and it didn't stink,
just not as snappy as newer CPUs.

But I've run Xitami on 386SX-16 and 486-33. Installation seemed to
take forever on the 386, and slogging around NT4 on a souped-up 486
demands calm patience, but Xitami flew fine and fast.

The MP3 files should not be an issue unless you use a bloated MP3
server. Audio rates are no problem for modern networks or a P-233.

My mail server runs on PPro-233 and everything is &quot;instant&quot;, but the
traffic there is too small to be a real test.

I say just do it. By the time you get enough CGI and other frills
loaded on to make any load worth frettting about, GigaHertz PCs will
be in trashbins looking for good homes.
