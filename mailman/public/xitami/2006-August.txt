Dear All,

    It Looks Like I finger this out on my Own. I have Discovered that my AutoExec Bat had been Destroyed and so with no pathing info being set up on start up. xitami could not find what it needed to run my scripts from a command line point of view. 

If I have overlooked anything while I was fixing this situation, please let me know, Mean while everything is working Fine.

  I am running: Xitiami v2.4d9 
  on Win 98
  I am using Purl (can't give you the version because of this problem? I think its 6)

  So Story,
  I have been running this set up for a couple of years and it has worked perfectly, no problems.
  then a few days ago I was testing an old script I had written (on this same system) that lets the user upload files to a server, but the length of the files were 0bits even though this had worked fine before. But that not the real Problem.

  The Real Problem happened today!
  The Server has stopped running any of my purl scripts. and for no reason, I almost never touch anything in the control panel and have not even opened it for atleast a year. I have check perl and it dos run from Dos. I have re-installed xitami Raw, I can log onto its Control panel, I can open HTML pages in the CGI-BIN directory though the server. But when I submit something that worked Yesterday (or was written over a Year ago) I get the standard (500 Can't find File Error) and it comes up really fast. Hear are some stuff from the Logs 

  example: log_in.html call acount_prosser.pl using get method.

  request.log
  GET /cgi-bin/nlcart/underground_a/accounts_panel/acount_prosser.pl?log_username=a&log_password=a&B1=Log+In&pageid=login HTTP/1.1

Ron,

it's not the answer you are looking for, but I just read today a little
about JSP (Java Servlet Pages) which does the same as ASP, as I understood
it correct. I don't have any clue of ASP /JSP but would JSP be not an
alternative ?

Subject: [Xitami] Xitaimi Bug ?? calling URLs twice
Message-ID: <BAY105-DAV16527E6072EA82967B2329F8530@phx.gbl>

I am not certain if this is a problem of Xitami or not, but I am beggining
to think it is.  Here is the situation.

On a Frame page labeled "mainDisplay" page is:
<head>
      <script language="JavaScript">
         function countStat() {
            parent.mainDisplay.statPage.location =
"/cgi-bin/countStat.pl?cid=4&amp;fid=42&amp;pid=6746" ;
         }
      </script>
</head>

And then in the BODY i have:

<input type="image" onClick="javascript:countStat();"
SRC="/images/gifs/playpause.gif" border="0" height="12" title="Play/Pause">
<IFRAME NAME="statPage" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" margin="0" width="1"
height="1" SRC="/blank.html"></IFRAME>

When the user clicks the button, the JS functions calls the defined URL to
the IFrame, the called URL runs a script that counts the button click to a
DB.  Normally, the iFrame is hidden (note the iframe elements), but for
testing I expanded the iFrame to: width="150" height="25" and then printed
out the results of the mysql query and click count.  As an example, if the
current DB.table.buttonClick = 10, then I would get the buttonClick
variable, print it, increment it, rewrite it to the DB and then print the
incremented variable.  So on the in the iFrame I would see: "10 and 11".  I
then go and look at the mysql table.buttonClick value, and it shows "12".

After many frustrating hours of troubleshooting, I found that the mysql logs
show the "increment" happening twice (update table set
buttonClick=buttonClick+1 where ...).  I then looked at the Xitami
access.log and discovered that everytime the "image" is clicked, the script
is running TWICE.  Somehow one button click using onClick is causing the
script to be called and run twice, thus the buttonClick value is being
incremeted by two on every click.

For the life of me i can't figure out why its occuring twice.  Even more, if
it was being called twice IN the iFrame, then the printed variables would
be: "10 and 11" followed by a "11 and 12"...but the results are always from
the first time its run, in this example it would always show "10 and 11".
Because I never see the results of the second run ("11 and 12") it is making
me believe the Xitami is somehow calling the script twice but only sending
the results of the first call to the iFrame window.   I can't think of or
see any other explanation as to why this is happening.

Any insights into this problem are highly welcomed and needed.   I wonder if
anyone else can replicate this problem....I firmly believe this is somehow
related to Xitami handling frame URL calls.  There is nothing in my HTML
that indicates one button click would cause the script to be called twice.

Thanks everyone,
Russel

PS: Assuming I can get all this to work, this method is a neat little trick
that replaces SSI (server side includes) and allows me to do statistical
tracking well beyond SSI capabilities.

is very interesting. Are  you sayin that you can run ASP script in it?

JSP is simply another way to get server side processing. It is not 
compatible in any way, shape or form with ASP. However, you canuse 
Chilisoft ASP (now SunONE ASP) to get ASP support on non-MS servers:
http://www.sun.com/software/chilisoft/

The problem with Xitami and all server side stuff (ASP, PHP, JSP) is 
that it runs the interpreters as CGI processes, meaning it has to 
start a new process for every request. This kills performance with 
slower servers or busy sites.

I would run PHP with Xitami. I don't trust JSP and ASP is 
proprietary.

I get so many requst for ASP compatibility I had to get a server that will
run it and I'm trying Apache/ASP but I'm not real happy with it. I may end
up doing (YUK) IIS just so I can have the ASP functionality I need.  I've
been requestion Xitami ASP for years now and still don't have a good
solution. On my home box I run Xitami and IIS on another port. Not a great
solution.

Russel,
Xitami does no JavaScript or Frame processing whatsoever. It's pure client side technology.
Can it be that your browser so smart, that it remembers that content of IFRAME is no longer "blank.htm" and while rerendering page calls IFRAME with new CGI URL... again?

I have since learned its not a Xitami issue but it is a problem related to
the browsers.  IE/NS and FF all do the same thing and call the URL twice to
the iFrame.  I don't know why or how though.  The best I have been able to
research is that it has something to do with httprequest processing the URL,
then the a second time to pass it the iFrame.  Or rather vise versa - the
first run of the script writes the correct printed variables to the browser
window, but then the database always shows the count one higher than it
should be, which means the second run of the script isn't getting passed to
the browser - but something else is calling it and causing the script to
execute a second time.

Not many documented cases (google search) of people discovering this problem
and I haven't been able to come up with a fix.  But this problem can be
replicated using iframes anywhere.  I have been trying to get others to
create a test page with an iframe to replicate what I have found, and then
check their web logs to see that one click to the iframe is calling the URL
twice.

Because I am using this method as a client side statistics counter (written
to a db), my numbers are double what they should.  I suppose I could always
divide by two to get the accurate number, but I don't like the fact that the
URL (a script) is getting executed twice - processor and memory usage
becomes a problem during heavy loads.
