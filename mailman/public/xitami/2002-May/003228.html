<PRE>I posted this last week and didn't get a response.  Hopefully folks havn't
gone off for Memorial Day.

I am using DNS virtual hosts for students in my senior projects class.
What I want is for each team to have its own password for its own directory.
Pre-VHosts, that was no problem, I just put the directory name and password
into defaults.aut

Now, I have a virtual hosts setup where:

ProjectsTeam08.ewu.edu points to the \Webpages\Team08 directory, etc

This works fine, once the Xitamites solved some Win 95 network configuration
problems (thanks guys)

Unfortunately, there appears to be no longer any password protection.
My current setup looks like this:

1. Each team has its own .cfg file that points to its own .aut file:
[Server]
    Cgi-bin = &quot;C:/Xitami/webpages/team08/cgi-bin&quot;
    Hostname = &quot;projects.ewu.edu&quot;
    Webpages = &quot;C:/Xitami/webpages/team08&quot;
[Security]
    Admin = &quot;0&quot;
    Filename = &quot;team08.aut&quot;

2. The team's .aut file holds the passwords
#   Created by Virtual Host wizard
[/Admin]
    admin=-
[/setup]
    team08=&quot;Rj4Qx56M&quot;

3. In defaults.cfg I reference the config files
[Virtual-hosts]
    ProjectsTeam08.ewu.edu = &quot;team08.cfg&quot;
and the standard .aut file
[Security]
    Filename = &quot;defaults.aut&quot;
which still holds the passwords from the pre VHosts days
[/team08]
    team08=&quot;Rj4Qx56M&quot;

Presumably I am not referencing something properly somewhere or havn't set a
flag right.  I thought it might be the [/setup] line in the team .aut file,
but I have played around with that ( /team08, etc) with no luck.  I have
gone through the help files and my archive of Xitami mailing list messages,
with no luck. I rolled the system back to the old setup, but I'd really like
individual logs to be available.  Any idea where else I can look?
