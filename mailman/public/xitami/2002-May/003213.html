<PRE>As I understand it (from previous discussions) is that the *.cgi &amp; *.cgo files
are a fact of life with that version. You can't turn the output off. I have
however discovered that in the cfg file that you can specify which directory
that they are put in - which is what I do. I host a site that runs an
intensive .pl script that outputs hundreds (sometimes thousands)of the cgi &amp;
cgo files a day. I also discovered that they will get overwritten at a certain
point in a FILO fashion leaving a constant 1000 files or so in that directory.
I do have to restart Xitami once a week to get the memory release and I then
clear out the cgi and cgo files so that they can start at zero again.

 &gt; Can anyone tell me how I can go about turning off creation of pipe####.cgo
 &gt; and pipe####.cgi files?  (#### is an instance counter, e.g., 0001, 0002,
 &gt; ..., 1000)

 &gt; I have Xitami 2.5b5 running on WinXP.

 &gt; These files are being created in the Xitami main program directory, not in
 &gt; my specified temp, cgi-bin, or http-root directories.

 &gt; They are being created every time a Perl CGI script that I am using for
 &gt; navigation runs, which is leading to a large number of files being
 &gt; created.

 &gt; I was hoping that this was the result of inadvertently turning on the
 &gt; debug option for cgi, but alas, that option was already turned off.

 &gt; If this is a bug in the code that someone has already discovered, please
 &gt; let me know which module it is in so I can go fix it and recompile.

 &gt; Thanks much!!!
