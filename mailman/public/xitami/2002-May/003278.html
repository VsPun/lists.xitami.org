<PRE>I use a Linksys cable router. Would this idea of ftp using various ports
(if I read this message correctly) be a likely reason that I can (from
the outside) connect to Xitami's ftp (running on an odd port, 384) but
when my client requests a &quot;list&quot; I get no response? I do have the port
384 mapped. The system works fine and I get ftp lists when Xitami is
running on it's normal ports (80, 21). I have to use an odd port due to
cable blocking 80. Currently I am using a free generic ftp server to get
around this. I like Xitami's though because it is so easy to setup
usernames and passwords.

Thanks in advance.

Different firewalls are different also as far as the firewalling
rulesets and how they deny or reject packets - you should refer to your
firewall documentation.
It's impossible to try and figure out what ports the FTP server will
need to do it's data transfer and then attempt to open those ports....
If you're using one of the cheap cable/DSL routers
