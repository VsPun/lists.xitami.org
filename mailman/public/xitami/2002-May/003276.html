<PRE>Thanks Thomas and all who've answered. I hope I'm not wasting your time here
but I really like this product (Xitami). I guess I was wondering why I was
getting this problem with Xitami and not with Apache or IIS? Do they somehow
generate headers for filtered content telling the browser not to cache it?
Also, (and this may expose my ignorance) how would the browser know that a
PHP file has been modified? I guess I'm surprised that if I modify the file
it will always be re-processed the first time after and my browser will see
the modification.

&gt;<i> I've had the same thing happen on occasion.  The problem is that the
</I>&gt;<i> browser cache is pulled up instead of the PHP page.  It really is annoying
</I>&gt;<i> since the databases I use show that the entries were entered properly.
</I>So,
&gt;<i> my solution is to put a &quot;refresh&quot; link that will update the page, which
</I>&gt;<i> works but is not attractive for those who have to use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps!
</I>
