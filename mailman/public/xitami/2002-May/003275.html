&gt;<i>hi Hace,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>thanks for getting back to me and sorry if I was unclear. The problem I was
</I>&gt;<i>having is that indeed I only got a new processed version when the file
</I>&gt;<i>itself changed. The reason this was not helping me is that the file was
</I>&gt;<i>pulling information from a database and the database was changing. Just
</I>&gt;<i>because the PHP file itself did not change didn't mean that it shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i>re-processed. Whenever I changed the file itself (I just added a space
</I>&gt;<i>character at the end of a line) sure enough the PHP file was re-processed
</I>&gt;<i>and I got the latest info from the database.
</I>
I've had the same thing happen on occasion.  The problem is that the
browser cache is pulled up instead of the PHP page.  It really is annoying
since the databases I use show that the entries were entered properly.  So,
my solution is to put a &quot;refresh&quot; link that will update the page, which
works but is not attractive for those who have to use it.

Hope this helps!
