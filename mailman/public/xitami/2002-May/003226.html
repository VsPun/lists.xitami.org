<PRE>I was recently having a problem with missing hard disk space. So, I asked a
friend (who uses my server) to see if he could find the problem as I was too
busy...he said fine...here's his AIM message response (named edited) I was
wondering if anyone could give me more info:


Ax: c:\xitami\memtrace.lst was 25.7GB in size
Ax: dont know what it was for but it was increasing by the minute
Ax: so i deleted it
Ax: so u wouldnt get any errors or crash
Ax: google says its Xitami's core dump file, whatever that is
Ax: look in settings and disable core dumping maybe?
Me: ok, thanks a lot man
Ax: no problem, hope everything goes well now
Ax: it was fairly easy to find
Ax: i just went to properties on every sub directory directlt under the c:
until i saw one that was huge in size....xitami was, so i checked xitami's
root directory first and there it was, 25.7 fucking gigabytes. I'm wondering
if someone had a few terrabytes of a hard drive if it would fill that up
too, jeez...i guess it dumped all activity to one file.
