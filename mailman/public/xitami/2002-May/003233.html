There's a school of thought regarding running a name service daemon that
if one isn't totally confident of what everything does, one shouldn't
even be contemplating doing it :-)

Can you beg, borrow, steal (or buy) a copy of &quot;DNS and BIND&quot;, by Cricket
Liu &amp; Paul Albitz?  It's published by O'Reilly, and is well worth the
money.  DON'T buy the version for WindowsNT (unless you're contemplating
running the NT named); the &quot;ordinary&quot; version provides a much better
insight into just why any (or all:-) of the RRs exist.

[Somewhat belated response since I'm about a week behind on reading the
mailing list.  Sorry if someone's already given you the same advice.]
