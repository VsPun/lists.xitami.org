Subject: [Xitami] Am I doing something wrong?
Message-ID: <49B7572F.2030407@wayback.net>

I was signed up for this list a few years ago and recall it being 
relatively active.  I'm still using an old version of Xitami for better 
or worse -- mostly better as far as I can tell.

I saw that a new version has been released and thought it would be a 
good time to re-subscribe to the list but it's been a couple of weeks 
and all I've received was the initial acknowledgment email telling me 
that I have successfully subscribed.

So my question is:  is the list dead or am I mis-configured somehow and 
just not receiving it?  I'm really interested in hearing what folks may 
have to say about version 5.  I'd love to be able to get it working 
under Ubuntu but I've never had any luck compiling the software for 
myself.  The system I do have working was pre-compiled and part of the 
basic installation under a-linux.

Thanks
       Mike

This list is not dead, it's just asleep!  :-)

You should be able to build X5, and it does run (it's running the
legacy.xitami.com site right now, and seems to be pretty stable, just
serving static HTML pages).

Why not try building and let us know what happens.  I'll walk you
through any problems you hit.

the list is still here - just not very busy nowadays.

ver 5 was just released and the website has been updated - but it's still 
the initial beta release. there is also a "developer" list if you would like 
to join that one to stay up to date with the development of ver 5...

Subject: [Xitami] download speed using Pro 2.4d10 limited
Message-ID: <49C8D935.4040206@rogers.com>

I seem to have hit an impasse with the download speed being limited to 
~140kb/sec when downloading a file via HTTP.  I know it's not the line 
as (a) it's a local network and (b) I can FTP at over 600kb/sec.

I notice there is a PIPE option but all I can find would seem to 
indicate v2.5 or higher.  I need SSL so I have to stay with v2.4, 
although turning this on or off makes no difference.

Any thoughts?

Peter
