Hi,  
I am using vista 32 bit  o/s linux machine died, need windows machine when I try
to build under 32 vista it say can find MSVCDIR even though I set it both
command line and though window interface.
 
under virtual pc running xp, I build foreign great, but it dies on base
c is not recognized as internal or extern command"
C-q "filename?" failed stop.
 
should I even be building this products or should be writting a BOOM script to 
create the lastest files because with OPENAMQ everything builds fine

I have OCD I am not good at failing. I just keep on trying and trying.
 
Sorry for the inconvience I know they are legacy Products but I think I need 
them to use MOP Correct?
 
Jim

Subject: [Xitami] Can't get Directory Listings to work
Message-ID: <7af044e10911201339n6c013782xceaa53dfe15df83a@mail.gmail.com>

I can't get Xitami X5 to list directories on an XP SP3 machine.  I have
created a .httpdir file in the directories beneath the root that I want to
be listed.  I've restarted Xitami, rebooted etc but can't get rid of
the: You are not authorised to access this resource. Not allowed to list
contents of directory

I've been using Xitami since the mid 90's and am not a newbie but this is my
first X5 install.  Any help is appreciated.
