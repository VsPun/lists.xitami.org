<PRE>
cgi-bin is a acronym for &quot;Common GateWay Binary&quot; directory. You can place any
executable in the directory and run it as long as the executable takes it's
input from stdin and environment variables and sends it's output to stdout. That
is you can write your own cgi exe's as long as you adhere to the published CGI
protocol.

Deplhi and C++Builder are good examples of development environments that are
delivered with the necessary components to create CGI binaries, many people use
third party libraries to write vb programs for cgi.

Perl and php are most commonly used because they transparently handle the CGI
protocol for you. However, if perl or php are used then the perl binary (it's
large) or php.exe have to be launched in order to interpret / compile the
script. Sometimes a small stand alone exe can perform far better under load.
It's a matter of trading convenience / performance.

For REALLY GOOD performance an LRWP is the answer with Xitami.

I have not seen anything run in the cgi-bin directory that wasn't a cgi or
perl script, of course I haven't seen a lot. I guess you could run about any
exe file there. I haven't played around enough with vb scripts or some of
the other scripts to know if that is what they use but I think they call it
CGI-bin for a reason. So if someone knows what other things you can run in
there let me know, I might like to experiment a bit.

A lot of cgi scripts will run by changing them from .cgi to .pl, and Xitami
seems to run them with less tweaking then MS IIS.

Paul - You must know something that I don't. I had to install perl 5 to get
any of my cgi or perl scripts to run. And I believe it stated so in the
Xitami instructions. So what am I missing?

Anyway we need to ask &quot;what are you trying to do&quot;.

Hi people,

It would be nice to know what the cgi is written in, but assuming its perl
and it works in dos that would indicate that perl was installed.
