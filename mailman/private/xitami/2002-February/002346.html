<PRE>I have not seen anything run in the cgi-bin directory that wasn't a cgi or
perl script, of course I haven't seen a lot. I guess you could run about any
exe file there. I haven't played around enough with vb scripts or some of
the other scripts to know if that is what they use but I think they call it
CGI-bin for a reason. So if someone knows what other things you can run in
there let me know, I might like to experiment a bit.

A lot of cgi scripts will run by changing them from .cgi to .pl, and Xitami
seems to run them with less tweaking then MS IIS.

Paul - You must know something that I don't. I had to install perl 5 to get
any of my cgi or perl scripts to run. And I believe it stated so in the
Xitami instructions. So what am I missing?

Anyway we need to ask &quot;what are you trying to do&quot;.

Hi people,

It would be nice to know what the cgi is written in, but assuming its perl
and it works in dos that would indicate that perl was installed.
