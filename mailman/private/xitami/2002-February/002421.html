<PRE>However, I'd like to see it do that trick when I post mail from my
account at work, on an entirely different computer in an entirely
different domain.  (With the only commonality being the .uk on the ends
of both addresses.)

Use a webmail interface to access your e-mail remotely. If your ISP
doesn't have it tell them to get it.  If they don't then use
mail.yahoo.com to check your other pop accounts through yahoo. The
downside is in order for you to check your pop e-mail through yahoo you
have to actually agree to get some spam from them on your yahoo account.
Personally I let all the list e-mail wait till I get back to the office.
I just check my personal e-mail remotely.

Agreed; or to be more exact in my responses to those three assertions:

Yes, It's moot (although it's not how things used to be), and Indeed

&gt;<i> For people with multiple addresses,  in outlook anyway  (groans in the
</I>&gt;<i> background)   When I reply to this post,  it automatically uses the
</I>same
&gt;<i> e-mail account for which the e-mail was addressed to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="mailto:bob@bob.com">bob@bob.com</A> subscribes to list. When he replies his computer 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically picks <A HREF="mailto:bob@bob.com">bob@bob.com</A> and not <A HREF="mailto:bobswife@bob.com">bobswife@bob.com</A> Which is 
</I>&gt;<i> another account in outlook.
</I>
Which is very astute of Outlook; finally something I can commend.

However, I'd like to see it do that trick when I post mail from my
account at work, on an entirely different computer in an entirely
different domain.  (With the only commonality being the .uk on the ends
of both addresses.)
