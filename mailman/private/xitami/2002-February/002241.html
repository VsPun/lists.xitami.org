<PRE>Hello to everyone.

I have had Xitami 2.5b5 running for over a year now and first I must say it
has been a joy to use. Actually all I had to do was install it, made some
html and after that, just forget about it. No need to check every day if my
pages were alive. They truly have been. Including FTP.

I have registered two domain names at mydomain.com. They are ???.net and the
other one is ???andwhatnot.com. I have ADSL connection with static IP. So my
both domains point to same IP-address. Is it possible to make Xitami to
separate these domain names and guide the visitors to sites (in this case
two different folders on same HD) they are looking for or do I have to set
up a DNS-server or something else? I've tried to use virtual hosts but I
just couldn't make it work. Maybe I haven't just got it right...

 So, in short. Two domain names pointing to same IP and in Xitami I have two
different folders for two different domains. How can I make this work?


Best regards
