<PRE>Ya know, watching the threads that are running here, leaves me shaking my
head.

List operators have the ability to obtain an agreement from those who would
join and take a responsible direction toward educating their users, in
support of the product base their working to expand.  This, as opposed to
open or direct dialog which serves to show their public flames, brow beating
and criticizm, from those who moderate the service and supposedly are there
to propel the product's growth and help the users.

A service can easily automate moderation criteria and react with warnings,
education and even soft or hard ban's on users who fail to comply, without
ever taxing the moderation group, other than to establish it initially.
Even teenagers have been able to handle the concept in ICQ and other public
forums.

If the list group were to sponser a venue for users to have online
interaction, they could provide a forum for off-topic dialog which could
work to Xitami's benefit, strengthening their shareware base and evolving
into commercial sales.  As well, the technology could be an implementation
to Xitami, further touting it's already robust package.

I've been tempted to introduce the product into my customer base, because of
the ease of use and bredth of capability, however the exposure I continue to
see here, tells me those opportunities will have to wait awhile.  I'm sure
someone would gladly tell me &quot;If you spend the money for a registration,
you'll get quality support.&quot;  I'm not conviced by what I'm seeing here and
those of us in sales understand it reflects on the corporate mentality as a
whole.  As well, we in shareware work hard, are patient and at times take
risks to help others develop a good product.  Consider these things
gentlemen, even if mid-scale integration is your bread and butter, this
server product has a strong potential, worth the professionalism of you who
develop it and those who apply it.  Your competition is probably having a
field day showing this list to customers.

If I'm over quota, would someone dig this out of the technical consultant's
bit bucket? {:-(

I'll get off my soap box now, thank you for your time.
Mike Wilson
