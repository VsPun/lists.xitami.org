<PRE>Hello...

<A HREF="http://test.modernwonder.com">http://test.modernwonder.com</A>  &amp; www.modernwonder.com are two different
servers one in in Oregon and the other in in Kansas. The company I
register my domain offers free dns so I donts need to us dnstogo  but I
may try it. The company I have my domain name registered through
operates the DNS server, so any changes I make as in the addition of an
alias or the location of the main web are reflected instantly. In the
case of modernwonder.com I have that set for url forwarding to another
domain. This is for my father in law.  Test is my server for devlopement
purposes. I host everything of mine on a cold fusion server. I really
want ot get into Cold fusion so I rent space out of a server in Kasas&gt; I
host a few sites on there already. I have about 4-6 Gb worth of
transfers per month.  This seemed to be the most ecconomical way to do
it right now.

Again when I changed the portbase it was reflected in the control panel
and I was only able to connect using the port number I specified so I
know the cfg is correct.

Www is not needed on any domain.  Most ISP set up the dns or the
webserver to default to www. This is called a domain alias.

Talked to ATT today.  I am also having troubles sending files via icq
too. They claim to only filter ports: 137, 138, 139, 520 and 1080.
Wonder why... I have tried other port numbers like 6080 and higher ones
as well. Still no effect.

As for my posts that I get back form the list, all say Plain Text at the
top.  I will send the e-mail to you with a screenshot.  I hope that this
will end that discussion.

Thanks

MessageHello Many Lists,

&gt;<i> I have the exact same setup as you but it wont work for me.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://test.modernwonder.com/">http://test.modernwonder.com/</A>   If I type the name in it comes up for
</I>me,
&gt;<i> but it does not for my wife at work. Could you please check it?
</I>
I was not able to connect to <A HREF="http://test.modernwonder.com">http://test.modernwonder.com</A>  but, I was
able to connect to www.modernwonder.com .

Personally, I have never tried to use subdomains in this setup yet,
although I will soon.  But, there are a few points to look at here
regardless.  So . . .

A) if you are using dns2go to port forward for you, notice that it only
forwards web requests with the www prefix.  So the URL
<A HREF="http://test.modernwonder.com">http://test.modernwonder.com</A> will not port forward.  Dns2go will instead
try to send it to your ip on port 80 regardles of what you have it set
to in the client.

B) when someone tries to connect to you from near within the Road Runner
network, dns2go forwards them directly to your IP, so actually they end
up contacting you from within the Road Runner network and may not
encounter a port 80 block on their way.  We are probably far enough
apart that I still encounter a port 80 block on my way to you - so i do
not see your site.

C) when you use vhosting on xitami, you get a separate defaults.cfg file
for each one.  If this one is set to a portbase of 0, it is listening on
port 80 anyway.  If it has a higher portbase, you probably wouldn't be
able to connect to it because dns2go is not forwarding since there is no
www prefix.

Here's what I would try:
1) Change your vhost to www.test.modernwonder.com
2) Check the defaults.cfg in the folder that xitami creates.  Make sure
to set the portbase to 6000 or 8000 or whatever it is that works for
www.modernwonder.com .
3) go ahead and register www.test.modernwonder.com at dns2go in the
multi-domain manager section of the site, and make sure it is &quot;grouped&quot;
with www.modernwonder.com .  I'm not sure if the www is required, but
you should at least register test.modernwonder.com.
4) wait about a day for things to sort themselves out . . .

Hopefully that helps, if not, let me know and I will play around some
here.

P.S. Thanks for the global outlook reply setting, Jeff Hamblin.  And
sorry Many Lists, but it seems you are still sending in html.
