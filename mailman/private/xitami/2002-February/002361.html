&gt;<i> Can any one help me with this problem???

I know that I cannot; however, I'd be surprised if ANYONE can, since the
way you've posted your question leaves huge ambiguities about what,
exactly, your problem might be.

The main ambiguity, as I see it, is that there are a number of posts
there: some with sensible trimming out of original material, and salient
follow-up questions being asked, and atop of all this, various comments
by &quot;top-posters&quot; who have made no apparent attempt to make it clear just
to which point (if any) they are responding.  Therefore one is left to
guess as to exactly what it was that they were attempting to amplify:
there's lots of untrimmed quote below, and one would need to be a
mind-reader to understand just which bit it was that they had read and to
which they had responded.

Ditto with your post: just which bit (if any) of that farrago was &quot;your
problem&quot;?

What is so difficult in &lt;<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html">http://www.geocities.com/nnqweb/nquote.html</A>&gt;
that people persist in TOFU-posting, to the detriment of clarity?

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
