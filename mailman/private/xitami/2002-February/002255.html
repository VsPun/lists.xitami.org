<PRE>I did setup the machine containing the web server for manual TCP/IP (static)
192.168.1.2 and included the cable DNS's, and domain name. No help there.

I see in the router the area for mac address ghosting, and with a
ipconfig/all in cmd window the mac address or the cable modem is revealed.
Is this what I put into the router and is that called mac ghost overlay?

I'll promptly stop DMZ as you suggest and continue to forward 21, 80 and 81
to 192.168.1.2. Is this correct?

If I browse the www.myurl.com from my network, it works fine, but not from
the internet. So perhaps the mac address ghosting is the critical element
here.

&gt;<i> On my server machine, I had to set my TCP/IP address, host name, domain,
</I>dns
&gt;<i> primary, secondary and DHCP manually. ( the linksys acquire will usually
</I>be
&gt;<i> dynamic however) (ADSL)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For one cable client using linksys, we had to follow the linksys help file
</I>&gt;<i> for mac address ghosting, which requires a trip to the dos prompt,
</I>(assuming
&gt;<i> windows), and generate the mac ghost overlay, then input it to linksys.
</I>&gt;<i> (motorola cable-modem).  Using the labled mac address from the modem did
</I>no
&gt;<i> good here. (we could ping but not surf.) This fixed it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also forwarded all the noted addresses in the linksys forward page, then
</I>&gt;<i> closed up those not needed, as I could disprove them. (make sure your
</I>&gt;<i> pointing to the manually configured server ip address for forwarding).
</I>DMZ
&gt;<i> was not neccessary nor is it advisable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you force a network browser to a full www url, pointing to your page,
</I>do
&gt;<i> you get out and back in from your own request generation, (that is
</I>&gt;<i> www.mypage.whatever as opposed to using the network nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
</I>address?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe do some port scanning from a third party on the net and see what
</I>&gt;<i> status is showing up on various ports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck.

</I>&gt;<i> Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from
</I>dialup,
&gt;<i> using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get to my FTP,
</I>&gt;<i> but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network. Must be the
</I>&gt;<i> router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as well as added
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.
