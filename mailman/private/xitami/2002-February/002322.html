<PRE>I meant I was running the same cfg file.  I did edit directly.  What
made you believe I didn't?  My ip is dynamic but the DHCP server never
gives you an IP address so I suppose it is based off the mac address I
gave them. Then again I never gave them the mac for my laptop which I
connect directly to the net sometimes. At Home/Att/Comcast is just plain
Nuts...

Hello Many Lists,

I'm sorry, but I thought you said:

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have the exact same setup as you but it wont work for me.
</I>
1) You are not using Road Runner - you are using AT&amp;T
2) You are not using dns2go, you are using some other name server
3) You are using a subdomain of a domain that is hosted in another state
- I have a single domain
4) Doesn't sound like your ip is dynamic, although it is not clear at
this point
5) You are using the xitami html interface,  while I am editing the
config files directly

The suggestions I gave in my last post was specific to my setup.  And,
yes, www is required in order to use port forwarding in dns2go.  I know
it is not required in general, but it is what the dns2go sever program
specifically looks for in order to know what to port forward and not
port forward.  In other words dns2go will not port forward
<A HREF="http://mydomain.com">http://mydomain.com</A>  , but it will port forward <A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com">http://www.mydomain.com</A>
.  It all ends up at the same ip, but only the one with the www prefix
gets port forwarded by dns2go (in other words its specific to dns2go).

I'm sorry but your setup is very different than mine.  From your
responses, it seems that your provider may well be at fault.  My guess
is Xitami is working fine - as it is serving out web pages to those who
can get to it. Hopefully with enough experimentation, you'll find a port
that everyone can get through on.

And, I'm not trying to get on your case, cause I don't even care cause
I'm on high-speed and got drive space for weeks, but your original
response to my post that I received at 3:48 PM was in html - not the one
you sent the screen shot of.
