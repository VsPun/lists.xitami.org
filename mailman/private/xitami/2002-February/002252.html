<PRE>On my server machine, I had to set my TCP/IP address, host name, domain, dns
primary, secondary and DHCP manually. ( the linksys acquire will usually be
dynamic however) (ADSL)

For one cable client using linksys, we had to follow the linksys help file
for mac address ghosting, which requires a trip to the dos prompt, (assuming
windows), and generate the mac ghost overlay, then input it to linksys.
(motorola cable-modem).  Using the labled mac address from the modem did no
good here. (we could ping but not surf.) This fixed it.

I also forwarded all the noted addresses in the linksys forward page, then
closed up those not needed, as I could disprove them. (make sure your
pointing to the manually configured server ip address for forwarding).  DMZ
was not neccessary nor is it advisable.

If you force a network browser to a full www url, pointing to your page, do
you get out and back in from your own request generation, (that is
www.mypage.whatever as opposed to using the network nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn address?

Maybe do some port scanning from a third party on the net and see what
status is showing up on various ports.

Good luck.
Mike


Anybody have this sort of trouble before? After going to cable from dialup,
using a Linksys router, folks coming in on the internet can get to my FTP,
but not my HTTP.  I can get to my HTTP on the local network. Must be the
router. Have set the IP the Xitami server is on to DMZ, as well as added
forwarding for this IP for ports 21, 80 and 81. No go.
