<PRE>Gentlemen,

I have gone through the configs pages, the vhost pages, the faq, xitami
archives and global net searches, as well as debug reporting, trying to get
the limited /setup vhwba to access a test vhost and have failed with every
attempt now for days.  Does this function even  work?

I'm running 2.5b4, DSL pppoe, through a lynksys router through IE5.5 with
http/1.1 enabled.
This is a dynamic IP.  DNS is functioning and I update the dns reflection
through a ddns client.  The translation to the server for typical HTTP and
FTP access has worked fine, with ftp directed explicitly to the site sub
directory, below webpages.

For this mail, I refer to a fictitious address being
<A HREF="http://www.hysted.mine.nu">http://www.hysted.mine.nu</A> as my host url.

During vhost wizard creation, I have allowed the default dns to be acquired
for the &quot;Or, enter DNS host name&quot; field with the profile hostname as
&quot;vhost1&quot; .cfg

Webpage root directory was explicit from drive root, using forward slash
method to /vhost1
FTP was set explicit from drive root, using forward slash method to /vhost1

VH WBA is checked to indicate use of the limited WBA

And user id as &quot;vh1user&quot; and password as &quot;vh1pass&quot;

The &quot;create&quot; was confirmed and the server restarted, just to be sure.

In the resultant profile under vhost, security, passwords, I select the
/setup protected uri and instead of &quot;vh1user&quot; and &quot;vh1pass&quot;, I have &quot;admin&quot;
and &quot;-&quot;.  So I figure this is to avoid &quot;defaults&quot; in administration
profiles.


I convert the user from &quot;admin&quot; to &quot;vh1user&quot; and the password from &quot;-&quot; to
&quot;vh1pass&quot;
I exit through consecutive &quot;saves&quot;, restart the server, and check the cfg
and aut files next, they follow here:


vhost1.cfg
-----------------------
#*END

[Accesslog]
    Filename = &quot;vhost1.log&quot;

[Ftp]
    Root = &quot;c:/program files/xitami/webpages/vhost1&quot;

[Security]
    Filename = &quot;vhost1.aut&quot;

[Server]
    Webpages = &quot;c:/program files/xitami/webpages/vhost1&quot;

[Wsx]
    Admin = &quot;&quot;
____________________________


vhost1.aut
----------
#*END

[/admin]
    Admin = &quot;-&quot;

[/setup]
    Vh1user = &quot;vh1pass&quot;
______________________________

As far as I can see, I should be able to hit this vhost from the browser in
the /setup realm using

<A HREF="http://www.vh1user@vhost1.hysted.mine.nu/setup">http://www.vh1user@vhost1.hysted.mine.nu/setup</A>

I expect to see an authentication show up under &quot;/setup&quot; realm where
&quot;vh1user&quot; and &quot;vh1pass&quot; will enable the limited VH WBA.

I get back IE5's 404 page cannot be found

I try to hit <A HREF="http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/">http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/</A> and I get the /vhost1/
directory...no problem

I try <A HREF="http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/setup">http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/setup</A> and I get the IE5 404 cannot
be found again.

I setup the server to log debug files, empty the log files and repeat the
call to <A HREF="http://www.vh1user@vhost1.hysted.mine.nu/setup">http://www.vh1user@vhost1.hysted.mine.nu/setup</A>
I cycle the logs immediately and check the debug files:

/debug/header.log

_________________________________________________

The error and access logs show the same basically.  The post is present,
then the failed get.

Oddly, when I hit the same url with <A HREF="http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/admin,">http://www.hysted.mine.nu./vhost1/admin,</A>
It hits the &quot;admin&quot; realm and awaits authentication, which is disabled of
course.

Can anybody help with this?  I've been trying for over a week with other
various configurations and I'm getting exasperated.

Thank you in advance.
Mike
