This is probably true.  (And I like newsgroups much more than I like web
&quot;message boards&quot;, and to some extent more than I like mailing lists.)

&gt;<i>Perhaps a case could be made for restructuring the 
</I>&gt;<i>comp.infosystems.www.servers.* hierarchy [....]
</I>&gt;<i>Would anyone care to try raising an RFD?
</I>
If anyone wants to follow this through (start the RFD process for a new
newsgroup), then I'm happy to provide some support (eg, statistics on
number of users of the mailing list, etc).  However I don't have time to
do it myself.

Anyone keen to see about establishing a newsgroup?  (Possibly even an
alt.* newsgroup would do.)

&gt;<i>(OTOH, Imatix could run an NNTP server on their systems, that handles
</I>&gt;<i>only a xitami newsgroup, or hierarchy of them.  
</I>
This is generally the worst-of-all-worlds.  The major advantage of
newsgroups is that they're well distributed.  And if there's just one
newsserver carrying the newsgroup, then everyone has to adjust their
newsservers to read from that one.  It's basically a web &quot;message board&quot;
with different software.
