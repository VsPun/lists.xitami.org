<PRE>Trust me this is not a lot of posts for an e-mail discussion group!   I
get over 300+ a day in www.isp-wireless.com along! As for newsgroups it
seems for the most part that us techies are the only ones that use them.
Less ISP's (from what I read on the isp lists) are supporting them due
to the fact that people don't use them much like the free webspace they
get.  The following was a post on the list.

&quot;I run a small ISP here in Oklahoma, we offer it because with our Linux
server once we place them on our server they automatically get a home
page. I have only had 3 people use it out of 400 users...&quot;

So ISP's are either outsourcing because not as many people request them
or use them along with shell accounts, webpage space and newsgroups.
Form the Isp standpoint Newsgroups take a lot of resources. Money,
hundreds of gigs worth of space...

toodles
