Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and PHP
Message-ID: <4369619F.6050007@earthlink.net>

I run a simple little website and I want to grab the referer and store that in a database.  Everything I've programmed has worked (I've been in databases for 20 years, I am relatively new to PHP however).  Anyway, someone links to my site from a page with a url like:

http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/21/1946254

I see that exact URL in my web log as the referrer.  If, I check the HTTP_REFERER in PHP, it always shows as

http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl 

Everything past the ? is stripped.  In javascript, document.referrer is the comlpete URL. So, the browser appears to have access to the complete URL, the web server does too, but for some reason PHP does not.  Leads me to believe it's a config error, but I'll be darned if I can find it.  Any ideas?

I have used PHPBB etc in the past with no problems.  I am not sure if this problem is in PHP or Xitami, but I thought I'd ask here.

It's a Xitami 2.4d9, Win2K, PHP 4.3.1 if I recall correctly.

Any help is appreciated.

Hi members,

does anyone have experince with a bulletin board/forum and xitami ?
In particular phpBB.if there is something others out, he let me know as
well. I am trying to get this installed, but have no luck since 2 days so
far. Don't know where to look anymore.
Other php pages are displaying properly, but I can't get the installation
going. I get only the 404 error.

Any help would be appreciated.

Does Xitami have a feature or plug-in similar to mod_rewrite in Apache?

Generally, running the php setup .exe should configure Xitami 
automagically.

> Is there extra software needed?

No. If the setup program doesn't work, try adding these lines under 
the indicated headers to your Xitami defaults.cfg file:


[Filter]
    .php=D:\\php\\php.exe

[Server]
    Default1=index.php


(replace with your path, and you may want the index.php to have 
another name or be Default2 or so -- naturally, the number indicates 
the order in which the server is looking for default documents)

I couldn't get php running with back slashes, single or double.
For me to get it working, I had to use forward slashes, like
    .php=D:/php/php.exe
 Xitami 2.5c2 php 4.3.11

I was stuck for  a few days and found this info by chance as a comment
on one of the php help sites.

Maybe a 2.5 bug / undocumented change? I run 2.4...

Message-ID: <437DA168.5070304@gmx.net>

Hi.

Using aliases (alias-target on different drive than xitami),

$_POST, $_GET, $_REQUEST globals stay empty.

If I put the same file into Xitami's webpages directory, it works.

I tried with PHP4 and PHP 5.0.4, 5.0.5.

(The only workaround for me up to now are NTFS junctions.)

Thanks for any help, regards,

Reg,

few megabytes file, it stops after some 150kbs.

Any idea anyone?

He Maurilio,

I just tried it and didn't had a problem here. Had this in the past too, but just started a 
second time and over wrote the first try with that 150kb and it was proper.
Will sent you off list the file.

I had the same problem and i could never solve it.
So i decided to use quick&easy ftp server, that is free.
Not a great server but it's enough for what i need. But i'm still interested
in knowing how to solve this problem.

Johannes,

thanks so much, there must have been a misunderstanding.

I'm not saying I cannot download xitami package, but that, users cannot download files from my
website.

regards.

I recall having many Xitami FTP server problems several years ago and after
seeking help the basic response I always got was that Xitami FTP was very
buggy, that they weren't certain if they were ever going to make Xitami FTP
fixes a priority and not to rely on it for production services.  I took
their advice and sought other FTP server solutions.  Over the years I have
seen many, many people inquire about the same problems I experienced and I
don't ever recall anyone ever being satisfied with it.  It's best you find
another FTP solution and leave Xitami as standalone web server.

The web server seems to work great, however, recently I discovered a bug, or
flaw, in it's design:

The CGI engine buffers files being uploaded via http and prevents other
mechanisms from controlling the upload STDIN buffer.  I wrote a perl script
to by-pass the CGI buffering process so I could provide my users with an
accurate upload progress meter.  The basic concept is to grab the total size
of the upload prior to the upload occurring, then read in the STDIN buffer
and make comparrisons to how much has been read in versus the known over all
size of the upload.  Through each comparrison increment a progress meter
that is in a pop up window.

It took me weeks to figure out what was wrong with it until I installed
Apache on my server and my scripts worked perfectly on the first try.
Xitami's CGI engine doesn't release any buffer information until all of the
file(s) have been loaded into the servers memory - then it allows those
file(s) to be processed, error checked and written to the hard drive.  In
order for my script to work properly it needs to grab information before the
upload starts, but Xitami is somehow preventing that.

Hello: What I was saying before is that I cannot download the Xitami 
packages from THEIR own server which I imagine uses their own FTP, meaning 
that the Xitami FTP is buggy and they haven't even fixed it for use on 
their own site. So its no wonder your users cannot use it on your site.
It always downloads a small portion of the file and ends.

okay, sorry for the misunderstanding. I had the same "buggy" experience myself with 
the ftp server. Even sometimes updating my sites with a few files was a bit of a pain.
I switch to FileZilla Server after long searching and I love it, 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla.
Easy to configure.

Hope that helps.

Hmmm, the Xitami packages on xitami.com are downloaded via HTTP not
FTP, and the downloads should work just fine.

The Xitami FTP server is buggy, yes. Bad code, written by a sloppy
programmer, and we've never had the time to fix it.  We have said some
time ago that for production FTP usage, you will be wise to use a real
FTP server.  Xitami's FTP is useful mainly for uploading files to web
sites, and it works fine for this.

For users having trouble downloading responses from Xitami, you should
check whether you're using the last version.  There were some bugs in
the past that caused CGI output to be truncated in some cases.

I'm sorry not to be able to provide better news, such as updates and
fixes.  Xitami has been frozen for some time.  We keep the web site
and these lists up, and we make security patches, but the
functionality is on ice until someone gives us or we find the money to
make a new version.

Cheers,

Yes, latest code, the problem seems to be bound to client speed, I mean, the
same file can be downloaded without problems by clients coming from a fast
connection (ADSL or more) but gets truncated if the client is coming from a
dial-up, 56k modem, connection.

Really sad.
