Subject: [Xitami] gzipping html on the fly?
Message-ID: <6.0.0.14.0.20040404103314.027caa70@mail.verfaillie.com>

Hello !

Is it possible to gzip html pages on the fly?
I already do this for dynamic content: whenever the server receives a 
"HTTP-ACCEPT-ENCODING: gzip, i send the response gzipped (for large 
documents, the size is reduced to 20% of the original size!).

I don't want to keep a html and gz version of any page, since pages on the 
server are regularly updated by users.

Thanks,


Marc

Hello Listmembers,

I'm new to xitami and this list thince end of march. I got 3 post's so far, but no reply to those questions.
Are the replys not posted on the list ? 
I'm member of the Mercury MTA list and on that list the replys are posted and, in my view, that's the best 
benefit.

For some light regards the replys I would be happy.

Johannes

Yes, replys are usually posted to the board and you should get them in your

I didn't had any question. I was just wondering that 2 post's , from Elliot March 26 and from Ashish March 30 
didn't got any reply. It looked that quite to me, that I had to shout: " Hello is somebody out there ?" :-)

I just had installed Xitami 2.5b1 and so far no questions for a newbie regards webserver. If I will have 
some, I hope this list can help me to fix my problems or to point me in the correct direction.

Hi Johannes

I have been trying to get an answer to my question for over a month.  I
guess there are no answers out there for my problem or no one wants to take
a shot at it.

Maybe I will try a third time...  See if it works!

I have been using Xitami v2.5b4 for a good while now.  I have always had the
log format set to CLSF (NCSA) which is the one I need for my log reader.
About 2 weeks ago, it just stopped logging in CLSF and is now logging the
short version, NCSA common.  I am now loosing a lot of data that I like to
get.  I haven't changed the log type or anything else for that matter.

Does anyone know what may have happened and how I can fix this problem?

Sorry, I can't help you , I have xitami 2.5b4 installed 2 weeks ago on my old spare machine to see what it 
looks like. It's not running yet; I'm still working on the website. But I know for sure I will use it because 
of it's flexibility for different OS systems. What I most liked, it can run even on a small 16 bit Windows 
system.
 At the testing time I used notepad as log reader. What kind of reader do you use and the next question is, 
what kind of "more" information can you get with the log reader you are using.

Xitami is the best all around web server.  I've been running it now for a
year and it beats the h*** out of the Apache I was using.  I wouldn't have
anything else.

>  At the testing time I used notepad as log reader. What kind of reader do

Notepad.  It's as good as anything.

>and the next question is,
> what kind of "more" information can you get with the log reader you are

>
It's not really the log reader... You just set the type of log format you
want in the Xitami default.cfg.  [Accesslog]
Format= "CLFX"
This is the same as the generic NCSA.  This gives you the long form which
includes bots/spiders, search words used, search phrases, browser type,
sites connected from, operating systems, plus all that the short log form
gives.  Then you can read it with whatever log reader you wish.  I use
awstats.pl .

For me this has worked for many months, but now my Xitami server has stopped
giving the long form even though it is set for CLFX and I have not changed
anything that I know of.

This is my dilemma...

I don't have my machine running here, but is there maybe a fixed logsize setting anywhere  or is the log able 
to overwrite the given sizes, if it exists ?
Sorry, it's maybe not a big help.

Hi,

Note: I'm sending this again and this time sending from the acount I
subscribed to the list to.

I'm trying to enable Python to get xitami to call viewcvs.cgi.  If I rename
it to viewcvs.py and add a filter (.py=D:\Python23\python.exe #pass *.py to
python). It works, but how do I tell it to look at the first line of
viewcvs.cgi and get it to call python from it). (Like it does on Linux)

Thanks,
Brian

Windows != Linux

The calling mechanisms are not the same.

Put simply, you add a filter for .cgi that hands it off to python.

Hey people,

  I don't know what is going on here, hopefully you guys can help.  I 
have xitami setup to rename the log files to the date once a day at 
midnight.  For whatever reason, it is not doing this.  Sometimes it will 
be going along and be logging the way it is suppose to and then one day, 
it doesn't change the log file name.  I looked around in the logs and in 
the log file that is setup to do console/system log file, I saw a bunch 
of errors as follows:

Could not rename '<insert file location here>' to '<insert file location 
here>'
Permission denied

But I don't know why it says permission denied.  It could do it before, 
why not now?

Thanks for any help,
Dan

yes - i get that every so often. if you try to open the log file for viewing
you get an error also. i use this as a good time to purge old log files (i
do daily files). delete all your old files. shut down xitami so you can
rename the current file to something else. restart xitami.

that usually works for a while again ;-)

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami and PHP
Message-ID: <opr6l1wm1m0qks7s@mail.nycap.rr.com>

I'm running Xitami with the latest version of PHP.  Everything about PHP 
seems to work just fine, except that I can't connect to any other TCP 
address.  Particularly, the mail() function doesn't work.  I get an error 
telling me that I can't connect to "localhost" on port 25.  It seems that 
no connections at all are possible.  Using other PHP commands that make 
FTP connections, etc. I get the same error, unable to connect to (IP 
Address) on (port #).

Here's the strange thing:  If I run the same PHP scripts from the PHP 
command line, they work just fine.  The only time they don't work is when 
I try to run them by visiting them with Xitami.

I have the following two entries in my Xitami.cfg:

[Mime]
    php=application/x-httpd-php

[Filter]
.php=C:\web\PHP\php.exe


I like Xitami a lot, and I don't want to switch servers.  I'm not sure how 
to get this to work....

Thanks in advance
Michael

The script is expecting you to be running your own SMTP mail server on
your localhost.

If you believe that you are running such a server, can you connect to it
"manually" (i.e. by typing "telnet localhost 25" into a command-prompt
window)?

Has anyone else seen this sort of stupidity when they post articles to
the list?  Quite frankly, I'm not going to play games with idiots who
so badly/sadly misconfigure their anti-spam measures that a post through
a mailing list becomes a false positive.  Especially, I'm not going to
visit a web-site which might just be a mechanism for harvesting known-
to-be-working e-mail addresses, perhaps even without the knowledge of
this mailing list subscriber.

If others have had such nonsensical "rejections" then perhaps the list
owner needs to have a quiet little word in the earhole of Erv.

The problem is not the anti-spam, but the spam.
We also have an anti-spam engine, and i am thinking of implementing this 
sort of measure.
Our server (small company) receives thousands of spam messages a day, and 
this challenge-response is the only way left to reject spam. Most spammers 
know by now how to circumvent Baesian filtering.
But sometimes maintaining the anti-spam engine is more work than deleting 
each spam message.

Don't blame it on the postmaster ...

Message-ID: <001701c42568$aa5f8630$1e02a8c0@midnight>

When I try to restart Xitami from the GUI, it stops the server but does not
restart it.  I should say that 9 out 10 times it doesn't restart.  I have to
go to the server closet and restart it manually.

Anyone have an idea how I can fix this?  I would like to be able to restart
from the remote computers.

Thanks

Do you mean using the web interface?
I never had problem restarting the server using the web interface.
Look at the logs to see what prevents the server from restarting. Maybe 
another service is trying to access port 21/80?
I don't know what OS you are using, so i can't help you much more.

I use a feature in National Instruments LabVIEW called Remote Panel.
To publish these Remote Panels I have to run the National Instruments

Unfortunately this Webserver has no possibilities for user/password

How can I use Xitami as a first Webserver for authentification and get

If we can figure out which email address "Erv Kosch" is subscribed with,
then I'll remove it from the mailing list (alas, I can't find either of
the domains messages in the challenge message, nor "Erv" or "Kosch" in
the subscriber list).

It is not reasonable to expect either the mailing list software, or
every list subscriber, to respond to your challenge software for
messages posted to a mailing list that you chose to subscribe to.  So my
policy is to treat them like any other bounce message -- that more than
one or two indicates the address is broken and should be removed from
the mailing list.

After determining that si20.com is the domain for the software, and
solidblue.biz is the domain for the company producing the software, I
emailed support@si20.com, who have told me the email address for "Erv
Kosch".

I've marked that email address "no mail" on the mailing list, which
should stop these annoying challenge messages; if they resume then I'll
ban the address permanently.

People enrolled on mailing lists should ensure that all traffic from the
list is acceptable, and not require that individual subscribers pass the
response token.  Otherwise, they have no right to be on the list.

There is NO technical solution to spam; it requires a political fix.

Hmm, this makes me more suspicious that perhaps the challenge-response
was ungenuine, and that it was some new address harvester instead.

Thank you; that is an extremely practical (and pragmatic) attitude.

There are many different spam stopping software's on the market and several
that request you return a coded reply so that your email is accepted but
more than likely he is able to put in accepted domains so that they
shouldn't happen. I used one for a bit but not on this account and have
since started using something else. Unfortunately with the amount of spam
the flows on the internet people are starting to take desperate actions in
order to stop it. I just returned from being gone for a week and had over
1000 messages with maybe less than 100 actual good messages. The ratio of
email to spam is growing at an alarming rate. So don't come done on folks
trying to get a handle on their email.

No need to reply, I get off my soapbox now.

Has anyone else seen this sort of stupidity when they post articles to
the list?  Quite frankly, I'm not going to play games with idiots who
so badly/sadly misconfigure their anti-spam measures that a post through
a mailing list becomes a false positive.  Especially, I'm not going to
visit a web-site which might just be a mechanism for harvesting known-
to-be-working e-mail addresses, perhaps even without the knowledge of
this mailing list subscriber.

If others have had such nonsensical "rejections" then perhaps the list
owner needs to have a quiet little word in the earhole of Erv.

I would like to suggest your get your email servers to looks a 3rd party for a db of blocked servers.

Last week I turned my email servers to www.spamhaus.org for checking.  I can say my smtp traffic is down by almost 80%.  My clients are very happy with the results.

It's possible, but not a good solution.
Once somebody knows the address+port of the NI webserver, he can bypass Xitami.

Other possibility is to bypass NI web ...
Point the main HTML directory to the directory hosting the files
(configuration/server/main HTML directory in the web admin).
You can use a network path (\\server\sharedDir) if Xitami runs as a normal 
user (=has access to the directory).
If both servers are on the same computer, one of them must listen to an 
alternate port, like 8080.
Check that your router is configured correctly to redirect all access to 
this port to the correct computer -most routers will drop packets to 
unexpected port numbers.
This will of course not work if the pages are dynamic, only if the pages 
are readily available somewhere.
cgi-bin is not possible without tweaking either.

The problem with blacklists is that sometimes legitimate mail servers get
put on the list. For instance I run 12 domains with Xitami on a dynamic dns.
This automatically makes all my domains invalid for sending email to, for
instance, AOL users. I haven't had any other problems lately but have in the
past and just try getting your domain de-listed when you are on a dynamic
IP. It's we, the General Public, that is suffering because of ISP's
unwilling to shut down spammers. What happens when you block emails for your
customers and someone misses an important message. Are you prepared to
suffer the legal ramifications? I'm not, so I will leave it to the customer
to weed thru the spam.

I run the mailserver only for my own company, so I don't have customers to look for and it's on a dynamic IP. 
Regards the behaivior of AOL, I have the same problem, BUT you can deliver your mail to your ISP's server 
which will then relay the message to the receipients address. If you are interested, I can give you more info 
on this. I will do this the off list, because it's not xitami related. Just post your e-mail.
By the way, you mentioned below you have to de-list my domain. Where ? Why ?

Just saying that if your domain gets listed on a blacklist it's real hard to
get it off when you are on a dynamic IP. I'm not sure how to get email to
AOL people. If you have a solution for this I'd like to see it?

If you do get blacklisted the way you get off is enter your IP address.
Since you have a dynamic IP address which changes all the time you can't get
it to work. You can try sending them an email but if your domain is
blacklisted they may not receive it unless you can send it from a
non-blacklisted email server.

What I have understand so far is, that the reason to get blacklisted is because someone is running a 
mailserver as an open relay, or annoys people with his spam and those ones will make a complain to one of the 
organisations who run a blacklist server.
You are asking for a solution to send mail to AOL people. 
Have a look at http://webmail.arcm.com/kbase/whitelist.html
If it's not working, let me know. You will notice that this is for the Mercury/32 MTA, I run this one here 
and it's a great product with a good mailing list.

Regards xitami, I'm just a newbie. I hope to get help if  I need some time.

I regret that the subject line of my original help request became the 
subject line for a spam/anti-spam discussion.  Fortunately, a smart guy by 
the name of Thomas Hruska picked up on my help request, and has helped me 
arrive at a "workaround," and hopefully I'll be able to find a good, 
permanent solution soon.

It has to do with PHP, a web server, and Windows Home Edition.  It's a 
bear of a problem, and I hope you don't run into it.  If you do, seek out 
Tom.

Michael

I'm running WindowsXP Home, the latest Xitami web server, the latest 
stable release of PHP

Hello Michael,

sorry that this subject line became an anti spam discussion. Furthermore, I didn't received/see  any respond 
to your subject from Thomas Hruska. As you and others maybe have seen, I offered Ron help even outside this 
list as I mentioned as well that this topic (mailserver/anti spam) is off topic of xitami. But unfortunatly I 
can't find any "privat" mail address. Is this special to this list ? It makes it so "anonym" that one can't 
contact some else off list for a quick question which would bring no benefits to the listmembers.
I don't want to offend you listmembers, but I think it would bring more "life" in this list and it would 
benefit defenitly all members and especially our good common product; xitami webserver.

If I'm totally out of line with those view's, PLEASE let me know. I'm flexible and can adjust pretty quick.

Yep... (I guess I used the wrong term)

I have always had it.  Been running Xitami for over a year.  If I hit the
<restart> button, usually it stops tha server but wont restart it.  I have
to walk across the house and restart it by hand.

There is nothing in the logs to indicate a problem...
On that server, I only run Xitami.

Thanks Marc or anyone else that can help...

One other question...

Does anyone know why I can't get Xitami to generate CLFX logs?  Even when
set to CLFX it only gives me the short logs... ???

I have a question about LRWP's...

I have been programming them for some time now and love the concept.  But,
I've run into something that I was hoping I could find out a bit more about.

I have tried setting a LRWP client to be a ROOT dir "/"...  It works, but
only sort of.  Sub-pathing is not passed to the LRWP when this is done.

Is this a bug, a half implemented feature, or something of other sorts?

I would like to see it fully implemented.  I would really like to be able to
use LRWP's as ROOT web pages, with sub-pathing.

Anyone else know anything about this?

Thanks!

-Travis

I wasn't asking for help and am not sure I really need it except for maybe
the AOL issue, if you want to email me off list here is my email address
ron@miplanet.net. Also this is another good reason to be on a forum vs a
mailing list. On a forum you can create an off topic thread, but a mailing
list is restricted to only one topic. Another good point of a forum is
organization and searching for answers. Also a good Moderator should keep
the topic relevant and keep everyone in check and on track.

By the way you should be able to get the email address from anyone on the
list by looking at the From: field.

Hello Michael,

sorry that this subject line became an anti spam discussion. Furthermore, I
didn't received/see  any respond
to your subject from Thomas Hruska. As you and others maybe have seen, I
offered Ron help even outside this
list as I mentioned as well that this topic (mailserver/anti spam) is off
topic of xitami. But unfortunatly I
can't find any "privat" mail address. Is this special to this list ? It
makes it so "anonym" that one can't
contact some else off list for a quick question which would bring no
benefits to the listmembers.
I don't want to offend you listmembers, but I think it would bring more
"life" in this list and it would
benefit defenitly all members and especially our good common product; xitami
webserver.

If I'm totally out of line with those view's, PLEASE let me know. I'm
flexible and can adjust pretty quick.

Hello,

I was hoping someone could help me with my problem.
I'm trying to get Xitami to work with AcuCobol cgi.
I've managed to get it work on other webservers but my client wants to =
run the website on Xitami.
The extension of the cgi programs are .acu and the application which has =
to run it is wrun32.exe which I put in de cgi-bin directory with the =
dll's and other files which are needed.
I have to give wrun32 two parameters, which are -f and %s. When I =
include %s it gives an error that %s is not an application. So I dropped =
the %s parameter and then I get an error from wrun32 that the templates =
can't be opened.=20
I've used the filter option to get this to work like this; .acu =3D =
"c:\\xitami\\app\\cgi-bin\\wrun32.exe -f"

Thanks in advance,

Lennart Santifort

Hi all,

For our local intranet i use Xitami as webserver.
My server is a Win2K server. I have active Perl installed.

I want to add a search engine.

On the internet I found Swish-E.
I managed to make an index file.
I'm trying some day's now to get the search working, but i failed.

Is there anyone amongst you who got this combination working.

Please tell me how....

Subject: [Xitami] root
Message-ID: <003101c42965$cc55d770$1e02a8c0@midnight>

Greetings...

I am having the most difficult time setting up a new hierarchy for my web.

I want to get the webpages and FTP, Users etc... out of the Xitami working
directory.  I have followed the setup in the Xitami FTP help pages.  I have
made minor changes to fit my setup and just can't get it to find the pages.
The root just isn't quite right... in one scenario it is "Forbidden"  in
another is can't find anything, in another it just lists the directory, I
have tried just about everything I can think of.  It just doesn't want to
hit the right spot.

I have been running Xitami for a year now with great results, just as long
as I use the default roots.

My setup looks like this:

D:/Web
     |-FTP
           |-Pub
           |-Upload
           |-Guest
     |-User
           |-user1
           |-user2
     |-Private
           |-'virtual domain 1'
           |- etc.

The default.cfg... I have tried the following:
    [Server]
        webpages=D:/Web
                        D:/Web/Private

The Virtual Domains... I have tried the following:
    [Server]
        webpages= Private/www.whatever.com
                        Web/Private/www....
                        D:/Web/Private/www...

I have tried these in all different configurations...

Anyone know what I'm doing wrong?  Please help!

Hello,

I have been a Xitami list subsciber for years.  I have also used the FTP =
portion of Xitami for years.  I know that there are many of you who =
would tell me not to use the FTP portion of Xitami as I see people told =
that all the time.  I have been using it for years without issue under =
98, ME, XP, and Mandrake Linux.  I have received 2 .rar (WinRAR) files =
from a client.  Usually, I get .rar files fine, but both of these are =

Hello,

I'm still using 2.4d9. Once I installed 2.5 and I got a lot of problems,
e.g. couldn't run CGI any more.
That problem you mentioned concerning large pictures did not appear at my
server, but as a reason of all the other problems I uninstalled the 2.5 and
put back 2.4d9.
The 2.5 seems to be some buggy.

Martin

I have the same problem running CGI.
Works fine with 2.4x

Subject: [Xitami] Can not Compile Xitmai on Linux
Message-ID: <200404280740.34012.who@bellsouth.net>

Hello all,

Please fix build.sh so that we can compile Xitmai on Linux...

unless I'm missing something here which I'm sure I am,

cd sfl
sh boomake build install

Where is build? 
I have boomake in each dir but not build..
Where is install?

also cant simply run make from each dir to compile...

'the makefile does exist..'

[r@l gsl]# make
c -q ggcode.c
make: c: Command not found
make: *** [ggcode.o] Error 127

I can take my time to do this right but should everyone?

Then you ought to know better than to dual-post: your message appeared in
both ASCII and also as HTML (the latter is NOT wanted on mailing lists).

OK, you're saying (I think) that your client pushes the file to your
server, using an FTP client of some sort at his end, and using the PUT
command to transfer the file to your local storage, via the services of
the FTP server that's part of Xitami.  Is this correct?

Did your client remember to tell his FTP client program to perform the
transfer in BINARY mode?   A stupid little error, I know, and one that no
experienced user of FTP ought to make, but...

   fix (vb.): 1. to paper over, obscure, hide from public view; 2. to
   work around, in a way that produces unintended consequences that are
   worse than the original problem.  Usage: "Windows ME fixes many of the
   shortcomings of Windows 98 SE".

Subject: [Xitami] Use of Xitami FTP in a Browser.

Hello,

And thanks for your time, help, and advise!

I just set up the FTP portion of Xitami and set the ROUTER to foward to port 21 on the computer that is running Xitami. Then set the Xitami FTP server as active with a restart.
Users and passwords established for the Xitami FTP area all works as expected when the MS DOS command line environment is used to ftp login plus put, get, dir, etc.

Then I tried to use the BROWSER (Windows Internet Explorer 6 with all critical and security upgrades applied). 

The following is keyed to ADDRESS portion of the BROWSER window:

    ftp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URL

The login is performed with the expected displays from the defaults set in the FTP area at Xitami.

I have tried many formats/syntax to get, put, etc. files or even DRAG and DROP to the BROWSER Window for the login directory with no success.

Is this allowed using the Xitami FTP server with a Browser to get, put,dir,etc commands?

If so, can you please provide an example of the key in to the Browser ADDRESS pane.

THANKS for your help!!!

Jerry



The * for all allowed ftp commands is set to the user that logged in via the browser.

I tried building Xitami from source the other day and ended up with:-

[C:\tmp\xiopen]sh boomake build

Can someone give me some indication of what 'c' is supposed to be or where 
it is defined?
