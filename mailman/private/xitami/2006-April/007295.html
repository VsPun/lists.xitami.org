<PRE>Interesting problem...are you using Xitami FTP or a different FTP server?  Are you certain this isn't an FTP server issue and not a windows issue?  I know that HTTP file uploading generates temp files in the windows designated temp folder (typicially: c:\temp ) What kind of files are being loaded - images? Does it matter the file type?  Can you force this &quot;thumbs.db&quot; file to a specific location.

To be honest, I haven't heard of anything like this before, other than the HTTP upload temp files, thus is the reason I think that this is an ftp server issue.

  i have a handful of web-masters on my xitami service (all windows users), who regularly upload entire folder-loads of web-content (drag and drop), to their own 'uniquely assigned' web-space directories, via ftp.

  this all seems to work well, but i'm constantly coming behind them, cleaning up and deleting useless (windows generated) &quot;thumbs.db&quot; files by the hundreds, which are strewn about the entire file-system, in scattered locations throughout.  they are a general nuisance really, and a complete waste of good resources, especially if they wind up getting indexed by search robots.  some robots will continue checking back for &quot; thumbs.db&quot; files repeatedly, even months after they've been deleted.

  because &quot;thumbs.db&quot; is a hidden windows file, most of my users aren't even aware they exist... which makes it extremely difficult for some of them to understand exactly what they are, where they've come from, how they've become mixed with their web-site content, or why their existence so often generates various errors as they attempt to manipulate files on the server. 

   - is there a way to set up a filter in xitami, which will prevent any files by the name of &quot;thumbs.db&quot; from being uploaded?

  and if so:

   - can it be set up to function transparently, so the user is never aware that any filtering or roll-off has taken place?

  an example of such an edit, would be kindly appreciated,
  thank you.

  rick
