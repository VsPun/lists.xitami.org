<PRE>i have a handful of web-masters on my xitami service (all windows users),
who regularly upload entire folder-loads of web-content (drag and drop), to
their own 'uniquely assigned' web-space directories, via ftp.

this all seems to work well, but i'm constantly coming behind them, cleaning
up and deleting useless (windows generated) &quot;thumbs.db&quot; files by the
hundreds, which are strewn about the entire file-system, in scattered
locations throughout.  they are a general nuisance really, and a complete
waste of good resources, especially if they wind up getting indexed by
search robots.  some robots will continue checking back for &quot;thumbs.db&quot;
files repeatedly, even months after they've been deleted.

because &quot;thumbs.db&quot; is a hidden windows file, most of my users aren't even
aware they exist... which makes it extremely difficult for some of them to
understand exactly what they are, where they've come from, how they've
become mixed with their web-site content, or why their existence so often
generates various errors as they attempt to manipulate files on the server.

 - is there a way to set up a filter in xitami, which will prevent any files
by the name of &quot;thumbs.db&quot; from being uploaded?

and if so:

 - can it be set up to function transparently, so the user is never aware
that any filtering or roll-off has taken place?

an example of such an edit, would be kindly appreciated,
thank you.
