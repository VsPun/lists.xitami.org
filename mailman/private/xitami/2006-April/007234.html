<PRE>Yes.  However, it's been a long time since I purchased my copy, so I'm sure
the full tech support has expired.   I am hoping I can still get assistance
with setting this up, as I never really had the chance to get it working in
the first place.

If I am not wrong on this, and I might be,  but SSL is only a part of the
full paid version of Xitami including a year of tech support, am I right?

Hi all.  I have been an avid user of Xitami for several years now.  I have
rarely run into problems with it.  A while back, was planning on setting up
an SSL section to run a small store using perl.  The military ended up
having me deploy, so I never got around to completing this setup.
 
I have reloaded my server, and recovered from crashes, and reinstalled from
backups countless times (normally due to my own mistakes).  I have Xitami
Pro, v2.5c2, but I don't think I have any of the SSL configuration files, or
even a copy so I can modify one.
 
In my server settings, under Advanced, I have one checkbox that says Enable
SSL Interface? Which is checked, of course, and the box underneath that has
the configuration file to use, which right now has sslhttp.cfs in it.
 
I don't have such a file, and if I were to make one, I have no idea what
format to make the configuration file.  If you can help me build this file,
I think I can then set up the SSL side of my server.
 
Any information to help me fix this would help.  Thanks.
 
Matthew Jones
