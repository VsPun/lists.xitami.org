<PRE>hmmm...
    perhaps i should explain &quot;thumbs.db&quot;, and how (and where) it's
originating.

i'm not sure what version of windows first introduced the thumbnail view of
images within win-explorer (as an alternative to standard file icons), but
it's this exact feature which creates and makes use of the &quot;thumbs.db&quot; files
i describe.

for example, if you're viewing the contents of a folder in explorer, then
reach up to the &quot;view&quot; menu and select &quot;thumbnail&quot;... the icons for all
common graphics-types, will instantly become thumbnails-images.  some
windows users simply keep their folder-view settings adjusted this way right
across the board...  i believe, it may actually be the default
folder-view with fresh windows installs.  (it's something that i always turn
off immediately)

regardless...  the moment that a windows user switches to the
thumbnail-view, &quot;thumbs.db&quot; (a hidden system file) gets created within that
folder... and acts as a thumbnail cache of sorts, so windows doesn't have to
keep re-building the thumbnails each time the folder is viewed.

(each and every folder will have it's own &quot;thumbs.db&quot; file, if/when
applicable.)

it means that someone could easily have one folder with five jpeg images in
it... and only be able to see a total of 5 files... but in actual fact,
there are 6 (if you include the hidden &quot;thumbs.db&quot;).

if that entire folder (or a select-all of it's contents) is uploaded to my
(xitami-only) server via ftp, *all six files will transfer* during the
upload session (&quot;thumbs.db&quot; included)... and not just the 5 which were
intended by the user.  these &quot;thumbs.db&quot; files aren't even visible to the
user until after they've been uploaded... which causes most of them a great
deal of confusion, if and when they are found.

if a folder is dragged and dropped into an ftp-session, it makes sense to me
that all it's contents will be transferred with it, whether some of the
file-attributes are set to &quot;hidden&quot; or not.

this brings me back to my original question actually... because i feel if i
had a way to instruct xitami-ftp to simply disallow the upload of any file
by the name &quot;thumbs.db&quot;, my problem would instantly be solved.

i clearly understand what these files are, and how they are being uploaded
by users on my system unintentionally... i just want to firewall them, if
that's at all possible.

sorry if i've bored most of you with my lengthily description... but would
really appreciate any advice that anyone here may be able to provide.

thanks again,

rick

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i have a handful of web-masters on my xitami service (all windows users),
</I>&gt;<i> who regularly upload entire folder-loads of web-content (drag and drop), to
</I>&gt;<i> their own 'uniquely assigned' web-space directories, via ftp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this all seems to work well, but i'm constantly coming behind them,
</I>&gt;<i> cleaning up and deleting useless (windows generated) &quot;thumbs.db&quot; files by
</I>&gt;<i> the hundreds, which are strewn about the entire file-system, in scattered
</I>&gt;<i> locations throughout.  they are a general nuisance really, and a complete
</I>&gt;<i> waste of good resources, especially if they wind up getting indexed by
</I>&gt;<i> search robots.  some robots will continue checking back for &quot; thumbs.db&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> files repeatedly, even months after they've been deleted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> because &quot;thumbs.db&quot; is a hidden windows file, most of my users aren't even
</I>&gt;<i> aware they exist... which makes it extremely difficult for some of them to
</I>&gt;<i> understand exactly what they are, where they've come from, how they've
</I>&gt;<i> become mixed with their web-site content, or why their existence so often
</I>&gt;<i> generates various errors as they attempt to manipulate files on the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - is there a way to set up a filter in xitami, which will prevent any
</I>&gt;<i> files by the name of &quot;thumbs.db&quot; from being uploaded?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and if so:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - can it be set up to function transparently, so the user is never aware
</I>&gt;<i> that any filtering or roll-off has taken place?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> an example of such an edit, would be kindly appreciated,
</I>&gt;<i> thank you.
