<PRE>I have been running Xitami since 1999 and I have had great success on windows 98, SE, ME, 2000, and XP pro until now.
Currently I am running XP pro and Xitami v2.4d10 

I have set up users and passwords pointing to individual directories in my ftproot. I had this running very well pre SP2 and there were no problems.  I'm not sure what happened.  I have since reinstalled XP pro with only SP1.  I am still experiencing the same problem.  My ISP (an educational institution) had poked holes in the firewall back in 1999 for http and ftp for my IP address.  I checked with them and nothing has changed.  
FTP works in house, but not outside the LAN.

So what might be at issue here?
How do I set up security permissions in XP pro for Xitami?
Do I have to set up set up &quot;matching&quot; user accounts in XP pro to allow users access to their directories?  How do I set up file permissions in XP pro folders?

I had done this in the past and it worked with matching user names and passwords.  But now things are not.  Help......
