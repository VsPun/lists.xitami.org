<PRE>Okay, looking for the LAST word.

Windows 98SE and xisrv32.exe - can it be made to work?

Thanks,
Charles

config:
Xitami 2.5c2 (xidos32.exe called in STARTUP); Win98SE on P166 old timer with
256MB.
Other stuff: Fictional Daemon FTP, Mercury Mail, PHP, MySQL, ZoneAlarm, AVG.
No partridges or pears.
All seems to play well together and its been 55 days since last reboot.

BTW: latest version of Xitami has defeated a wierd &quot;smthttp: error on socket
160&quot; error I kept getting previously.  Yeah!  Don't know what it means.
Glad it's gone.  error &lt;=&gt; bad!

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to figure
out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you figure out
what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami
2. In the \xitami\win32 folder, copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory. Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type &quot;cd\xitami&quot; to change to the xitami
directory. Then type &quot;xisrv32.exe -i&quot; to install the service. The service is
now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run &quot;xisrv32.exe -u&quot;.

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into services
and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and start it there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you may
need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with an
account that has access.

</I>&gt;<i> I have been running a small web site on Xitami for a few
</I>&gt;<i> years, first the console version and now the GUI. I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to run it as a service if possible, but I can't get it
</I>&gt;<i> to go that way. The documentation hasn't helped much. Running
</I>&gt;<i> xisrv32.exe does not seem to do anything. I have placed it
</I>&gt;<i> and the Control Panel (xicpl32.cpl) in the Windows System32
</I>&gt;<i> folder, but although I can see and open the Xitami Control
</I>&gt;<i> Panel, nothing happens when I try to start it. The control
</I>&gt;<i> panel shows its status as suspended. I can launch any of the
</I>&gt;<i> standard executables (xitami.exe, xidos32.exe, and
</I>&gt;<i> xigui32.exe) and the web server starts right up. If any one
</I>&gt;<i> out there has managed to run Xitami as a Windows service, can
</I>&gt;<i> you let me know what it is I need to do? I have not been able
</I>&gt;<i> to get it to work with either Windows 2000 or Windows XP. Thanks.
