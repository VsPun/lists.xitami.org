Hi there

I got a problem with a script that queryes a big database and it seem's that the script always runs in a timeout, 
also I never received any msg about that. 

Tryed the webform the normal way and tryed AJAX -style, 
also tryed sleep(45) instead of the query... ( sleep(25) works, (30) sometimes )

The query needs about 40 seconds to complete in MS SQL Server Manager and 
Xitami always returns just the HTML-parts before that query.

I set the timeout in Xitami to 6000 and that one in php.ini to the same value, still w/o any success.

working on that since days now, would be nice if someone can help me... ?

Xitami 2.5 Port 88  /  IIS6 Port 80
PHP 5
Win IE / FireFox
MSSQL Server 2005   (no timeout)

Under Xitami's CGI section is the "
Timeout for CGI programs:"...if you extend that out to 60 or 90 seconds that should be sufficient for you.  Most of scripts work in under 10 seconds from the DB query...but I do have a few, mostly administrative, that take up to 3 minutes.  

The other setting "check cgi processes every" : x milliseconds could be set lower too, but that increases cpu processing.  Another place to increase timers is with "Server Keep Alive Connections"...if you increase the amount allowed and the actual timeout, it may help speed things up for repetitive queries.  but again, anytime you increase numbers you increase memory and cpu usage.

And lastly, you can always speed Xitami up by making it "Turbo"...but that doesn't necessarily mean it will speed your DB queries up on large searches.

I am not sure since I dont use MS SQL but prefer MySQL.
Many dbms have default timeout sessions that block queries running for a 
long time.
The problem is not Xitami since that can be 60 second time out but more 
likely your MS SQL configuration.

Hi first of all thank you for fast responding

--Under Xitami's CGI section is the "
Timeout for CGI programs:"...  - I did that, with values from 90 to 6000 seconds
--"Server Keep Alive Connections" - will try that, but since there is only one connection...

The problem is that Xitami not seemed to be interested in my settings, the original timout is 60 seconds and I never reached that.

again, thanks

   Uwe
