Hello,

I have been a Xitami list subsciber for years.  I have also used the FTP =
portion of Xitami for years.  I know that there are many of you who =
would tell me not to use the FTP portion of Xitami as I see people told =
that all the time.  I have been using it for years without issue under =
98, ME, XP, and Mandrake Linux.  I have received 2 .rar (WinRAR) files =
from a client.  Usually, I get .rar files fine, but both of these are =
over 500 Meg.  I have never tried to receive files of this size over =
xitami before.

Both files are fine on his side, but on mine (the Xitami side), the file =
headers are corrupt, and cannot be repaired by any program including =
RAR, WinRAR, AZR, etc that I can find.  In fact, it is corrupted so bad =
that all programs say &quot;no files found&quot;.  So, it seems that I have 2 =
files each consisting of over 500 Meg of non-translatable garbage.

Now, my question is:

1) Is there an actual known filesize limit factor in Xitami FTP?
2) If not, is there anything else that could be wrong (new XP Pro =
install (no SPs) running xigui32 2.5c1 )
3) If there is, and its not just something stupid in XP that I didn't =
think about, is there a freebie or cheap FTP program that someone has =
experience with that has no problem with filesizes &gt; 1 Gig (to be safe)?

I know how to disable Xitami FTP and run another FTP program instead.  I =
was looking for real answers, not simple bashing of xitami ftp, or =
biased but unexperienced FTP server favorites - not that it happens THAT =
often on here, but it has.  If Xitami can't do it, I need an FTP that =
someone KNOWS can.  I can fail once in a client's eyes, but I cannot =
make them spend another entire day uploading files that are just going =
to corrupt again.  I'm not trying to sound arrogant, but I do know what =
I am doing for the most part.

Experienced answers only please . . .

Thanks,

- Jay Aldrich
