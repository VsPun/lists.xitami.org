<PRE>Hi Mike,

I have been a member here for some years now and this has been discussed
many times.

I am so used to it that it doesn't bother me but I do read the posts just in
case someone has a fix.

If it was a memory problem it would have gone away some time during my
upgrades and other programs would be effected by the memory problem unless
it is something in the web server causing the memory problem.

I have not tried anything to fix it and I honestly don't expect anything to
fix it.

One thing I do notice is that like me most of the people having problems are
amd users so maybe its an amd thing ...anyone out there seeing this on non
amd machines ?

My last 3 upgrades have been amd 500, 800 and now 1200 and thinking back on
it, I didn't have this before the 500 upgrade ( I don't think).
