<PRE>Hi,

I happen to have a little piece of software that I wrote for myself, just in
case the Xitami was going to fail while I was traveling. I guess it might be
of use to some people. It is a LRWP process that connects to port 81. Once
Xitami crashes, the LRWP socket is disconnected and a xitami process restart
is attempted a specified number of times. Optionally this tool was sending
notification emails to my account and I could check on the log of
crashes/restarts through a simple dynamic page generated by the same
program. I anyone wants to use it let me know and I'll make it available. It
has not been tested on other than Win2k and winNT4 because it works only
with the service version of xitami. Also, it is not a service itself, needs
a user to be logged on and it goes on the system tray waiting for xitami to
crash or to serve the dynamic log page. It pops up on crashes, attempts a
restart then either goes back again or dies if it can't restart the server.
It has no supporting documentation since is just a simple, self explanatory
tool meant for my personal use. I take no responsibility for bad things that
might cause to your computer although I can assure that it does not contain
viruses/backdoor trojans/other nasty things etc.

&gt;<i> Yeah, I thought of that, but it is not really an option. If I am
</I>&gt;<i> out of town
</I>&gt;<i> working, then it could be hours and hours before I have the opportunity to
</I>&gt;<i> check it. If, however, there is a utility I can run that would re-start
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami if it has crashed and then check every so often, that is a much
</I>&gt;<i> better solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the assist though!
