<PRE>Hi,


&gt;<i> #1. Do I have to uninstall the current version of Xitami that I have?
</I>Yes. Unfortunately the service version does not coexists with the
non-service version and although you can chose to install them in separate
folders, the registry keys get overwritten. Before you uninstall, make an
image of the whole xitami folder.

&gt;<i> #2. Can I install it to the same directory as the current install
</I>&gt;<i> of Xitami?
</I>Yes, providing you backed up all config files. Xitami offers a backup
process when it installs but I think it is better that you make an image of
your website in some separate location, just in case.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #3. If I make a copy of all the config file and then copy them back or to
</I>&gt;<i> the new directory (whatever is needed), will the new service version have
</I>&gt;<i> the same setup as what I have now?
</I>In theory yes. There's no easy way assert this. You may have to visually
compare the new config files with the old ones. Also making a copy of the
new config files, just before you overwrite them with your old may help in
spotting differences.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #4. Is there still a windows based administration panel for the service
</I>&gt;<i> version?
</I>Yes, I am using it constantly.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #5. Is there anything else I need to be prepared for with the service
</I>&gt;<i> version?
</I>You may experience problems with log rotation, other than this, I don't
know, maybe no more crashes? :)

&gt;<i> and sure new to the service version. I just don't want to screw up all the
</I>&gt;<i> work I have done to date.
</I>Just make sure you back up everything before.


&gt;<i> Thanks for all of the help!
</I>you're Welcome.

Stefan
