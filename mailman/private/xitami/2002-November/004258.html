<PRE>Not all loads of Windows have problems, I am running Win2kpro and update the
SP and Security often. I am also on an AMD 850 however my wife runs a WinXP
on a Celeron. I use NTFS and she runs FAT. She seems to have more problems
with lockups that I do. One of microsoft problems is the rush to publish and
live debugging. It is more economical to rush the product out, then debug it
in the field, hence Service Packs. Win2kpro is based on NT and as we all
know NT is much more stable than Win95/98/ME. And NTFS is more stable than
FAT. I think (and it just my opionion) that Microsoft has spent much more
time on NT/Win2kPro than any other because it is the systems used by the big
corporations. I don't really want to put the blame on anyone but it just
might be a combination of the products that you are using from Xitami all
the way down to the chipset of the motherboard. Believe it or not, Memory
can check good using a memory tester but if it's mis-matched will cause
problems. Hence a problem we had at Bellsouth and Compaq PC's. One group
added memory modules from a different manufacture to all the PC's, all the
memory was good but yet it caused the BSOD...often. After we put matched the
memory the problems went away.

Sorry for the long post
