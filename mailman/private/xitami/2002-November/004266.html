<PRE>I don't know if anyone has thought of this, but it does tie into the web 
server and could possibly be causing the problem!  At least, it is 
something else someone else can try to work out.

But first:  how many of us (Xitami admins) are moving database data, 
especially ODBC Access data?  On another list, I believe the DBI list, 
someone submitted an email re:  raising the buffer size from 2048Kb to 
~32768Kb.  Myself, I only raised the buffer to 10240Kb, but it has 
decreased the amount that Xitami has been crashing.

I'd like to hear some input from someone more knowledgeable.  Even if 
it doesn't affect Xitami in any way, I am recognizing that a dramatic 
increase in the database buffer size (2048Kb is default), does decrease 
the server response time for queries.  Well worth a try, even if it doesn't 
prevent Xitami from crashing.
