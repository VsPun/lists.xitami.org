<PRE>There are two other things that can cause errors:

1) The board getting hot.
2) Dirty RAM chips.

I had an old Packard Smell years ago that seems to get errors for no
apparent reason. While I was examining the running system with covers in
place, it ran like a champ. As soon as I put the covers back on, it started
producing random errors in different applicatons.

One thing that happened recently...I was running a program (it may have been
Norton something) and it said I had an error in RAM....and I tested several
times with the same result.  I opened my machine, pulled out the RAM chips,
used a pencil erasor on the edge connectors and reseated them. The &quot;error&quot;
went away.

I'm not saying either of these is your problem. But it's possible. That it's
an AMD and that it's 400MHz is not an issue. I mentioned earlier running on
a machine with 64 megs. It also happens to be AMD 200 mmx (an old IBM
Aptiva). I also tested the same version of Xitami on my newer XP machine
(1.4GHz and 512 mb RAM) in Win98 compatibility mode and it runs like a champ
on it. Speaking of compatiblity mode....does Win2000 have one. If it does,
use it.

&gt;<i> Nope, not a pre-install and not a Compaq. I installed myself and when this
</I>&gt;<i> was going on earlier I already wiped everything and started over. It is
</I>&gt;<i> Win2K with SP3 (having the same problems with SP2) on an AMD K6-2 400MHz
</I>&gt;<i> with 256 megs of RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am pretty much at my wits end here.
