<PRE>Hi,

Just adding some thoughts to this thread. I run XiPro 4d10 on NT4 SP6 and
the only crashes I experienced (very few) were related either to the FTP or
to SSL.  The server load is small and I sometimes not boot the machine for
months.

I am also using XiPro on my workstation for testing/developing. For a while
I tried to follow some advice and work as a power user rather than an
administrator on my workstation. I noticed that Xitami behaves really
strange when one (as power user) tries to even open the setup dialog. This
did not last long since I use to do a lot of admin stuff/debugging on my
workstation and I assumed that xitami code was not developed with access
rights in mind for Win2k (as some other new software does) and speculate
that there might be crashes related to this when one plays with the access
rights on folders/files. Occasionally I use ODBC and these applications do
crash sometimes, however, the webserver is not affected, only the connected
LRWP process dies.


Stefan
