<PRE>Richard:

Well, I found what looks to be a nice memory tester at
<A HREF="http://www.simtester.com">http://www.simtester.com</A> and ran it. Seems to be pretty indepth on the tests
that it does...Walk Data, Walk Address, MATS+, March B, March C-,
Checkerboard, Burst and Moving Inversion. All of that does not mean a damn
thing to me, but it took about 20 minutes to complete and it passed all
tests.

I recently purchased a &quot;blower&quot; for this PC and have yet to install it. It
installs like a card and is supposed to move about 12 cfm of air. I have a
decent fan in the front of the machine. Guess I will get that installed
tomorrow and see if it makes any difference at all.

What bothers me though is that Xitami registers that an error has taken
place and that the program is shutting down. But, like I said...when you
check the crash log and error log there is nothing there. So, I am at a bit
of a loss in figuring out what the hell the deal is. And this seems to be
the only thing that crashes. Nothing else gets effected at all. Very
strange...

Thanks!

Mike
