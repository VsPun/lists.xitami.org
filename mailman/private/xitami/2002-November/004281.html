<PRE>Thanks Thomas,
No, I have no updates. Never been contacted for any. I guess I'll just have
to continue to keep my eyes on the server. I am monitoring it continuously.
I hope that I covered all obvious holes and that nobody becomes interested
in hacking it because I know it is possible. I also hope that no hacker will
actually spend time on finding out how they can hack xitami since the SSL
code is statically liked into xitami executable rather than being a dll or a
separate module.

Stefan

&gt;<i> Stefan, has iMatix updated XiPro recently to fix the serious security
</I>&gt;<i> issues pertaining to SSLeay embedded in their code base (that is, have you
</I>&gt;<i> received any updated executables from iMatix)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The last I knew, they have not updated the server and this leaves the
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami Pro web server open to several __very__ serious security
</I>&gt;<i> issues that
</I>&gt;<i> allow multiple buffer overflow attacks (at least one of which code already
</I>&gt;<i> exists).  iMatix has known about these attacks for about 3 months now and
</I>&gt;<i> as far as I know they have done nothing about it.  If they have fixed this
</I>&gt;<i> problem, then that is one more thing that can be checked off of
</I>&gt;<i> my internal
</I>&gt;<i> bug list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
