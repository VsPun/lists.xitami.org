<PRE>Hi,
Just keep in mind that almost everything is possible. The only variable is
how much time and effort you want to invest in making it possible. As you
grow from a newbie to a more advanced user you'll eventually find out.

Not a joke. Depends on how u see it.  Newbie question. sorry.
    I just wondered if there was a way so they didnt see the ip address in
the address bar.  Guess its not possibly.
    Sorry

Hello all./ newbie question here.  I have set up an Xitami server and was
curious if there was anyway at all to hide my ip address from users who
access the page.
    Thanks to anyone who has any thoughts.
        Cheers

This is supposed to be a joke, isn't it?
