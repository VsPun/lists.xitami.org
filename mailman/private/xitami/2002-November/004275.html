<PRE>OK...I am gonna give it a shot to move to the service version of Xitami and
see if that does anything for my crashing problem. Thing is, I really don't
want to toast anything that is already set up as I went through hell getting
it going in the first place. So, I have a couple of questions.

#1. Do I have to uninstall the current version of Xitami that I have?

#2. Can I install it to the same directory as the current install of Xitami?

#3. If I make a copy of all the config file and then copy them back or to
the new directory (whatever is needed), will the new service version have
the same setup as what I have now?

#4. Is there still a windows based administration panel for the service
version?

#5. Is there anything else I need to be prepared for with the service
version?

Sorry for all of the (what must be) newbie questions, but I am new to Xitami
and sure new to the service version. I just don't want to screw up all the
work I have done to date.

Thanks for all of the help!

Mike
