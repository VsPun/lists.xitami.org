<PRE>Hello Craig Morrison you transmitted about OT: Good Job -&gt; Re: [Xitami] Re 
Change of IP address


I am a lurking memer for about 4 years now and i've seen it more on this 
list, and i must admit one doesn't se it often on others. Most of my 
questions were always answered by browsing the list history files or it's 
just a current topic.

That may be said once in a while as you just did.

Xitami is great for many things but for me it's about the most 
userfriendliest webserver there is no matter what OS you're using with it.

Grts
Ted.


&gt;<i>I've been following this thread with anticipation to see if the issue
</I>&gt;<i>was ever going to get resolved. I'm glad to see it did.
</I>
&gt;<i>I must say that the patience I saw helping Linda get through this was
</I>&gt;<i>astounding. Something that you just don't see everyday, nor on many
</I>&gt;<i>other support lists (where they would have screamed RTFM).
</I>
&gt;<i>I tip my hat to you fine folks, this was very well done indeed.

</PRE>
