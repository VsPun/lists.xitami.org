<PRE>alright... i'll admit,

there were several very simple points in this thread that were flying
clear over my head until reading this last post, and realizing where
some folks in this forum may be getting confused or having
difficulties changing file-extensions.

one of the &quot;stupidest&quot; defaults (in windows at least), is how it hides
file-extensions from the user.  this (in my opinion) drastically
reduces a users' control and overall experience... and could easily
wind up leaving them vulnerable to all sorts of other nasty little
things that simply cannot be detected at a glance.

when setting up or taking charge of a new windows machine for personal
use, one of the very first things i do, is disable the extension-mask.
   - in windows explorer, click the [tools] menu
   - select [folder options]
   - go to the [view] tab
   - and 'un'-check the [hide file extensions for known file types] box
   - [apply], [ok]... and carry on

this 'should' allow you to see clearly, all file-extensions right
across the board... where they can be changed, simply by renaming the
file.
   - right-click / rename
or
   - single left-click a file-name that's currently highlighted

q )  how do i create a &quot;.cfg&quot; or &quot;.aut&quot; file???
a )  i don't.  i create a simple text file, then rename it.  :)

i personally fail to see anything difficult or complicated about that.
