<PRE>i first became aware of this default &quot;extension mask&quot; (as well as how
to disable it) when i migrated from win-3.1 to win-98 (first edition).
 i recall being extremely angry that win-98 had hidden the
extensions... but the problem was quickly corrected, upon calling the
shop where the pc was purchased.

these days, i frequently use an assortment of different (o/s &amp;/or)
windows versions... but must say that i'm not personally familiar with
nt4.

many people laugh hysterically when i say this, but my 'personal' most
favourite pc of all, is an old p-600 (with 768mb. of ram)... running
win-millennium (same install of m/e since october 2001).  i've spent a
lot of time tweaking and optimizing that machine... and getting it
tuned up just the way i like it.  it's far more stable, and (for the
best part) out-performs any other system i own... including this
crappy 3 month old lap-top that came factory installed with xp-home.

what's my point?

the &quot;best&quot; system of all, is the one that works well for you.  beware
of the man with the flashy sales-pitch.
