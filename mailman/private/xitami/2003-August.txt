I'm evaluating the latest Windows Xitami/Pro but can't 
connect to the https side of the server. Is SSL only 
enabled after purchasing the server? Thank you.

Could someone offer me some installation instructions and

Subject: [Xitami] Server load too high
Message-ID: <3F32A4F3.31157.1B0C8C34@localhost>

I've been getting some strange errors as of late.  I run a ikonboard 
forum (and 3 other forums) under Xitami (console) 2.4d9 and perl 
on Win2k.  The system is a Athlon 1000Mzh with 256 Megs of ram.  
The system is strictly dedicated to Xitami/Mysql for my CGI needs.  
I figured my server would be pretty well equipped for light to 
moderate use.

However more and more I get the error "Server load too high."  
Between all the different forums there doesn't seem to be more 
than 20-30 people connected most the time.  So I don't understand 
why the server is overloaded?

Anyone with experience with this error and how to fix it?

  Thanks!  Gene

Use Watchdog-O-Matic professional.  I do and it works very well.  It costs
30 dollars but well worth it.

It will automatically kill Xitami and restart a new instance for you.

Search for it on the web and you will find some sites to download it from.

This error may be unrelated.  I see these kinds of errors from time to time
in the crash log.  Check your site visit log to see what was happening at
that very moment of the crash.  Quite often, in my case, when Xitami decides
to blow up, there aren't any current site visitors that I can attribute the

You'll probably just have to live with it.

The visit logs don't show any activity when the crash occurs, that's another thing that leads me to believe it's an openssl exploit ... if an attacker attacks me with an openssl exploit I won't see that in the logs because xitami will crash before it can record it in the logs ...
we've resorted to wrapping xitami in a batch file so that when it crashes it will dump a netstat -a to a file and then restart itself ... in the netstat dump you can see that port 443 is not open, port 80 still has some open connections, but 443 is no where to be found ...
you could conclude that it's a timing thing, however from looking in the logs I can see that there were some ssl connections to the web server within a minute of the crash ... so there should be some sign of those connections (at least a TIME_WAIT) still in the netstat ...

anyone know how to debug the crash log line?

It's a windows "feature".
Because there is already a file.exe in the download directory, the new file 
is renamed.

I only have this problem with IE.  NS and Gecko based browsers do not do
this.  It is not because windows has a file already named the same because I
have flushed ALL temp dirs and download dirs but still get this effect.  I
think it has something to do with the way IE and Xatimi talk to each other.

I don't know if anyone else has noticed this problem, but I tried =
realligning the location of the cgi-bin from E:\Xitami\cgi-bin to =
E:\Xitami\Webpages\cgi-bin to make the physical location of the cgi =
directory closer reflect the virtual location (as typed in the browser =
bar).

The problem is that, while Xitami then recognises cgi-bin as a cgi =
directory, it does not recognise CGI-BIN, or any other variation in =
case. All anyone has to do is change the case of the cgi directory in =
the URL bar of their browser, and, unless the script has been cached by =
the server, the visitor will be prompted to download the perl script.

As a temporary measure, you can enter the administration panel and =
change:

In the server settings,  change 'CGI URLs start with' to '/', and=20
In the CGI settings, check 'Allow file mixing'.

Xitami now decides by itself whether it is an executable script or not, =
without reference to its location.

Who get's this error? The server admin, or the user?
What do you have the maximum number of connections set to?

Increase the timeout for cgi programs.
A good value is 15 to 60 seconds.
You get this error if the cgi program don't terminate within the time limit.

It is also possible that MySQL is responding too slowly and that the php 
program is waiting for a response. Look at the Task Manager to check which 
program is using most time slices.

I've installed xitami for the first time and I'm trying to get ssi to work, 
but after 6 hours now. I give up.
Can someone please tell me how to get ssi to work.
I only get this message.

#include file not found: e:\www\index.shtml/test.txt
[perlssi: "#include file="test.txt" " produced errors]

the test.txt is locaded in the same directory as test.shtml where i put 
<!--#include file="test.txt" -->
And those files are locaded in e:\www\

Please can someone tell me what to do?

Hi 
Very short on time, but I think your problem is the location of the file in xitami check where you have specified it chances are it is being defaulted to c:\ try putting the include file there obviously this will have to be change but if you kn ow where it is defaulting to you can then add directory

Might be a quickie this one:

Has anyone had any probs with the 95/NT build of xitami where is throws
up a dialog box telling you when the service was started while meanwhile
it hangs at 'Suspended' in the background? When you click 'OK', the
xitami process is terminated!

I've checked the access log and there is nothing in there which suggests
anyone was screwing around trying to hack it.. (although I've seen many
attempts from people that have tried with the
addresstoolongprobleminIIS!)

Any ideas anyone?
I know, I know...    get the unix based version...   but any serious
ideas? Lol

Cheers,
Stu

I'm sorry, but I didn't understand that. I've sat the default web directory 
to e:\www
And both index.shtml with the include command. and the file i want to 
include is in e:\www or /www/ =)

I looked at the Perlssi file in the xitami directory, to check if the 
config was right, but I didn't understand much of that.

Anyhow, this is the error message I get. If I didn't post it the last time =)

#include file not found: e:\www\index.shtml/test.shtml
[perlssi: "#include file="test.shtml" " produced errors]

It has been a long time since I last had SSI set for Xitami, but, to the 
best of my recollection, you have to go into the Xiatami web-based 
administrator, proceed to Configuration, then to Filters.

In the Filters menu's left column, enter the suffix (i.e., .shtml) of the type 
of SSI file you want to use (mapping the suffix to the filter program).  In 
the right column, enter the location of the 'perlssi' file.  I believe this is 
in your Xitami web server directory.

Choose to save our settings.

Now, try your test again.  That should route all shtml files through the 
server, past the filter, back to the server and out to your clients.

Sincerely,
Brad Smith

Thank you, Brad Smith.
But it still doesn't work.
I get  [perlssi: "#include file="test.shtml" " produced errors]

But <!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" --> works fine =)
