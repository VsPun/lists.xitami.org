Steve, do you mean that you enter 24.209.120.13 when within your own =
network, if so that will not work, need to be on the outside, another =
computer accessing from somewhere other than your own place. The setup =
appears to be fine. I accessed your site at 24... and it loads fine. =
Even went to the link on The ORIGINAL DARWIN... and it loads, went to =
one of the links from there, fine. It appears to me that your setup is =
working as you want it to. I would say you are doing nothing wrong.

  Subject: [Xitami] web server w/ router (again)


  Ive posted a couple of times now about trying to run the xitami web =
server from my computer.  It's set up pn a broadband connection that is =
shared with a Linksys router between two computers.  I set this computer =
(Windows XP)  to have a manual IP of 192.168.1.2  (the router's IP is =
192.168.1.1) with the subnet mask being set to 255.255.255.0, the =
default gateway as 192.168.1.1.  When I ran ipconfig/all I got 3 DNS =
numbers and put the first two in as my primary and alternate DNS =
servers.  I then set the router up in the advanced/DMZ HOST IP ADDRESS =
to be 192.168.1.2 and turned the Xitami web server on.  When I enter =
<A HREF="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</A> into the browser it goes to the router set-up, which =
is good.  When I try to access pages on the internet, it works, which is =
good.  When I enter <A HREF="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</A> it loads the index.html page I =
put in the Xitami server folder, which is great.  Here's the problem, =
however... when I look up my IP address online (the one assigned to me =
via my ISP) I get 24.209.120.13.  When I enter <A HREF="http://24.209.120.13">http://24.209.120.13</A> into =
my browser, I get nothing, which is bad.  It seems that I have =
everything set up right and straightened out, but I still cant get =
access to the web site Im trying to host from this computer.  What am I =
doing wrong, or what else can I do?
