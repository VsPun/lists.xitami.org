<PRE>Hello Marc!

First of all, thank you very much for you quick reply on my message!

I tested to download (and even upload) files via LAN, on my notebook and on
my workstation. Everything is working fine via LAN, only connection via the
Internet is making problems. I tried to analyze the header- and request- log
files and they say error number 500 (internal error) and 408 (timeout) on
the tests with the files I got some problems to download them. As next I
created a silly big HTML-file (only to test) with a size of r.a. 5 MBytes
and tried to download it. When I download this file via DSL/Cable connection
it worked fine, but when I try to download this file via a Modem (56 KBit/S)
it will stop at 32 KByte. Okay, with DSL/Cable it work - BUT - when I try to
run a CGI on Xitami which produces a HTML-file with a size of r.a. 50 KB it
even will not work via DSL/Cable.

Hmm, you see...I really cannot reproduce this error so I can explain, but to
me it seems that this is on the CGI (see 500/408 errors). But the CGI
temporary out-files (*.cgi *.cgo) will be created successfully by Xitami, so
I really don't know where to locate the error.

My provider allows nealry all ports and there is no limit to transfer datas
from and to my server. The server port 80 is open, and running well when I
connect via Telnet and get the HTTP-headers.

Any ideas?

&gt;<i> &gt;an ADSL-Connection (5MBit/s - ~1M/Bit/s). All was wonderful until
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;yesterday...I was at work and tried to connect to my server (located at

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;transfer and I got only a broken file. I tested around with other big
</I>files
&gt;<i> &gt;and everytime I got the same problem. Then I tested my email-server and
</I>sent
&gt;<i> &gt;these big files to my company email address and this worked fine.
