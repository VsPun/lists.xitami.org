<PRE>Hi all,

Running v2.5c2 on Win2K Server...

The problems:

1.  Using the GUI to select a pipe use doesn't stick.  If it's
set for 256k, for example, and I change it to 512k and hit save I
can go right back in and see that it's still 256k.  I thought I
might have to wait for the 60 second refresh for this to show up
differently, so after waiting for 90 sec I checked and it was
still set to 256k.  I can edit the defaults.cfg file directly to
select 512k and after the refresh it will show up in the GUI.  It
doesn't seem to have any effect though...see problem 2.

2.  Selecting a pipe (actually, editing the defaults.cfg file by
hand due to problem 1) does not seem to have any effect on how
much bandwidth is used.  I've set the pipe all the way down to
32k and a max of 16 connections and I still see 200+ k
utilization by Xitami on the ethernet interface.  Did I miss
something?  It's not 32k PER CONNECTION is it?

Thanks for any help

-Lance
