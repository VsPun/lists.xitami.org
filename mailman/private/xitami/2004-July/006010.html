Welcome to the clan!

Do you have the same problem if you try to download the file form a local 
computer? (a second computer at home connected via LAN).
If this fails too, then the problem will probably be the server computer.
Xitami is known to have a weak ftp server: it's included, but don't rely on it.

Are you allowed to use your ADSL connection for running servers?
Here, most adsl connections don't have a fixed ip and well known server 
ports are blocked.
Did you try to use your webserver with an alternate port? (anything between 
10000 and 32000 is fine)

Just some ideas to begin with.

&gt;<i>Hello Group!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am a new member of this group, and would like to say hello to everyone

</I>&gt;<i>and I really do like it. But I am having one big problem:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am running Xitami WebServer version 2.5c1 on an Windows 2000 machine with
</I>&gt;<i>an ADSL-Connection (5MBit/s - ~1M/Bit/s). All was wonderful until

</I>&gt;<i>home) to download a PDF-Document. After r.a. 32KBytes Xitami stopped the
</I>&gt;<i>transfer and I got only a broken file. I tested around with other big files
</I>&gt;<i>and everytime I got the same problem. Then I tested my email-server and sent
</I>&gt;<i>these big files to my company email address and this worked fine.
