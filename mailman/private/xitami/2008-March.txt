What Hogan said.

McAfee is set up for normal users. Normal users don't run web-servers.

Port 80 OUTbound is normally open (else you could not surf the web).

Port 80 IN-bound on personal firewalls is normally closed to "new" 
connections (blocks Xitami), but passes replies initiated by an outbound 
request (else you could not surf).

This is old but I bet is still relevant:

http://forums.mcafeehelp.com/showthread.php?t=129441

"I'm using personal firewall plus, 2004 version 5. How can I open port 
80 and port 8080 on this firewall?"

"You can open port 80 by going into utilities, system services, put a 
check on port 80, don't see a way to open port 8080 though." ... "On 
that System Services tab, click the ADD button and add the ports that 
you need open."

Xitami may want 21 (FTP) open. And does it like port 81?

 > I was using ZoneAlarm, no problems with that.

ZA may have figured-out that you had a legitimate webserver, or may have 
asked you the first time port 80 was poked and remembered your answer. 
In the past, ZA was generally smarter about uncommon setups.

Message-ID: <OBEJJOEKBPOPNFEJMPFAOEIDCAAA.carylandstan@blueyonder.co.uk>

      Hi,

      I've been using Xitami without any issues for some time now - v2.4d11.
      Always been hosting php based sites.
      Now I'm tring to run ASP pages and it's not happy. Solutions I've read
point to using Instant ASP from Halcyon, but these are some years old, and
iASP and Halcyon don't seem to be around anymore.
      Any suggestions as to the best solution for ASP support in Xitami much
appreciated.


      Thanks,
      stan

Subject: [Xitami] Multi server issue
Message-ID: <BAY127-W42364BEE86076746CB11F1F8000@phx.gbl>



I have two instances of Xitami running, one for production and the other for testing.  Both servers are running on the same system but on different IP addresses (on the same NIC).   However, the test server refuses to start on port 80...any other port it works OR if I comment out the "Portbase=0" the service will start up without an error but I am not able to get to the base page.

Each server is assigned to its own IP address, but both IP addresses reside on the same NIC of the server.  I don't recall having this problem in the past as I have done production and test versions of Xitami at the same time, each using different IP addresses that were on the same NIC.

In this case though, I actually need to turn the test server into a second production server and need it to run on port 80.

Heres the base config of each

/xitamiproduction/xiwinnt.exe
     defaults.cfg
          ip address: 192.168.1.10
          portbase=0
          service-name=Xitami Prodcution

/xitamitest/xiwinnt.exe
     defaults.cfg
          ip address: 192.168.1.11
          portbase=0
          service-name=Xitami Test

If I comment out portbase=0 on the test server the service will start up but nothing will respond to port 80 at http://192.168.1.11.  However, if I don't comment out portbase=0 the service won't even start up.  If I change the portbase to "portbase=2" then the service will start up and the pages are accessible on http://192.168.1.11:82 .  But I need this test server to be up and running on port 80.

Anyone have any ideas as to what is going on?

For the moment addresses don't matter. You have one NIC. It has one Port 
80. If one Xitami server is listening on it then the other Xitami server 
can't listen on it. Simple?

So how do you get past this? Just run one Xitami server. But that leaves 
you with the problem of only being able to serve one web site and you 
want to serve two web sites, a live system and a test system. What to 
do, what to do?

Enter our saviour Virtual Hosts! How to do this is detailed in the 
configuration section of the documentation which can be reached at 
http://<your IP address or domain name here>/xitami or, if your Xitami 
is correctly set up at http://127.0.0.1/

I hope this helps. 8=))

Yea yeah...I know.  And thanks for the sarcasm.  I have a very specific 

instance where I can't use the Virtual Server feature.  So Xitami binds to 

port 80 for all IPs on the NIC then even though the server is only 

responding to requests on one IP?  Technically, you don't bind to port 80 on 

a NIC, you bind to port 80 on an IP address.  So a second IP address should 

have its own available port 80.  I know Apache and others can have servers 

running on port 80 of each IP on the NIC.  I could have sworn Xitami was 

only binding to one IPs port 80.

Hmmm..I do have multiple NICs.  But 
that means I need a second uplink port 
at my ISP - that will cost extra.  
Crap!

I'm sorry, but no sarcasm was intended. I just explained it in the

Each server is assigned to its own IP address, but both IP addresses reside
on the same NIC of the server.  I don't recall having this problem in the
past as I have done production and test versions of Xitami at the same time,
each using different IP addresses that were on the same NIC.

You will need to use "local" addresses for your servers.

if you can't use virtual hosts... can you use a different port (ie. port 81 
for your test server)?

i have never tried to install xitami with 1 nic, 2 ip's, and 2 xitami 
servers so i don't have an answer to your real question.

what is your specific reason for not being able to run a virtual host???

Yea yeah...I know.  And thanks for the sarcasm.  I have a very specific

instance where I can't use the Virtual Server feature.  So Xitami binds to

port 80 for all IPs on the NIC then even though the server is only

responding to requests on one IP?  Technically, you don't bind to port 80 on

a NIC, you bind to port 80 on an IP address.  So a second IP address should

have its own available port 80.  I know Apache and others can have servers

running on port 80 of each IP on the NIC.  I could have sworn Xitami was

only binding to one IPs port 80.

Hmmm..I do have multiple NICs.  But
that means I need a second uplink port
at my ISP - that will cost extra.
Crap!

 > You have one NIC. It has one Port 80.

No. The NIC doesn't even know what an IP is, much less a port. If it 
gets a packet it passes it to the TCP/IP service. This examines the IP 
and port, checks a list of what programs have requested to bind to what 
IP:port combinations, and passes the packet to the program indicated.

It isn't a hardware thing. We know that multiple webservers will work 
over one NIC. A second NIC is not the answer and sure will confuse you.

It is possible you found an oversight (bug) in Xitami or your TCP/IP demon.

IMHO it is far more likely a configuration error. Xitami has many ways 
to find configuration data. The default bind is to "All IPs". My 2 cents 
says there is another .CFG file which is binding all IPs to the first 
copy which starts, leaving the second copy stranded.

Use 'netstat -an' to see what IP:ports are "Listening". Since the basic 
netstat may not indicate -which- program is listening, see what it says 
when each server is started alone.

Hi Russel

Have you try a reverse proxy server. These are proxys for servers not 
clients like internet express, etc. There is a free one from "at32.com" 
that may fix your problem. Good luck.

Hi,

I've been using Xitami without any issues for some time now - v2.4d11.
Always been hosting php based sites.
Now I'm tring to run ASP pages and it's not happy. Solutions I've read point
to using Instant ASP from Halcyon, but these are some years old, and iASP
and Halcyon don't seem to be around anymore.
Any suggestions as to the best solution for ASP support in Xitami much
appreciated.

Thanks,
stan

Hi I have a simular? question, i am using Xitami to host domain names for friends and family, i register each TLD with an ISP and list my names servers, what i would like to do is to be able to have sub domains or child domain from my server, do i need to create them on the apache module or in my dns module, each time i do it, i just can't seem to get it to work. Does anyone have any idea on how i can get it to work.
?
?
Regards
Michael

Paul,
 
Thanks.  This is the kind of info I was looking for.  Port 80 is dependent per IP as its a tcp issue.  I checked 'netstat -na' and see only see Port 80 bound to the first server.  There is no other port 80 on any of the other IPs on the NIC.  Currently the second IP has port 5080 bound to it which is what I had to set that second server to just to come up.  But changing that second server back to port 80 prevents the service from starting.
 
The NIC currently has 3 IPs, each IP serves different sevcies (dns, smtp, pop, http, etc).  I am using Windows Advanced Server 2003 and was pretty certain that I previously did this type of configuration but couldn't recall if I ran both IPs with port 80 or one on port 80 and the other on another port.
 
Can anyone else test this for me to see what results you get?  Simply add another IP to your nic, stop your xitami service and copy the xitami folder to a new folder (otherwise the defaults.cfg file will get corrupted in the copy), change the defaults.cfg server IP to the new IP of the nic and change the Xitami Service Name, and then start the both sevices from both xitami folders.
 
Can you connect port 80 on both IPs?  Will the second sevice even start up?
 
In the meantime I am checking to see if there are conflicting config files in either of the folders that I am currently using.

I just tried it with 192.168.1.2 port 80 and 192.168.1.18 port 80. I can
start one but not the other. Xitami loads both instances but one doesn't
start even though it says that it's started. I'm not sure what's stopping it
from running tho?  

 

I have 28 IP addresses loaded on this NIC. Virtual sites on one Xitami work
fine. 

 

I don't know maybe I missed something?

In all operating systems, Windows,Linux, Mac Os etc. each server is 
given a port. One server = one port per computer. This means only one 
web server on port 80 no matter how many IP addresses you have. This 
means you must redirect port 80 to each web server this is done by a 
reverse proxy or a name server(DNS). Window NT servers may have a DNS 
but i have not used it. You can down load a free reverse proxy from 
"at32.com".

A reverse proxy can be used to redirect ports on a single computer or 
load balance across a network. So many computers can use the a single 
open port on your router. So you don't have to pin hole each computer on 
yuor router.

Sorry, but this is completely bogus. You can have one webserver on port 
80 per IP address. Provided the software itself isn't utterly broken, 
that is, or lacks the crucial function to bind to a specific IP. Plus, 
the operating system doesn't "give out ports" to applications. Rather, 
the application "claims" a port on a specified interface (which /might/ 
be "all interfaces").

Ok let's analyze this a little. Your PC gets an IP address either static or
dynamic. If you don't have a router then all traffic to that IP address
whether it is Http (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21) or eMail (port
25) ***if memory serves me on my ports*** is sent to your PC. (well even if
you do have a router) You have one port 80, so any traffic is routed to that
port. Even if you set up many IP Addresses bound to that one NIC card you
still only have one Port which is why with one click of a button you can
shut down all web traffic with your firewall software. I have 28 virtual IP
Address on my server however if I shut down port 80 all sites are shut down.
Even though I have 28 IP addresses everything still comes in on the one main
IP address and port 231.123.234:80. When you type myfakewebsite.com a domain
name server somewhere will translate it to my IP address. Notice that it
already has port 80 which is assumed (meaning you don't have to type that
in) with http. Now once that web address (URL) is at the PC it's up to the
software (Web Server) to figure out what to do with it. Now how am I able to
use 28 IP Addresses? I run DNS server software on the same PC as my Web
Server which does nothing with Ports it just translates a domain name to an
IP address. Only one IP address is PUBLIC all the rest are PRIVATE. The only
way I could see more than one port 80 is by having more than one NIC card
and more than one PUBLIC IP Address. Multiple NIC cards Multiple Port 80's. 


Now am I missing something?

Oh boy, where to begin. Firstly, if you have a router, you must forward 
a port in said router to your computer, and /forward it to an IP 
address/. I'm sure you have done this. This should serve as an 
indication that ports are specified /per IP interface/; else, you could 
as well forward it to the adapter's MAC address.

>  You have one port 80, so any traffic is routed to that
> port.

No, you "have" as many ports as you have IP adresses, including the 
several million addresses in the loopback range (127.x.x.x). In fact, 
you better learn that you don't actually "have" ports; don't think of it 
as a "resource", rather, a way to address a specific software that has 
registered to be the recipient of traffic tagged that way.

>  Even if you set up many IP Addresses bound to that one NIC card you

No, you "have" one port per IP address, including the several million IP 
addresses in the loopback range (which you don't have to specify).

That is, of course, because your firewall works that way, and has 
nothing to do with how TCP/IP works.

No, you could configure your web server to listen to a specific IP 
address. I don't know how to do that in Xitami (it's probably possible 
but I can't be bothered to look it up right now), but here's how to do 
it in Apache (including the comment):

**********begin quote**********
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses (0.0.0.0)
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 80
**********begin end**********

Now, the commented line "Listen 12.34.56.78:80" will bind the Apache 
process to a specific address. If you don't bind it to an address, 
however, and use the "Listen 80" line, then it will indeed listen to 
port 80 on all IP addresses bound to the computer, including the 
loopback range. But you have the option to run 28 separate processes 
listening to port 80 on your 28 IP addresses.

Nearly all server level software has the option to bind to a specific IP 
address.

> Now am I missing something?

Actually, without being too blunt, you should really read up on TCP/IP 
on the most basic level before posting more in this thread.

And here is how to do it in the Xitami config file, straight from the 
manual at
http://legacy.imatix.com/html/xitami/index4.htm
Took me two minutes to find.

**********begin quote**********
ipaddress
     Specifies the IP address on which Xitami should open its HTTP 
connection. If this is 0, Xitami will open its connection on all 
available IP addresses. This is normally a Good Idea, since it makes 
configuration much simpler on a multihomed system, and is completely 
correct on a single-homed system (i.e. a system with just one IP 
address, which is pretty common). If you have multiple IP addresses and 
want to run Xitami on just one of these, you can specify it here using 
the standard dotted network address format. This will effectively 
disable IP-based virtual hosting.
     Default: 0 (take any available IP address).

Show me some documentation that says you can have more than one port 80
listening then try running 2 instances of Xitami. I tried it and it didn't
work. 

Port 80 is set in the header of the TCP packet that's true. 

Here
http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=tcp%2Fipport


It says "A number assigned to user sessions and server applications in an IP
network." It doesn't say that each IP address has a port 80 only that is
uses port 80 to communicate with the server software. 

If you have documentation that states otherwise please show me.

Ron

Lol, beautiful. "Show me some documentation". Why not go out and try 
learning something? If you don't believe me OR the Xitami config file 
(!) OR the Apache config file /dealing with how to accomplish this very 
thing/, by all means live in ignorance. If you actually want to learn 
something, PLEASE begin with reading the very simple explanation at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp_port
(which you yourself could have found googling for one second, or just 
trying to search the natural sources of information) and especially try 
to understand this sentence

"Processes implement connections to TCP and UDP ports by means of 
sockets. A socket is a transport end-point, which a process can create

Oh, and by the way, you mention that you didn't manage to get Xitami

doesn't involve Xitami, your computer, or the fundamentals of TCP/IP

there is ONLY one port 80 man!  Per NIC/Router/Linux Box
Man the documentation is right on Xitami's website, or even better buy 
PRO and get the full support, you need it!

Wikipedia was my first stop dude and then the over 100 pages after that and
I did not find one that said there was more than one port 80. And that Wiki
article surely didn't address more than one port 80. And I tried it on my
server it just to see for myself and it didn't work. Tell me you have it
working and how you got it to work and I'll try it on my server and eat crow
if it does.


WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS

The Well Known Ports are assigned by the IANA and on most systems can
only be used by system (or root) processes or by programs executed by
privileged users.

Ports are used in the TCP [RFC793] to name the ends of logical
connections which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of
providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is
defined.  This list specifies the port used by the server process as
its contact port.  The contact port is sometimes called the
"well-known port".

Lol, beautiful. "Show me some documentation". Why not go out and try 
learning something? If you don't believe me OR the Xitami config file 
(!) OR the Apache config file /dealing with how to accomplish this very 
thing/, by all means live in ignorance. If you actually want to learn 
something, PLEASE begin with reading the very simple explanation at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp_port
(which you yourself could have found googling for one second, or just 
trying to search the natural sources of information) and especially try 
to understand this sentence

"Processes implement connections to TCP and UDP ports by means of 
sockets. A socket is a transport end-point, which a process can create 
and then bind to a socket address; in TCP or UDP, a socket address 
consists of a combination of a port and an IP address."

Jesus Criminy - this is entertaining.  Had no idea my questions were going to spur such passionate responses.  

But, in a nutshell - Ports are IP based.  One range of ports per IP address.  So if you have 3 IP addresses on one NIC, then theoretically you have 3X ports available.  And I say 'theoretically' because it depends on how the application is using the IP addresses.  I thought I covered all this in my first response.

However, for those of you who know that TCP Port 80 is per IP address, then please help me understand what I might be doing wrong or where I can look at that is causing a conflict.  In the past, I am pretty confident I had two or three instances of xitami running on Port 80, each on its own IP address (all on the SAME NIC) but can't recall what, if anything, special I did to get it working.  Its been a while.

I have come up with a solution that fixed my original issue of needing a second production server to begin with, however I would still like to move forward with a second server as a test server running on Port 80.  Port 80 is important, and not using some other port, because then my new code can be tested identically to how it would run before making it the production code.  As well, alternate ports other than port 80 can cause some outbound firewall issues that I would rather not deal with.

Config one:
/xitami/defaults.cfg
     * IP : 192.168.20.20
     * Service-Name: Xitami Production Server
     * port:0

/xitamitest/defaults.cfg

     * IP : 192.168.20.30

     * Service-Name: Xitami Test Server

     * port:0

On the test server I even went so far as to copy the xiwinnt.exe file to xiwintest.exe thinking that might help prevent any "service" based conflicts (within Windows 2003 Server).  This did nothing, and the test server would not initialize until I changed it to Port:5080 (or anything other than port 80).  In addition, if I comment out (#Port:0) in the test server, the server service will actually start but nothing will respond on that IP port 80.  

Not certain whats going on but as basic as these configs should be, I believe I may have discovered some kind of compatibility bug between Xitami v2.4d9 and Windows 2003 Server.  I am going to test running multiple copies on Windows XP under the same conditions to test if its a 2003 Server issue.

Comments?

Ron: 

As everyone keeps trying to say, TCP Port 80 is a product of TCP/IP - not a product of 3Com NIC or BroadBand NIC cards.  Its also NOT a product of Windows or MAC or UNIX or a router.  TCP Ports can only exist IF an IP address is present.  Each IP has its own 64,000 range of Ports. 

In Apache: http://modperlbook.org/html/12-1-mod_perl-Deployment-Overview.html

The section that starts with "One Machine, Two IP Addresses"....when they say Machine/Computer, they mean NIC.

I just downloaded the latest package -- it's been a while since I ran 
Xitami, I remember the 2.5 branch version being very buggy. Anyway. I am 
right now running the GUI packages on 127.0.0.4 and 127.0.0.5 as this 
screenshot proves:
http://www.magnuswedberg.com/docs/ohsoyouCANhaveseveralport80duh.jpg
The packages were just unzipped to different directories.
There was a problem though in that the LRWP assignment didn't seem to 
respect the IP setting. Also, it didn't respect that I disabled LRWP. 
Change the LRWP port (and possibly the FTP ports, too) to something 
bizarre (different for each process) and see if that doesn't fix the 
problem, it got them to run perfectly for me.

So what you are saying if I do a port scan on my server with 28 IP addresses
bound to my one NIC card I should see 29 port 80's is that correct? Last
time I checked when I did a port scan I only saw one port 80. Hmmm I wonder
why that is?????  I can't get more than one server to run on port 80 no
matter how many IP addresses I have.  Oh and I'm pretty sure that the Port
is part of the TCP and UDP header not part of the IP Address.  I'll go back
and look at my network training material just to make sure it's been awhile
so I could be wrong.

Ron: 

As everyone keeps trying to say, TCP Port 80 is a product of TCP/IP - not a
product of 3Com NIC or BroadBand NIC cards.  Its also NOT a product of
Windows or MAC or UNIX or a router.  TCP Ports can only exist IF an IP
address is present.  Each IP has its own 64,000 range of Ports. 

In Apache:

The section that starts with "One Machine, Two IP Addresses"....when they
say Machine/Computer, they mean NIC.

Yes, it did, but you didn't understand it. Important distinction. I 
actually quoted the relevant part, you still didn't understand it. 
Google "TCP socket". Then read hit after hit until you understand.

> And I tried it on my server it just to see for myself and it didn't work.

Once again, I'm sure that's not the fault of the fundamentals of TCP/IP. 
Perhaps the fact that I got it to work in less than five minutes, after 
not running Xitami at all for maybe three years, should tell you 
something about our respective amounts of knowledge.

Download the zip. Unzip in two different directories. Edit the 
defaults.cfg so IP is different (for example, 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.0.2). 
Start the two servers. Does it work? If yes, great. If no, change LRWP 
and FTP port assignment to something different for each process. Start 
again. Now it works. Verify by editing the web pages.

It was very, very, very simple.

Yes, if you scan an IP /range/. You don't scan an adapter; in fact, it 
doesn't matter (for TCP/IP, in this context) if you have 28 NICs with 
one IP each or one NIC with 28 IPs. It's the same thing. You try to 
connect to a TCP socket (which is an IP/port combination, which an 
application is listening to) and you look for a response. So:

192.168.0.1:80
192.168.0.2:80
192.168.0.3:80
192.168.0.4:80
...etc...
192.168.0.28:80

...and there you have your 28 port 80s.

Magnus:

Thanks for the tips, I will try those options/settings.  I know its been something that I have missed but simply couldn't put my finger on it.  Thanks.

You can't just disable LRWP, as I wrote. You must change the port number 
(810 for one, 820 for the other, for example). This seems to be a bug in 
Xitami. Also, naturally, both IP addresses (.1 and .28) must be 
registered with that system.

if it still doesn't work, post logs/console.log

Great!

for anyone interested, here are the two defaults.cfg I used, just put 
one in each directory and off you go at 127.0.0.4 and 127.0.0.5:

http://www.magnuswedberg.com/docs/defaults1.cfg
http://www.magnuswedberg.com/docs/defaults2.cfg

(so I could have posted that earlier :-P )

Here's some sloppy thinking from someone who knew the ARPAnet, drifted 
away, and on return had to learn this newfangled TCP stuff.

 > You have one port 80

IP is street address.

Port is a box at that address.

Clearly you can have 1234 Oak St Box 80, and 1235 Oak St Box 80, without 
mix-up. 192.168.1.100:80 and 192.168.1.101:80 are -different- logical 
places, even if they are same physical card in same machine.

What RO was trying -SHOULD- work.

Well, maybe. I'm constantly getting mail for "141" in other 
buildings/streets. My mailman does not always get it right.

Hierarchical addressing systems are easy to screw-up. Mailman sorts 
right only 99% of the time. If you are building a machine, it is easy to 
overlook something, get it 99% right. If it screws-up only in unusual 
situations, it may go unnoticed for a decade.

If this were Mac O/S 7, or Win 311, I'd bet on the tossed-together 
non-unix TCP stacks of that vintage. But W2K+ stole a unix stack and 
should do the right thing.

Magnus has magnanimously traced the conflict. Xitami opens a lot more 
ports than just 80. My reading is that some of these are opened without 
specifying an IP. The default is "all", the first copy already snagged 
those ports, the request is refused, Xitami suspends itself.

Is it a bug? Since you CAN run MANY different IP addresses on a single 
copy of Xitami, demanding to be able to run two copies seems greedy. 
(Specially for free.)

Yet clearly there is IP:Port support; just somehow not on the LRWP 
frill. Probably an oversight by the developer. Well, it IS a technology 
demo, not promised to be all things to all people. And it appears the 
community didn't notice this oddity for many years; how "essential" can 
it be?

Xitami NT-Service source code IS available. And it is darn clean stuff. 
Knowing the bug location, any half-fast C programmer should be able to 
find the function call and the oversight. (Or, since "nobody" uses LRWP, 
simply lose the whole LRWP call.)

Nearly a decade ago, I was able to build Xitami from source. I'm not so 
clever anymore, or I've grown smart enough to have lost all my MS-C 
compiler disks.  I'm a user, not a coder. Do we have any coders here, or 
just users? And coders who want to spend time on this odd-horse problem?

I think the xitami.wikidot.com site says it all. There are NO edits, 
ever, not even the glaring typo in Pieter's introduction ("not" for 
"now"). I just fixed that, and added Magnus's comments.... but 45 days 
with __NO__ community input means nobody has an oar in the water.

Subject: [Xitami] Multi server issue
In-Reply-To: <47E9879F.2030104@geeksgalore.ca>
Message-ID: <000001c88ed0$a44842c0$0400a8c0@NEC>

I used to use xitami, and had multiple servers. It was a while back but I
think I used the multiple IP approach so that anyone not knowing fine
details of my setup could use ordinary browser commands.

1. you can set xitami to listen on ports other than 80 in defaults.cfg
   ipaddress=*

#   Defines the IP port base for the server. Add 80 to this to
#   calculate the actual port used for the HTTP service. For example,
#   to run the server on port 6080, define portbase as 6000. We use a
#   portbase in place of an absolute address so that multiple
#   protocols (e.g. the FTP server embedded into Xitami) can be
#   managed as one unit.

2. but there is only one port x, whatever webserver or other app you have
told to listen on port x, and whatever port x you have chosen. I have not
been reading all the posts but I suspect that what the user is trying to do,
is better done by setting up virtual servers also in defaults.cfg

[Redirect]

#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   VIRTUAL-HOSTS configuration section
#
#   This section lets you define virtual hosts. A virtual host can be
#   specified in two ways: by IP address (if your system has multiple
#   IP addresses) or by name (if your system has multiple names). To
#   define a virtual host, specify the virtual IP address or host name
#   and the name of a configuration file .

[Virtual-Hosts]

#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   FILTER configuration section
#
#   This section lets you define filter programs. To define a filter,
#   specify a file extension with a leading dot and the filter
#   command. The command may be with a full path, or without, if the
#   program is on the PATH.

3. before anyone tells me that there is no defaults.cfg in their
distribution, I know that. You create it yourself to override the settings
in xitami.cfg - if you have ever bothered to read the docs. (it took me 2
minutes to download xitami again and remind myself)

4. Guess what - if you have the server running on a port other than the
standard 80, a remote browser has no way of knowing it automatically.  To
access the server you have to call up the page with the port specified e.g.
http://my.server.com:x

That being said, while xitami suited my purpose for a while, there were some
facilities I wanted (or some problem with one of my favorite tools) that
caused me to switch. The server I use now has a nicely presented web admin
(and guess what for admin you call it using the different admin port!) that
more or less leads you through without looking up the documentation. Web
searches are good.

Apologies if reading only the last couple of posts I misunderstood where the
questioner was coming from.

After all the talk of the wikidot and the new searchable forum thing (about 
3 or 4 months ago) I hadn't heard any more stuff.  I honestly didn't know it 
was up and running.  I will go check it all this week and lend what little 
relevance I have to the situation.  :-P

Will try the lwrp/ftp port changing thing tomorrow and will post the 
results.

So, I just checked out the xitami.wikidot.com page - very cool.  Wasn't there going to be a email archive program to be used that was going to parse through all the email archives and re-organize everything into a searchable database?  At the whole time of the discussion of wikidot I thought the mail was going to be converted too?

Is the conversion live?  Meaning we continue to email to the list, and all new emails remain on the List Archive but are also simultaneously imported into the converted database?  Can't recall how it was too work and since I can't search the archive easily I found it too troublesome to weed through all the threads to find those original emails to see if the answer was in there.

:-)

Also, I still vote for a Xitami to be picked up and development continued again.  Unfortunately, I am not a C programer - if I were I would have been contributing long ago.  But what I am more than willing to do is contribute time and $$$ since I am unable to contribute skills.  I just love Xitami too much to see it whither away into nothingness.

Maybe my contribution could be a new web admin interface and continued documentation?  Just thinking out loud.

Message-ID: <c72.2bc57442.351c0a2a@aol.com>

With fear and trepidation this beginner / hobbyist posts a  question.   
 
I have installed xitami 2.4 stable on a windows xp box behind a router  on a 
static IP address.   
 
I have copied my webpage to the folder.   when I view the  webpage from local 
it worked fine.  I can only pull it up once. 
If you exit the page I cannot pull it up  again.   ,   If you terminate or 
suspend the  server and then restart it works again just  once.      
 
When I went to the Xitami help,   that page would not come up for  me to 
search.   
 
does this sound like a setting that I have not found? 
 
Thanks. 
 
ps is there a new help area where I can look up answers myself?

You haven't provided too much info and based on the description it sounds as if you might have some kind of service or port conflict.  Its an odd sounding problem.  whats the exact version of Xitami you have?

You will probably need to supply more info about your xitami setup, ip/router setup and xp services.  The description, the odd, is also vague.

The problem is that there are actively maintained alternatives out 
there. Apache is much more full featured, much less buggy, runs PHP as a 
module, and it's not even that slow anymore (although nowhere near 
Xitami for static content). And there is Lighttpd, which is a project 
with the same goals as originally Xitami, but still developed, with a 
broader userbase /and/ extreme performance.

In all fairness, Xitami is better in some respects than both these 
products, especially regarding the built-in and quite usable web admin 
interface. But it has never been "in style", and I don't see that 
happening without a couple of high-profile sites adopting it. Which 
won't happen, because it's not actively maintained. You see where this 
is going :-(

*sniff* don't be such a hater.  ;-)

I have been using Xitami for damn nearly a decade now.   I have run it on all Windows platforms since Windows 95 and it has yet to fail me once.  I hear what you're saying but I would just love to see Xitami get off the ground again.  It hasn't been changed or updated in how many years?  7? 8?  And it still kicks ass and serves all of my needs and is lightning fast - just imagine if it was even loosely maintained. 

Was just hoping there were some other sentimental blokes like myself who would want to make the effort.

Same here, although I stopped running it a couple of years ago, because 
I needed better PHP performance on my (then) slow server (the time to 
start PHP as a CGI process is very noticeable) and could trade with the 
much bigger memory footprint of Apache. BUT before THAT, Xitami replaced 
my previous Netscape FastTrack webserver, which it completely trounced 
in every respect. And the Netscape servers were state of the art then 
back in the days.

yeah, especially if it could be really stable with ISAPI (or the like) 
it would be a force to be reckoned with, still.
