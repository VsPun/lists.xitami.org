&gt;<i> Did any of you, try the iASP support on Xitami?
</I>
I tried an ASP-lookalike product about two years ago: cannot currently
remember the name, but still have the files at my place of work.  It may
have been iASP (is that &quot;Instant ASP&quot;, from some company with something
to do with honey or bees in its name?)

&gt;<i> Cause I`ve got a little problem. And wanted to ask about it
</I>
We had to give up on it, because the VB support therein did not support
many of the objects and methods that are second-nature to &quot;normal&quot; ASP
&quot;constructions&quot;.  Pity really, because we would have liked our students
NOT to have had to associate with M$ IIS.

In particular, IIRC, there was no Session object, which makes life a
teensy bit difficult.

As someone else has already asked, please do not post in both ASCII and
HTML.  You need to go into your mailer's settings and select &quot;Send plain
text only&quot;.  Most people (especially those on LISTSERVs) will thank you
for it.

    &quot;We can no longer stand apart from Europe if we would.  Yet we are
    untrained to mix with our neighbours, or even talk to them&quot;.
