<PRE>As Pink Floyd &quot;hey you!&quot;

I`m aware now that either I missed the point or this is another kind of
list.

While I post my opinion or best guess, trying to give any help, you take my
mail, anal ize it and then write a detailed answer, that is supposed to
help... WHO? ME?

About the unsecurity of the SOCKETS you SOCKs with, I don`t quiet understand
how they will manage to be used as spam bridges behind a decent firewall.

Besides the answer was already given, that who was asking, can probably
manage quiet well this security issues.

So please stop posting this kind of  mail. If you want to test somebodys
patience, try to write to me personaly.

For me this discussion ends here, I don´t have the time to read more of your
posts, and less time to do your funny job that aparently looks for reasons
to laugh at the others good will.

Carlos

PS: Sockets and socks is my fault.
SORRY
 I speak spanish but know where to find the ones and the others and manage
quiet well with them.
 If one has to be so critical, can probably show some respect in the way of
pointing faults. No need to offend
Like :  open sockets are used in A..x proxy and CAN be used in spam
bussisnes.
           open socks gives acces to critical parts of kernel, making
possible to make flows of packets against other victim resulting in  denial
of service.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Then you can use a little Proxy as ANALOGX `s to acces the internet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Big warning to anyone thinking of using AnalogX proxy: at one time,
</I>this
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; was distributed such that the default configuration would allow an
</I>open
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; SOCKS proxy; many people have found to their cost that their computer
</I>was
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; being hijacked to relay spam/UCE by news and e-mail --- the first they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would know was when their ISP would cut them off for misusing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; service.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; About the proxy, you can choose to use the sockets or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sigh!  You seem to be in some difficulty in understanding Internet
</I>&gt;<i> terminology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SOCKS != sockets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The AnalogX product, inter alia, provides an open SOCKS proxy.  Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> connecting to this on the appropriate port can use the proxied machine to
</I>&gt;<i> post spam.  The spam is then relayed via the owner's usual ISP's servers
</I>&gt;<i> as if originating from him/her.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AnalogX is *dangerous* in the hands of the uninitiated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly it CAN be configired so as not to have the open SOCKS proxy;
</I>&gt;<i> however, the great majority of Windows users would probably have no idea
</I>&gt;<i> whether they wanted SOCKS or not, and quite likely leave the system with
</I>&gt;<i> the default configuration.  Since the product as originally distributed
</I>&gt;<i> left this dangerous option switched on by default, I felt it necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> remind potential users not to accpe the default without further thought.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then you use it behind the firewall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What?  Something like ZoneAlarm (which is also dangerous in the hands of
</I>&gt;<i> most of its users, although usually only to the extent of worrying them
</I>&gt;<i> through reporting false positives)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 99% of &quot;home Windows systems&quot; that are equipped with a &quot;firewall&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> really using a chocolate fireguard, if they hope for the firewall to run
</I>&gt;<i> on the same machine that is supposedly being &quot;protected&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At last you can get a very good tool from <A HREF="http://grc.com">http://grc.com</A> wich can close
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; infamous sockets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, SOCKS != sockets.
