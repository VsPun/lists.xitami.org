<PRE>I have a question that I hope you all can solve...
 
Running Xitami 2.4d9 on NT4, PHP 4.0.3 and a webmail app which runs currently under webpages\IlohaMail\source.
 
Here's the problem:
 
If I add an alias of &quot;Webmail&quot; to c:\progra~1\xitami\webpages\Ilohamail\source&quot; I get a blank page with no header, etc.  Just a blank page.  Not even a 404, no errors logged in logfile.  Contents of the blank page are: 
 
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;META http-equiv=Content-Type content=&quot;text/html; charset=windows-1252&quot;&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;

Also, the same thing happens when I set the alias to the C:\Ilohamail\source and have a copy of it there instead.
 
If I type in the &quot;index.php&quot; I get the text contents of the PHP file (treating it as text).  If I add an Index.html to the folder, it pops up.  Unfortunately index.php is what I need.  When I reference the directory as <A HREF="http://servername/IlohaMail/source">http://servername/IlohaMail/source</A> I get my perfectly functioning webmail program (when it is a subset of the webpages folder).  However, the way this thing works is there are some config folders I don't want people monkeying around with located under IlohaMail, not just the &quot;source&quot; folder.
 
I have the proper alias setup, I also have the MIME type setup.
 
I installed the XiFusion wrapper (2.6) and the same, nothing.  My direct link still works, but my &quot;webmail&quot; link does not (which currently references the c:/progra~1/xitami/webpages/IlohaMail/source folder).
 
Basically the Alias only seems to work with HTML files, or there is some issue with the PHP, which works for everything else.  I have tried basic PHP files and they all provide the same result.  As if they weren't being called at all.
 
Anybody had experience with this?
 
I am fairly new to PHP so this might be an issue.  But I followed every suggestion on PHP.NET and it does work, just not with Aliases - which leads me to be suspicious...
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Michael Morris
