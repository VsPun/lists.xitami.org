<PRE>I have multiple virtual domains setup on my server.  The default domain is  
my personal domain and I (obviously) have given that domain FULL admin 
access to the server.  When I setup virtual domains I am trying to setup and 
admin account that will allow the admin to ONLY administer that particular 
domain.  However, I am finding that each virtual domain administrator has 
access to everything for ALL domains.

I can't seem to get a fix for this.  Because when I think I am editing 
something for the virtual domain admin account it is actually affecting 
every account (and server config) for all domains.

Xitami provides the following admin settings, could someone shed some light 
on my above problem and also help define the following settings for me:

Allow web-based admin: ___
IP address Mask: _________________
Superuser Password: ____________

How can I prevent the admin of a virtual domain from seeing all the other 
virtual domains - because as of now, if I allow a vitutal admin account 
acess to the server it is putting that admin at the &quot;root&quot; of the server.  
That admin of that virtual domain has access to all configs for all domains. 
  This is not good.  The superuser password implies that if one is defined, 
then that account (or virtual domain administrator) has access to the rest 
of the server, but that is happending anyway.

Thanx in advance.
