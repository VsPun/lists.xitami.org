&gt;<i> I have had several xitami crashes on a pentium 133 running win2000. Of
</I>&gt;<i> cource, knowing that the system was probably too slow, I upgraded to an
</I>AMD
&gt;<i> 550 and the crashes don't happen several times a day, but about once a
</I>week.
&gt;<i> I have a friend who has a pentium 3 450 who says he has crashes every day,
</I>&gt;<i> and he is changing to the apatchi software. is there anything that can be
</I>&gt;<i> done to minimize crashes under win2k?
</I>
========&gt; excuse me for butting in, but i had to comment on this particular
post.
a friend of mine and i both started running xitami at the same time.
installed it the same day and everything. he's running win2k on an 800mhz
machine with 512/ram, and running xitami in 'normal' mode.

i'm running xitami on an old 400mhz machine, running 98se, with 128/ram, and
running it in 'turbo' mode.

he has had nothing but trouble ever-since his install. constant crashes,
bsod, and many other problems.

i, on the other hand, have not had any trouble whatsoever. my server's very
busy, and he's so mad because everything we do, mine always runs better than
his.

now, personally, i think it's that great-big-overblown-'o/s', otherwise
known as win2k.
i've run win2k before on a very nice system, and i couldn't get along with
it. it's way too cumbersome, and it takes about three times as long to do
anything i can do in seconds on 98se.

i've had people tell me that win2k, me, or xp, is the best thing they've
ever used.  these are people who know nothing about computers, and/or just
love 'purdy'..

i don't do 'purdy'.  as far as i'm concerned, a computer is for work-related
stuff, and i don't have time to sit and wait for 'purdies' to load up just
so people can oooh and ahhh at my screen, background, etc.

if you're running a server, or in my case, a few servers, and all on the
aforementioned system, i recommend you turn off all the purdies and run it
'bland'.  because one thing i learned a long time ago. you can't have the
best of both worlds when it comes to windoze. those worlds are only created
by apple. so if that's what you want, buy a mac. (i love my macs)..

oh and one more thing.. for those who think xp NEVER crashes, and is SO much
better than their previous o/s.  i beg to differ on that too.  xp crashes
more than any other o/s microsloth has ever created.  BUT.. when it crashes,
it's doing it in the background where you cannot see it.  i know, i
beta-tested xp, and i wouldn't run it if it was the last o/s on earth.

two things to remember;
1. any computer sold with a 'restore' cd is a pos from the git-go. if they
already know you're going to need to 'restore',
aka-destroy-all-your-files-and-start-from-scratch, they also know they've
built junk.
2. any operating system which uses half your harddrive for 'restore' files,
is total and complete trash. nuff said...
