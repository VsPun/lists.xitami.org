I have tried to set up virtual hosts based on the info from the TZO site.

1. Can someone give me a list of setup instructions
2. Also some instructions on how to call a virtual host from the IE address

Subject: [Xitami] xitami flash bug
Message-ID: <03c101c38d18$5c6cc6b0$0200000a@mariana1>

Hi all:

trying the new version of xitami 2.4R10, that solves the latest issue, I
find something rather dissapointing.

When I build a page in Flash 4, 5 or MX, and make a progress bar that shows
how much you are downloading, the counter stops always at the same place.
And then nothing happens.
I´m not getting any error on the local network, but from the outside it
happens.
All other pages without flash and with flash but without the progress
scripts are OK.

These pages where functioning before, but I made a new one anyway, and the
result was the same.

I also have a tiny script that measures bandwith from my server to the
client and uses PHP and that one went crazy showing extrange caracters...

I´m not an expert with Xitami, but I solved the problem going back to
version 2.4 R9

The error log shows these:

2003/10/07 17:41:47: smthttp: error on socket 224:
2003/10/07 17:42:43: smthttp: error on socket 232:
2003/10/07 17:43:56: smthttp: error on socket 244:

I hope someone could see at the problem, cause we know that 2.4 R9 is buggy
too..

sincerely:

Carlos

I am assuming you are talking about in the linux version.  The best way
would be to telnet/ssh into the box, cd to the file, and do the chmod.  I
know that some ftp programs allow you to do a chmod from them also.  If you
are not sure what chmod does or how to do it then just telnet/ssh into the
linux bow and do a man chmod.

Right now I have 15 sites on this PC. I am running Xitami on Win2k pro and I
have the need to add another drive or another win2k machine. Can Xitami be
configured to point to sites on different drives or machines? And is there
something that tells me how to do that? Suggestions.

site1.com on pc1 f:/drive
site2.com on pc1 g:/drive
site3.com on pc2 d:/drive

My answer works for both local and internet machines.  This chmod command is
for linux servers.  Maybe you need to do a google search on chmod and learn
more about what this command does.

Use the UNC path to the machine.
On server2, make the directory shared as dir2

Set the path to the directory as \\server2\dir2

Works like a charm.

Yeah, that is what is not working. I can map to the share but the UNC isn't
working when entered into the cfg.

added note: I can enter the UNC into my browser and can see the index.htm
file (not as a webpage of course) ie:
\\server2\websites\site1\

in site1.cfg I have:

webpages = "\\server2\websites\site1\"

and of course I restart Xitmai, Nothing (Page not found)
Pointing it to any local drive works fine. like this webpages =
"d:/websites/site1/"
But the UNC for server2 just doesn't work. It's shared, I can map to it, and
I see the files. I just can't get Xitami to use the UNC.

I'm open to ideas folks.

you've got the wrong syntax in your config file. i use mapped drives and it
works fine (never tried a unc in the config file). here is an example from
one of my config files.... you need forward slashes (/) not backslashes (\).


    /cam=m:/xitami/webpages/cam

Are you on a win NT/2k?
Xitami runs as a LOCAL SERVICE and can't access remote drives.

You should create a separate user that has access to network resources and 
run xitami as that user.

Forward and backward slashed and mapped drives work as expected.

Yes win2k running as a service. I'm not sure I understand you second
suggestion. I have access to all network resources. I thought your other
message said to use UNC. What makes a diff between a user that has access to
network resources or Administrator with access to network resources?

I am a bit confused now.

Hello !

In windows, a service runs normally as "LOCAL SERVICE".
This default user has access to all local resources, like printers and drives.
However, it has no access to network resources.

On your w2k server, locate the Xitami service 
(start/programs/administrative tools/services), it's at the end.
DoubleClick on it, select the second tab ("log on"). There you have 
probably "local system account" checked.
Click "this account" and enter the parameters for a valid user (with password).
Restart the service, and it will work.

Marc

Subject: [Xitami] Problem with NSLOOKUP
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.2.20031011143528.00a74b70@verfaillie4.verfaillie.local>

Hello !

I have a strange problem with NSLOOKUP on a win2k server.

When i call nslookup from the command prompt, it works fine.
It works also fine when inside a batch script (writing it's output to a 
file or to the console screen).

When i call nslookup from a program that is called by Xitami (cgi-bin 
application), i always get the error "Default Server: UnKnown".
Same sort of error with another utility that also performs lookups ("no 
data"), so i think the problem is Xitami-related. (Xitami has the correct 
NT rights)

Is this a known error or is there a workaround?
I want to do a MX lookup on a domain to determine if a e-mail address is valid
(are they other alternatives than nslookup for performing a MX lookup? 
-could be a API call to some dll)

Marc

The environment variable "SystemRoot" has to exist (with valid information)
during program startup in order for socket calls to work under NT/2000/XP.
I discovered this oddity when developing the CGI Remote Module for the
ProtoNova Web Server.

This happens when programs are started from an NT service.  So, if you run
Xitami from the console or use the GUI version, your socket-based programs
should work just fine.

Hope this helps!

Indeed a very strange problem. I was trying to solve this problem for 10 
hours now.

I have developped quite a number of applications using Xitami, and for me 
it's the most easy method to implement a multi-user, multi-client 
application. Basically i know what is possible, and stick to it.
The last one is a complete POS (point-Of-Sales) application using touch 
screens and a full screen version of internet explorer.
Everything works fine (even with an outdated webserver).

The only problem was the part involving a real-time name lookup of a email 
address.
When the salespeople enter a e-mail address, it is required to have a email 
validation feature.
The normal way involves sending a automated e-mail to the customer, but 
when the salesperson receives the (negative) response, the customer has 
already leaved, and we have no way of contacting him.

I've tried out other webservers (Apache and Sambar), but Xitami is the most 
easy to configure.
btw Sambar has a very good documentation (but Xitami too)

Subject: [Xitami] Admin Problems
Message-ID: <Law15-F58fpGtS79AX700010c28@hotmail.com>

Anyone experience this problem before.  I set a Username/Password for the 
/admin URI in the "blahdoamin.aut" file of: Username: Test    Password: 
hello

And then when I go to: "www.blahdomain.com/admin" I get the 
Username/Password prompt for that Virtual Domain.  I enter in: Test/hello 
and it gives me access to the FULL server.  Its only supposed to give me 
access to the settings for virtual domain "blahdomain.com"


Settings for "blahdomain.aut" :
URI or partial URI:       Translated path:                           IP 
address mask:       Auth realm:      Users:
/admin                      /xitami/blahdomain/htdocs/admin                  
                                             1

User 1:  Username=Test        Password=hello

In summary, a local Username/Password specific to a virtualdomain 
authentication file allows access to the full server.

Subject: [Xitami] xitami: lwrp bug
Message-ID: <01C3926D.BE85DBC0.sala.massimo@mecmatica.it>

Hi

I am a happy user of Xitami, under Windows 2000.

Now I am trying Xitami 2.5c0, under Windows 2000 Pro Service Pack 4.

In my defaults.cfg file, I set
[Lrwp]
enabled=0

It doesn't work: Xitami starts, lwrp port (81) is still open and owned by Xitami.



Best regards, Sala Massimo

Message-ID: <5.1.1.5.2.20031016015250.00b3b468@hecky.it.northwestern.edu>

Hi,
I'm using the Stable Release 2.4d10 version of Xitami with Windows XP 
Professional.
The error message I get is this:
Xitami was suspended
Could not open HTTP port 80 - Protocol not known (No error).
I get this message whenever I open the xigui32 application, as well as 
whenever I click on the 'start' button in the xitami program itself.
I got the following info from a file called 'console' in the logs folder, 
if it helps at all:
2003/10/16 01:48:02: xilrwp: Could not open LRWP port 81
2003/10/16 01:48:02: Protocol not known

2003/10/16 01:48:02: smthttp: closing HTTP connections on port 80.
This problem also occurred with Current Release 2.5c0.
Any suggestions for how to fix this?
Thanks,

Hi, my Linux system is going down because I have to much log-files. Why 
does this not work?

[Accesslog]
  Filename = "familie-ney_de_access.log"
  Cycle-how = concat
  Cycle-arg = familie-ney_de_access.archive
  Format = CLFX

It seems that the log-files isn't concatenated to the achive.

Has anyone tried to disable sslv2 in xitami pro? I'm running 2.4d10 and
I can't seem to get it to completely disable sslv2
I've tried setting protocol=3Dsslv3 in my sslhttp.cfs file but that
doesn't seem to work, I can still connect using sslv2 and IE
With sslv2 as the only protocol enabled in Opera I can't connect using
https; however same setup and IE it will connect just fine and I see
this in the debug.log "Connection: SSLv2: RC4-MD5, none"
Anyone have any ideas on what I'm missing?

Thanks!

Hi,

We have upgraded to new mail server software on the system which hosts
the Xitami mailing list.  We believe that everything has migrated over
correctly, and the Xitami mailing list should be working just as it was
before.

However if anyone notices any new problems with sending mail to the
Xitami mailing list please let me know directly (<ewen@imatix.com>).

Thanks,

You have to disable certain cryptography options at compile-time with
OpenSSL to disable those algorithms.  There are special sections of code in
OpenSSL that handle IE.  You have to disable those IE options, but then IE
may or may not work with a server not using the workarounds for bugs in IE.

Hope this helps!

Okay, I think we can conclude from the several test messages that people
have sent (including my cunningly disguised one :-) ), that it's all 
still working.

No more test messages thanks.  (But of course you're still welcome to
let me know directly if there is some problem with on-topic messages
you're trying to send.)

Subject: [Xitami] Sending POST requests to directory, not files
Message-ID: <JA8AAAAAAQmY4gABYQABj6DB09hU@proteusworld.com>

Hello,

In other web servers (e.g. Apache) it is possible to have forms like:

<form action="/somedir" method="post">

However, Xitami doesn't seem to like this behaviour, it expects to have 
a file in "action", even though I specified in defaults.cfg:

default3=index.php

Is thre any way to change this behaviour? I have a rather big PHP 
application develop by a 3rd party and going through all the files
to modify the <form> tags is not really something I would look
forward.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Sebastian

Sorry to bother everyone.

Someone, who connects to pol.co.uk (an ISP in the United Kingdom), has 
taken to bouncing all the messages from the Xitami list back to me with
a forged bounce message claiming they are from postmaster@lists.xitami.org.

Received: from modem-4025.dasyure.dialup.pol.co.uk ([81.78.63.185] helo=lists.xitami.org)
        by tmailb1.svr.pol.co.uk with esmtp (Exim 4.14)
        id 1ACEkX-0004J8-Kg
        for xitami-admin@lists.xitami.org; Wed, 22 Oct 2003 09:53:49 +0100

I'm assuming this means that they don't want to be on the mailing list
any more.

However the bounce messages are worse than useless as they contain no
indication of which account the messages were delivered to, no headers
from the original message, and there are no users on the Xitami mailing
list using a pol.co.uk email address.

Perhaps someone can help me identify what email address the mail is being
delivered to, and then I can remove them from the mailing list, and 
everyone can be happy.

Failing that I'll have to complain to the abuse department at pol.co.uk
and see if they can either identify the user (eg, from the IP address
they were assigned at the time) or ask them to stop doing so.

People: if you don't want to get messages on the Xitami mailing list,
which you subscribed to, please unsubscribe.  If you can't figure out how,
then email me directly (<ewen@imatix.com>) and I'll do it for you.

Message-ID: <715379D39F6E534594B4B3182B63659004BB7034@fangorn.cc.vt.edu>

Yeah I've seen the OpenSSL options and the one I want to implement is
NO_SSLv2.
But with Xitami Pro (on Windows anyway) has OpenSSL compiled into the
executable so how would I tell it to use the NO_SSLv2 option?

It looks like the appropriate place would be the sslhttp.cfs file, but
that doesn't seem to work ... Is there another way? Or any way that I
can do it in that file? Or maybe I'm just out of luck?

Thanks!

You have to disable certain cryptography options at compile-time with
OpenSSL to disable those algorithms.  There are special sections of code
in OpenSSL that handle IE.  You have to disable those IE options, but
then IE may or may not work with a server not using the workarounds for
bugs in IE.

Hope this helps!

Would it be possible to have a Bulletin Board to post Xitami questions to?  
It would benefit the xitami user community in three ways:  1) users wouldn't 
continuously get emails filling up their mail boxes 2) there would be a 
history/record of all posts so people asking questions could do a search on 
their question before asking it and 3) responses to a question can be 
contained within a single post so the answer(s) is part of the recorded 
post.

In a sense, Xitami be building a knowledge base built by its own user

Heck, you could even link the Xitami help files right into the site as an 
additional reference.

pol.co.uk (Planet On-Line) are the ISP arm of Energis (who are, or were,
a telco).  They provide the infrastructure for Freeserve (amongst others)
in all its manifestations.  Doubtless you have subscribers with addresses
of the form someone@somenode.freeserve.co.uk, so@sn.fsnet.co.uk, etc.
(The full list of potential parent domains for the "somenode" is listed
on Freeserve's sign-up web pages.)

It IS an abuse; moreover, such forgery is against Freeserve's AUP (as
will be the case with most if not all ISPs).  How is it that people are
quite so stupid about unsubscribing from mailing lists?

Your request made me realize that perhaps Usenet might be a better
approach.  (1) it's distributed, rather than reliant upon a single server
site; (2) the propagation mechanisms are already there; (3) DejaGoogle
provides an archive and searching mechanism.

So I hunted around to see what sort of groups already exist; I had
expected to see, for example, groups discussing apache.  To my surprise,
althought there were some national groups (in japan.* and dk.*), and also
an alt group, there was nothing in the Big-8 comp.* hierarchy.

ISTM that the correct place would have been in a sub-division of
comp.infosystems.www.server.*; however, the taxonomy of that is by O/S
platform.  Is anyone on this mailing list already active anywhere within
that comp.i.w.s.* hierarchy?

> In a sense, Xitami be building a knowledge base built by its own user=20
> community.

There IS an archive of these mailing list posts: details are in the
headers.

[BTW, _one_ of the annoying aspects of a mailing list is repeated
regurgitation of untrimmed quoted material by those that post their
comments at the top.  Much unnecessary volume could be cut from this
present list if all posters learnt how to formulate replies properly.

50 unnecessarily quoted lines snipped :-( ]

I guess it's been over a year since we last went around this circle; and
in that time there've been even fewer people using the Xitami support
maliing list.

FWIW:
- there is some talk inside iMatix of setting up a web forum for support
  of various products (including Xitami); I'll prod some people and see
  if anything happens

- Mailman (the mailing list software we use) includes support for gating
  to/from Usenet; so we could do that

- If we wanted a "real" Usenet group (ie, likely to be carried on lots
  of servers around the world) someone would need to do the work to
  persuade people it should be created -- with less than 500 subscribers
  to the Xitami mailing list (including inactive ones) that might be
  hard work.  We could host a imatix.* Usenet hierachy, but it wouldn't
  get the same advantages people normally associate with Usenet.

>There IS an archive of these mailing list posts: details are in the headers.

Well, I think it's a great idea, no matter how its done.  Though, I do have 
one comment about Usenet: there are many users that are new to the web who 
are trying to configure xitami for the first time, getting them to 
understand and for them to get to Usenet could be problematic for them.   
Keeping it to a iMatix or xitami.com site would keep it contained and easily

You are out of luck since iMatix has chosen to not dynamically link OpenSSL
and OpenSSL options have to be specified at compile time.  If iMatix had
dynamically linked XiPro, they could have used the Win32 OpenSSL
Installation Project and avoided this issue altogether.

You can always try asking for a special build that uses either dynamic
linking or no SSL v2 support.

Hope this helps!

Well, Ron Ackerman has been the first volunteer to help create a bulletin
board.  I would offer to do it but I pay to have my server online and I
currently have zero revenue to offset that cost so I can't afford the
additional traffic.  With only 500 users on the Xitami subscription list I
would think getting a Usenet group started would be pointless.

500 users??? thats all!!!?  Man, I have been using Xitami for years now,
first as rolinger@spint.net, then rolinger@earthlink.net then as
rolinger@airpower.net and now as rolinger1@hotmail.com .  I am a faithful
and loyal user.  Always will be.  I just can't imagine the user base being
so small - Xitami is just too good for that.

Ron, you have my vote and support if its not too much trouble to get
started.  Maybe the site could be mirrored to iMatix.

anyone else?

I'm also in favor of a Bulletin Board system, where questions could be 
placed in the right forum: general config, php, cgi, ...
Maybe this would give new life to Xitami.
phpBB seems to be a good choice compared to the more 'basic' ultimate.

Hello Brian,

BHK> regurgitation  of  untrimmed  quoted  material by those that post their
BHK> comments  at  the  top.  Much unnecessary volume could be cut from this

That's got to be a job for the moderators. Reference to posting guidelines.

also

I am subscribed to the list (rarely post partly because of the spam issue...
my  email  address  being  archived)  and much prefer lists to forums on the
whole,  even with the list quirks e.g I have a folder full of unthreaded but
related messages simply because people won't select a message and hit reply.
As  I  view  my  list  mail  in  threaded view it is very irritating to have
orphans  and  broken  threads  all over the place. But you get problems with
forums  as  well.  With forums someone might start a thread and 3 or 4 posts
down  someone else takes the post off of the original topic. If you've got a
thread  with  30  or  40  posts  you could have many side topics all the way
through the one thread. In this respect it is much worse that using lists.

IMO  if  the  mail  archive problem was sorted - that is, if email addresses
were  protected  from  spammers  -  and  the  Xitami  list was promoted on a
complimentary  web  board,  the  list  membership  would  probably gradually
increase.  As  I  said, I prefer lists as they are less time consuming and I
don't have to worry about pages loading and board lag etc.

Thought I'd drop my 10 penneth in. Hope this is OK.

I think imatix people should decide how Xitami
support will be handled. And I trust them to ensure
it is as simple and focused as it has been to date.
Xitami being a small community, the last thing we
need is multiple support group methods scattered
among web forums, mailing lists and newsgroups.

Personally, I would prefer either to stay as a mailing
list, or switch to a single newsgroup (either imatix
hosted or usenet). I Don't like web forums.

Subject: [Xitami] lrwp crash
Message-ID: <Law12-OE67n1bnmFNrI00009ef4@hotmail.com>

I installed xitami v2.5b4 in my pc (winxp pro) and was really
happy after seeing the improvements from 2.4d9(my prev version).

my site needs sokrates servlet runner due to its use of servlets.
unfortunately, unlike the v2.4, this version just mysteriously disconnects
the runner (and xitami itself gets busy and then crashes
with an error or something after terminating it). The crash log of xitami
gets filled up and
even though the runner says it has reconnected to the server,
i can't access the servlet anymore.

another is that, my test servlet which loads a approx. 369 kb page (all
text)
which worked quite fine and dandy during my Xv2.4 days, made the same
error and disconnected the lrwp connections too.

does anyone know this lrwp problem?

For me it seems it's again the filosophy of Xitami.
Xitami is a free webserver, much easier and stable than IIS.
So why put a group on a Micro$soft server?
I just don't like all the M$ stuff they put on their new XP OS: messenger, 
spyware, ...
Creating an account to access such group will flood your mailbox and 
desktop with addware and pop-ups.

It should be a modern BBS maintained by Imatix/Xitami.

I am of the same opinion. Xitami is an independent competing application and
should be treated that way -- and carve out it's own "professional"
existence in the market.

For me it seems it's again the filosophy of Xitami.
Xitami is a free webserver, much easier and stable than IIS.
So why put a group on a Micro$soft server?
I just don't like all the M$ stuff they put on their new XP OS: messenger, 
spyware, ...
Creating an account to access such group will flood your mailbox and 
desktop with addware and pop-ups.

It should be a modern BBS maintained by Imatix/Xitami.

Ok, so you have to deal with some popups! We have to deal with that crap 
anyway, I was mainly focused on it being FREE and that you could have 
multiple group administrators so someone wasn't having to babysit all the 
time and messages would be searchable.

Only a suggestion...

My 2 cents:  If it ain't broke don't fix it. 

The mailing list has worked fine for a number of years.  Everything I 
need to know comes to my email, which I go through at least daily.  
There is no need to remember to go check a bulletin board, which based 
on history, may go days or weeks without any new posts.

 The advantage of Xitami is that it is simple low maintenance server, 
which you can almost install and forget.  The mailing list is generally 
pretty quiet (as it should be), if there were a high volume of problems 
(where a bulletin board was required to meet the information needs) I 
would be looking for a different Web Server.

Okay, this weekend we are in the middle of a server upgrade for InReview.
(www.inreview.com) It should be back up tonight or first thing in the
morning. I have checked with the administrator and we can have an Xitami
area set up in a matter of minutes. Currently, or I should say prior to
upgrade InReview was handeling at any given time 150 to 200+ users online at
any given time with a registration base of over 60,000. So InReview can
handle whatever you throw at it. InReview has 2 administrators, 4 Senior
Moderators, and about 15 Moderators. InReview is one of the best Forums that
I have seen.

Subject: [Xitami] equivalent to .htaccess
Message-ID: <MOELKEOEGFBFNIEMGHEOKEBJCAAA.eatley@wow-corp.com>

Hi all,

Here is what I'm attempting to do. A client is running the Xitami webserver
on an NT machine and wants password protected directories without a
.htaccess-style popup window. Starting at the login page, they will be shown
a form to enter username/password; a PHP file should then read existing
authentication files and then transfer to login.php if authenticated. How
can I, using Xitami's .aut files, set up a PHP page to read these files and
authorize based on info?

Perhaps this is not truly a Xitami issue; I, however, am not entirely
familiar with Xitami's structure (defaults.aut is the file to access,
perhaps?)

Thanks,
Eve

Subject: [Xitami] Bug in HTTP error msg handling? But with "root" change?
Message-ID: <20031027215456.79065.qmail@web40601.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi, fellow Xitami users.

I'm a brand spankin' new user of the Xitami web server
program. After spending about three days surfing for
information about various HTTP server alternatives
(and trying out, but quickly dropping, one of them
other than Xitami), I've been playing with Xitami now
for the last three days.

I've installed the Windows version (i.e., not console,
not NT service) on a Windows XP system, and it is
Xitami v2.5b4 that I'm using.

I will mention these items that I believe are bugs in
the coding. I say that I believe these are bugs,
because I've banged my head against the program quite
a bit and not been able to get it to work the way I
believe it is supposed to following the documentation
- but, of course, I could be wrong and the problems
could simply be due to my own "novicehood" with the
program.

There are three problems that I will bring up here:
(1) Setting the "use-error-script" using the
browser-based configuration screen (for "Errors"), (2)
Use of the defined error messages (e.g.,
"@errors/text-404.htm"), and (3) Changing the web
server "root" from "webpages" to something else.

Here is the problem behavior I have noted:

(1) When you bring up the browser-based Xitami
Administration screen, then click on Configuration,
then click on Errors, there is a check box for "Use
message template script?" I have noted that when I
check this box, and press the save button, that act of
saying "Xitami, I want to use the message template
script" is NOT being saved to the defaults.cfg file.
Of course, there is a manual work-around for this in
that you can simply add the following line to the
[Server] section using your text editor:

   use-error-script = "1"

But this seems to be a clear bug in this version of
Xitami (v2.5b4), with respect to the browser-based
configuration screen (but not with the server itself).

Please note that when I set the use-error-script to
"1" (i.e., turn it on), then the server DOES use the
template file "errors.gsl", as it is supposed to.

(2) The documentation (the Configuration page) states,
and the relevent browser-based Admin screen (Errors)
implies, that Xitami is supposed to use the files such
as "@errors/header.htm", "@errors/text-404.htm", and
"@errors/footer.htm" to report errors (when
"use-error-script" is turned off), but in no case can
I get this to work. For example, with a 404 error, I
simply get the default IE Explorer 404 HTTP error
page. I ever seen the message from the
"@errors/text-404.htm" file. Again, I don't know
whether I'm doing something wrong or if this is a bug
in the program.

(3) I played around a bit with changing the name of
the root directory for the web server, and I
discovered that when I did this, then the server DID
use the specified directory BUT a directory by the
name of "webpages" (the default) still HAD TO exist or
the server would claim that the root directory did not
exist. This seems to me to be a clear bug in the code.

The way I discovered this problem and this behavior is
that I had configured the server (with the "webpages"
parameter in the [Server] section) to use a root
directory named "webroot" and then I directly altered
the name of the original "webpages" directory itself.
Thus, a directory named "webpages" did not exist at
all. The server would then keep telling me that I had
no home page (a 404 error) even though it clearly DID
exist (all I had done was changed the name of the
default root directory to something else and then
pointed to this new name in the configuration file
(defaults.cfg). After trying out all kinds of things
and scratching my head for over an hour I hit on the
idea of creating a directory with the name "webpages"
(with absolutely nothing in it), and - ta da! - the
server worked like a charm, using the "index.html"
file I had in my "webroot" directory.

Has anyone else had these problems? Have these issues
been addressed in a newer version of Xitami? Version
2.5b4 was the latest version that I was able to
download from the website. As I'm working with Xitami,
I'm finding that I like this program, and I would like
to work with anyone I need to to help get the errors
that I notice fixed.

(FYI, FWIW, I've been a programmer since the late
1970s, and I've been using C++ for the last 7 years,
and just recently I've been motivated to dig into
doing some serious CGI programming using C++ and Perl
(and perhaps PHP?) for web applications. I use dial-up
from home, but I need a web server running on my home
computer to provide myself with a test bed. I have
also downloaded MySQL and am in the middle of setting
this up on my home computer. My motivation for this is
that I've been laid off from the company I worked for,
in a serious downsizing, and job prospects have been
bleak, so web apps are something I'm starting to work
on as a possibility of drumming up some home business
income.)

I am currently running Xitami v2.5b4 and I have no problem with yourthird
problem u addressed in this email.  I am also using XP mine is Pro version.
I dont think that shoudl matter though.  I still have yet to try the error
problems you refered to but will try to check in to those to see if the
problems occur for me as well.  When changeing your main HTML directory you
can either enter the complete path to the directory you would like (eg.
c:/webroot/) or if the directoy exists within the Xitami directory you can
directly refer to it (eg. if the desired directory is c:\Xitami\webroot the
Main HTML directory could either be the direct path or ./webroot). I tried
both of these methods and both worked for me.  Hope this helps somewhat.

Sorry, I don't use 2.5x and I have never used browser based
administration anytime therefore I cannot answer your questions about
error scripts.

But this one looks like a _FEATURE_ of MSIE.

Here is a fragment of error message source I have grabbed from one of
akamai.net servers:

<!--

  -- an error's message is "too small", specifically

Message-ID: <1067557587.3fa1a2d3a6d07@imp1-l.free.fr>

Hi everyone this is my first post here, and i am not sure where to begin.

I have tested a couple of home servers recently looking for good reliable and 
secure applications. I have just unistalled "602Pro LAN SUITE 2003" which is 
excellent in its own rights and very very very easy to install and use. Even a 
total newbie to a computor or even the net can get it up and running in less 
than 5 minutes. 
The main reason for the uninstall was to test others before 
buying. xitami is one of the tests. I decided on this test because the 
xitami.org proclaims that its easy to install, lmao. I went throught the 
online help, faq and god only knows what else, to no avail. In fact i came 
across 3 different explanations on the setup on one site.

1st when the application installs under windows, its there you set up the 
password. It doesnt install anything it just unzips with no sign of a password 
setup.

2nd you must change the password etc in the .aut and the.cfg files. Doesnt do 
a thing.

3rd you have to create to new files .aut and .cfg. doesnt do a thing

So then, with all the different ways of doing things which is the correct way, 
oh sorry, you cant answer that because nothing works there is no possible way 
to logon as admin.

I then went on to reading the archives a little, that is when i eventually 
figured out how the damn thing works, to realise there is a possiblity of spam 
mail and god only knows what else. I also read that there is only 500 active 
members. Sorry but thats your own fault. If you get rid of this stupid mailing 
list a put a good forum www.phpbb.com for exapmle (FREE) you will find that 
you will have more members, that can discuss things between themselves, faster 
and maybe help you solve the screwed help system on the site. How can you say 
its easy to setup when you cant explain how to do it? i havent seen one single 
helpfull answer in the archives.

I am looking at testing and eventually buying because i am in the process of 
starting up my own online 3D website creating business. Its up to you guys now 
to get it running if you want the sale. If not dont bother answering and i 
will go back to something that works, as ive cant afford to play around any 
longer.

Thanks in advance and i hope you understand my frustration and anger after 
wasting many hours trying to get something (EASY) to work.

I went to the site to see how it looks and it looks good. But there is one
problem. The site behaves as if it was in some sort of edit mode. Whichever
element I click on it gets the selection nodes and I can move, delete and
even resize those elements by grabbing those nodes, just like in a graphics
application. I am using Mozilla 1.5.

If my description isn't so great then I could email a screenshot to you or
place a picture on a web somewhere


Now, don't take me wrong. I appreciate the site and your effort and I like
the BB. I tried starting one myself (http://members.lycos.co.uk/xitami). But
when I go to a site that acts funny with mozilla I never come back. This is
also true with many other people who prefer a more secure Mozilla browser
than IE.

If this issue is resolved I would send you a all xitami list messages parsed
into a tab delimited format, unless you prefer Firebird database format. I
think that putting the body of the existing information on a BB is critical
to its success.

Thanks.

You are correct, InReview doesn't seem to work well with Mozilla, works
great with Netscape and IE. I have reported it to the Administrator and will
update you with the result.

To get your Mozilla to work with InReview, you need to go to ("Edit" ->
"Preferences" -> "Advanced" -> "HTTP Networking") and click Use HTTP 1.0
then it will work just fine. I'm not sure about Pipelining mine did not have
it enabled.

The forum has to be supported by Imatix, with links pointing to the site.

There are at least two different forums that were started some days ago.
Everybody starting it's own forum won't attract new people.

Hello Xitami,

I've  been  following  the  threads  about starting new Xitami support
forums over the last week, and have noticed an urgency by some to move
away  completle  from  list  support.  I  don't understand the urgency
myself,  but  there you go. So is this list going to be closed=3F If web

Let me put it another way, InReview is probably the best Board/Forum on the
internet. If ya'll decide not to use it that's fine. I will wait until Nov
8th before removing what's there, it's your choice. If you (Xitami) chose
not to use it please let me know. Keep in mind, you will get a lot of
exposure there and the good part, you don't have to maintain it.

I think you've missed the point; a user should NEVER have to change
browser settings so as to be able to access any particular site: rather
the site's designer has a duty to write HTML which works with any
browser.  A browser's settings are supposed to allow the user to express
his/her preferences about presentation[1]: they are NOT there to excuse
the shortcomings of the web site itself.

Besides, making Mozilla use HTTP/1.0 protocols will block access to the
vast majority of other sites nowadays that host multiple virtual servers
at one IP address.

[1] E.g. some people are poorly-sighted, and hence want to override the
site's settings and use large fonts.

Don't you find it odd that the only browser that doesn't work with the site
is Mozilla? The InReview administrator said that he would look into it but
he is not going to jump through hoops for a few Xitami users. Maybe Mozilla
needs to look into their program. As I said there are over 60,000 users
registered to use that site 150 - 200 online at any given time. You do the
math.

Ikonboard I run under Xitami.  I have FTP disabled (running War 
FTP for our FTP service).

(and every other month.)  The URL at the bottom of EVERY mailing list
message points at the list general information page, from where you can
unsubscribe, view the list archives, etc.  One of the options for
viewing each month's archives is "threaded".

I don't have any control over the display of email addresses in the
mailing list archives.  The main place they seem to be displayed is in
the "In message.... writes:" type lines, which were included in the
original messages.

It's not really my place to comment on a web forum (I have suggested to
the iMatix technical staff they might wish to comment on the issue, but
so far they haven't had time), but I will observe that having multiple
support locations will tend to spread the "self help" support thinly.
The most valuable part of any "user support" forum is the number of
users who can say "I remember that issue, and I fixed it like this...".
So one support location is probably better than lots of them.

The problem I have with this is email harvesters.  I have been a victim of
this before on a Linux mail list.  They were just archiving the mail list
and some harvester scanned the archive and got the email address of
everybody on the list.  I am still battling spam from that.  The way the
Linux group fixed it was to send the emails into a program that replaces out
the email in the header before going to the archiving.

A forum can give you the best of both worlds. MUCH better organization,
archiving, and searching. AND, most forum scripts let you "subscribe", so
everything still comes in via email. You never have to visit the forum,
unless you want to make a post. And you can post without giving an email
address.

I am a member of a couple of forums and I find myself just reading the
messages.  If I have to login to answer any questions then I usually just
don't.  So if I have to got a webpage, then login, just to answer a question
then the list will suffer.

Just my $.02

 That's a very good point.  I am also a member of a bunch of automotive =
sites, but only "surf" one of them regularly.  (Check in several times a =
day).  The others I just pop in now and then, mainly to look through =
classifieds. =20

 So when the subject is something that people are mainly only interested =
in when there is a problem and there isn't on going daily discussions, =
an email list does benefit those of us who only have an occasional =
question.
