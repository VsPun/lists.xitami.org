Subject: [Xitami] Load/Stress Testing Xitami
Message-ID: <BAY105-F20096741004175D597BD8DF8E80@phx.gbl>


Has anyone done any real world simulation or testing of Xitami?  I am trying 
to find a good load/stress testing tool (hopefully for free) that will allow 
me to bang the hell out of my server.  Anyone have any recommendations?

I would love to see users results to their stress testing by answering the 
following questions:
1) Hardware processor and memory:
2) OS Level:
3) How many users were simulated:
4) What was the duration of the test:
5) How many HTTP requests sent:
6) HTTP requests, Pass/Fail/No Response:
7) Server memory/processor utlizations during test:
8) Peak Bandwidth usage during test:
9) Summary and Comments about Results:

My first test results, though I don't know if my client was screwing up or 
the server or a combination of both:

1) Hardware processor and memory: 3.2Ghz Pentium 4, 2Gig
2) OS Level: Win Server 2003 - Enterprise
3) How many users were simulated: 2000
4) What was the duration of the test: 10 minutes
5) How many HTTP requests sent: 200,000
6) HTTP requests, Pass/Fail/No Response: 14,985/180,320/4722
7) Server memory/processor utlizations during test: 100% the entire time
8) Peak Bandwidth usage during test: 3% (total 47Mb transferred)
9) Summary and Comments about Results:  The server was slammed, without a 
doubt.  But it took 15,000 active sessions over 10 minutes.  So about 1500 
sessions per minute, 25 per second.  I don't think the "single" client I ran 
it from could produce that kind of load so the 180,000 failures could simply 
have been a big combination client failing AND server failing....not certain 
though.  I would imagine that the server would be able to handle a heck of 
alot more than 25 connections per second.  I am going to try to simulate a 
test from 5 clients spreading the load of 100,000 connections for a 10 
minute test to see if I can get better results.

My server is running Xitami and MySql and EVERY HTTP request requires a 
MySql call to retreive data.  I would love to know how some users tested if 
Xitami and there DB were on two seperate servers.

Hopefully this will generate some discussion, so feel free to add more info 
in beyond what I was looking for.

Russel,

You didn't mention if you are using PHP or some other scripting 
language, but I'm not aware of any method to query a MySQL database 
without one.  Scripting languages under Xitami typically require CGI.

When CGI runs like that, the CPU gets hammered because you've got new 
processes being created left and right.  The system is spending most of 
its time starting up and shutting down processes.

I ran a similar test spread across 15 machines on a LAN once with Xitami 
via CGI and got similar results (I wrote my own tool).  Xitami simply 
couldn't handle the load.  Most of the time it just returned blank 
pages.  I don't know what tool you are using but socket code fails if 
you mass connect to a server in rapid succession (Windows hangs onto 
socket handles until TCP closes down cleanly or times out)...for my 
test, I wrote a tool to manage the process and just retried the 
connection on failure (i.e. it is almost always the client that fails to 
connect because all sockets are in use).  Keep in mind that this test 
was many years ago, so I've forgotten a lot of the details but from what 
you've described, you're running into many of the same issues I ran into.

I do seem to recall the web document root getting flooded with bogus 
files from stdin/stdout.  Search the Xitami archives and there should be 
a warning from me about a DDoS issue with CGI support in Xitami.  I 
remember looking at the source code to CGI support to see how it would 
need to be fixed and something about incorrect filename selection was 
the cause of bogus files and the blank pages (i.e. too many requests in 
too short of a time resulted in lousy/incorrect filename selection). 
Also because the files are in the web root, it is conceivable that 
security is drastically reduced (i.e. someone could remotely gain access 
to passwords/credit card info/etc).

In theory, if you are using PHP, you should be able to drastically 
improve performance and security by using Xitami LRWP, multiple 
instances of the ISAPI LRWP daemon (isapid - probably still a 'beta'), 
and the ISAPI PHP module.  Then, in your PHP code, use persistent 
connections to the MySQL database (i.e. mysql_pconnect()).  LRWP, IMO, 
is a weak protocol - it can only handle one request at a time.  For the 
load you describe, 10-12 instances of the ISAPI LRWP daemon will 
probably be sufficient.  The server will still be hammered but should be 
able to handle the load.

I think your server fails because of the database access. My server can
handle a peak of 25 requests (not connections) per seconds, and it's only a
pentium III 600MHz. 1/4 of the requests are cgi-bin requests.
The requests are local (my router would crash well before attaining that
number).

Since the footprint of Xitami is so small, i suggest you put Xitami on the
MySql server itself and route the requests to the server instead of using
two servers. I don't know how much data is exchanged between sql database
and server, but i don't think it's a good combination.

Doesn't Xitami create an individual Perl process per cgi script being 
called?  If 25 users hit the server at once then that would be 25 perl calls 
with 25 instances Perl.exe running?  How would Apache and IIS handle a 
similar situation?

Using Microsoft Web Application Stress Tool ver1.1 .  Do you recall the load 
it was able to handle?  And is there anyway you could think of to push the 
25 connections per second without moving to PHP?  And doesn't the Xitami PHP 
get handled by the CGI processor so there is no real advantage to moving to 
PHP?

The Client fails to connect because the client sockets are in use or the 
Server sockets are in use?  If its the Server sockets in use, using Win2003 
Server is there away to increase buffers specfically for more web sockets to 
be created ?

When running as a CGI, both Apache and IIS would handle it the same way. 
  However, Perl has both mod_perl (Apache) and Perl for ISAPI (IIS) 
modules available.

I was using PHP as an example.  And, as I said, I don't recall the load 
but it wasn't much.  See below for improvement ideas.

Client sockets are in use.  Haven't run into the issue of running out of 
server sockets before.

The above applies to "Perl for ISAPI" as well.  Apparently ActiveState 
includes a closed source ISAPI filter with their Perl distribution. 
However, as far as I know, Perl doesn't have a mysql_pconnect() 
equivalent - so you'll be hurting performance in the database area.

thank you all very kindly for suggesting the webanalizer.  this is probably
something i'll be looking into for personal use, in the not-so-distant
future.

i was however, hoping to find something that would run on the client-side.
i've been hosting a domain for someone who lives some 3600 miles away, who's
recently enquired about traffic statistics pertaining to his site.  i have
nearly two complete years worth of logs which apply to his domain alone (in
xitami default format), and archived to a series of zip-files... each of
which, covers a seven day span.  he currently has password-protected http
access to his entire log archive... so i was hoping to suggest an
application that might allow him to do all the leg-work and data-processing
on his own time ;)

as it stands, he's a great web-master... but still tends to be a bit
horrified by the sight of a raw access log <lol>.

thanks again

rick

Do you really want to say that you want a /server-side/ web analyzer? 
Because Webalizer /is/ a client-side program. A Windows binary is 
available on the downloads page.

Why don't you just download it and try it out? It's extremely simple to 
use and comes compiled for any platform you can dream of, spare BeOS. In 
any case, this is hardly a Xitami issue.

Marc/Mangus:

I have loaded the webalizer tool and got it to work.  But even after verifying the conf file I am only getting a "usage summary" and a "summary by month" chart.  Not getting daily, hourly, top 30 or anything else I see that it can support.  

1.  The default log file support is for CLF, have you gotten it to work with CLFX logs? 
2.  Are you processing your errors.log file too?  Are you able to generate it in the same report within one CONF file?
3.  I have months and months worth of log files....Xitami cycles log files to "acYYMMDD.log" and "erYYMMDD.log", how can I go back process all the log files from previous months?  I saw one method that required combining them all into a single log file using some 3rd party "merge log" app, but that doesn't seem like an efficient way of doing things AND allow me to keep mylogs seperate.  Have you found a way to process older log files using their native naming structure?

Lastly, has anyone used or tried to use AWStats ?  Webalizer seems easier to config and I haven't been able to get it work yet.  Reviews show that AWStats provides more info, but that its also slower b/c its written in Perl vs C.  Almost 1/3 as many records can be processed per second as Webalyzer.

    good day :)

    i was wondering if one of you kind people may be able to suggest a good, free log-reader program... something that may be able to analyse logs over a period of time, and possibly attempt to tally some page-hits.

I notice that Xitami logs ac*.log also get backed up to ac*.log_000, what are the *.log_000 files?  why are they created at all and is it duplicate info that I don't need to pay attention too?

Xitami documentation under Administration indicates the both CLF and CLFX are the default log types....each section at the end says "this is the default"....I presume this can't be the case and would also assume, based on how my log files look, that they actual default is CLF.  Can anyone confirm this please.

sorry for asking on Xitami support...though it is "kind of" related.  But I didn't have your personal emails so it had to be here.  

One last quetion, are your Xtiami logs set to hourly, daily, weekly rotation....and based on that how often do you run webalizer against the newest logs?

Heh, forget all my previous questions...it took me a while and I finally got it all to work correctly.  

However, I do have one finaly question about Webalizer/GeoWebalizer - is there anyone way to get more granular with Geo-IP, at the moment I can only see the "country" a user comes from, but 90% of my traffic comes from the US and I need a way of using GeoWebalizer to show me city origination - anyway to get that to work???  I have read all documentation and haven't found a way to do it.

Thanks

I have no idea with that specific function, but generally, it's up to 
the ISP to report/register an IP range -- some allow "tracing" down to 
city level, some have only a full "country" range. For more info, muck 
around at www.maxmind.com

If an IP is registered to a smaller corporation, you might be able to 
locate the actual street address it sits at -- www.ripe.net will give 
you that info. That is the case for my own web/mail server, for example.

hhhmmm, I don't think its possible then.  I am using the patched version of 
webalizer from "maxmind" called geowebalizer....as best I can tell the app 
only does country coding, whch is a shame, becuase the IP database and perls 
geo::ip and geo::ip::region provide down to the region/city level (even 
postal code)...just can't seem to get the geowebalizer to show that detail 
in the graphs produced from the log files.

Unless you know another way?

Also, has anyone figured out to get webalizer to display the full path 
variables passed to a cgi script.

My implementation only shows URLs but with out any of the GET variables that 
each link uses to process the page.

As in: "/cgi-bin/showPosting.pl"
which is the root script, but I need to see the full path that called it as 
in "/cgi-bin/showPosting.pl?catID=5&amp;forID=24"

those details in the logs with webalizer will allow me to capture where my 
users are going to the most within my site.

Has anyone gotten Xitami to fully work with AWStats ?  I got it working but 
I think the LogFile format option(s) is preventing AWStats from providing 
all the data and charts that it can, particularly with OS,Agents and Search 
Strings - If so, what file format is your Xitami set for and what file 
format have you programmed AWStats to retrieve - if custom can you include 
your custom LogFile format

Xitami Log Format:
AWStats Log Format:

Thanks.

oops...
my mistake.

i believe i misread or misunderstood the introduction on the webanalizer
web-site, and assumed it was something written in perl... when in actual
fact, they were stating the exact opposite.

the perl assumption is basically where i lost interest... but i'm on my way
back to take a better look right now.  thanks again.

Message-ID: <BAY105-F35F010C1020C827CBD729BF8D70@phx.gbl>


Has anyone tried to run Xitami v2.4d9 on a Win2003 Server w/ the latest 
Service Pack 2?  I am installing a new server and the only difference 
between it and my older server is a) hardware and b) SP2.  My new server is 
crashing about 3 times a day and requires a physical reboot.  All services 
and remote access simply stop working and the server has to be power cycled. 
  I have run a system level hardware diagnostics which hasn't turned up 
anything and the only thing I can think of is that its somehow related to 
the most recent service pack 2 microsoft release a month or two ago.

But being that Xitami hasn't been supported in years the only way to find 
out a problem is if other users have had the same or similar issues.

The new server is an HP DL380, 6Gb of memory, with a 6 disk array configured 
as a 4+1+1spare

Overall it sounds like a pure Windows vs. your box issue.
