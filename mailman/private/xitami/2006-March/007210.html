I don't use the admin panel, and it was 200 not 2000 but still. I used the
web admin about a week before I decided it was useless. Still talking a lot.

 
The aut setup might work I don't think I need the aut files anyway.I never
thought about setting it in Xitami.cfg. As for the cfg still I'm talking
about 100+ per site then on my 2 national sites it could be 1 file per state
then 1 file per county. Even if it was one .cfg per site that would suffice
for me if I could put all the subdomains in it.
 
I don't know CGI either. Used to know some but don't know much now. I have
thought about writing something in PHP but I find I don't have that kind of
time anymore.

Very simple.

You add 101 files, not 2000.

Disable online administration and disallow the web admin interface for your
VHosts, as it would render Xitami wide open to security leaks having web
admin enabled.

As such, you point all AUT files for your VHosts to one single disabled
admin file.

Voila, 99 files out of 100 removed.

As for the other 100 files, I find it extremely useful to have them in
separate files, thereby simplifying the management of documents.

Besides, it is a very simple dead to write a CGI for your self, to run off
of the root on the server,
to effectively write your own admin panel, which only you have access to and
is hidden from 
the publicly known view, by the documentation files of xitami.

As such you can in fact turn off the web admin completely, disable the LRWP
from port 81, unless you use it for some ssl functions.
You should already have disabled the ftp, which is controlled from the
default.cfg anyway, in a INI file style.

All of which is really simple to manage.

That's the way I do it at least.
Pretty simple and 99% of my work is done by remote control anyway.
In fact I have not had a monitor on any one of my servers for the past three
years.
Except once, when installing a new machine 4 months ago.

Thought I'd start a wish list, maybe someone has thought about it and maybe
some have implemented it. The first item on my Xitami Wish List is this.

I would like all my .aut's in one file and all my .cfg's in one file and
xitami just call the section that it needs. I have 12 sites but I have 32
.cfg's and 32 .aut's and I'm getting ready to add over 100 subdomains which
will increase my file count by 200+. Then if I might do that for 2 other
site which will increase it again by 400+. That's a lot of small little
files to keep track of. 

Ideas, suggestions? 

Move to Apache????
