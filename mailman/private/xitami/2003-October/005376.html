<PRE>Thanks
but i have no idea what you are talking about, i am a developer of php i use xitami web server on a local machine using the loop back address, it works great, but some of the files need the chmod command when i upload on the internet i can do it, but not on my machine.

Cheers
Mike

</I>I am assuming you are talking about in the linux version.  The best way
would be to telnet/ssh into the box, cd to the file, and do the chmod.  I
know that some ftp programs allow you to do a chmod from them also.  If you
are not sure what chmod does or how to do it then just telnet/ssh into the
linux bow and do a man chmod.
