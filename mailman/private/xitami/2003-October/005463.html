<PRE>Plus, for people like me who don't need 99% of the messages that come =
through, a &quot;forum&quot; makes more sense.  Then again, the amount of traffic =
on this list is a small percentage of the email I get, so the extra mail =
I just delete isn't a big deal.

-----Original Message-----



Forums are nice because archived messages are so much easier to browse =
and search. Several times I have gone to the Xitami archives (when I can =
even find them) looking for information that I know has been covered =
before, only to have to read through tons of listings. And then, if I =
find a topic of interest, I have to track down the replies, because =
nothing is threaded.

A forum can give you the best of both worlds. MUCH better organization, =
archiving, and searching. AND, most forum scripts let you &quot;subscribe&quot;, =
so everything still comes in via email. You never have to visit the =
forum, unless you want to make a post. And you can post without giving =
an email address.
