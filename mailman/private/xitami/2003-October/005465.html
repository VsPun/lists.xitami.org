(and every other month.)  The URL at the bottom of EVERY mailing list
message points at the list general information page, from where you can
unsubscribe, view the list archives, etc.  One of the options for
viewing each month's archives is &quot;threaded&quot;.

I don't have any control over the display of email addresses in the
mailing list archives.  The main place they seem to be displayed is in
the &quot;In message.... writes:&quot; type lines, which were included in the
original messages.

It's not really my place to comment on a web forum (I have suggested to
the iMatix technical staff they might wish to comment on the issue, but
so far they haven't had time), but I will observe that having multiple
support locations will tend to spread the &quot;self help&quot; support thinly.
The most valuable part of any &quot;user support&quot; forum is the number of
users who can say &quot;I remember that issue, and I fixed it like this...&quot;.
So one support location is probably better than lots of them.
