<PRE>I went to the site to see how it looks and it looks good. But there is one
problem. The site behaves as if it was in some sort of edit mode. Whichever
element I click on it gets the selection nodes and I can move, delete and
even resize those elements by grabbing those nodes, just like in a graphics
application. I am using Mozilla 1.5.

If my description isn't so great then I could email a screenshot to you or
place a picture on a web somewhere


Now, don't take me wrong. I appreciate the site and your effort and I like
the BB. I tried starting one myself (<A HREF="http://members.lycos.co.uk/xitami">http://members.lycos.co.uk/xitami</A>). But
when I go to a site that acts funny with mozilla I never come back. This is
also true with many other people who prefer a more secure Mozilla browser
than IE.

If this issue is resolved I would send you a all xitami list messages parsed
into a tab delimited format, unless you prefer Firebird database format. I
think that putting the body of the existing information on a BB is critical
to its success.

Thanks.

Derek

I set one up, nobody seems to want to use it. All you have to do is register
to use it.
