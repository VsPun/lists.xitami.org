<PRE>Well, I think it's a great idea, no matter how its done.  Though, I do have 
one comment about Usenet: there are many users that are new to the web who 
are trying to configure xitami for the first time, getting them to 
understand and for them to get to Usenet could be problematic for them.   
Keeping it to a iMatix or xitami.com site would keep it contained and easily 
accessable by all, as well, a knowledge base owned by iMatix.  Maybe the 
site could be mirrored to prevent single point of failure.

You mentioned an archive of all emails does exist.  Where and how can I 
access it?  Is it a seachable archive?

I agree.....snip snip snip.

&gt;<i>Your request made me realize that perhaps Usenet might be a better
</I>&gt;<i>approach.  (1) it's distributed, rather than reliant upon a single server
</I>&gt;<i>site; (2) the propagation mechanisms are already there; (3) DejaGoogle
</I>&gt;<i>provides an archive and searching mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I hunted around to see what sort of groups already exist; I had
</I>&gt;<i>expected to see, for example, groups discussing apache.  To my surprise,
</I>&gt;<i>althought there were some national groups (in japan.* and dk.*), and also
</I>&gt;<i>an alt group, there was nothing in the Big-8 comp.* hierarchy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>ISTM that the correct place would have been in a sub-division of
</I>&gt;<i>comp.infosystems.www.server.*; however, the taxonomy of that is by O/S
</I>&gt;<i>platform.  Is anyone on this mailing list already active anywhere within
</I>&gt;<i>that comp.i.w.s.* hierarchy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There IS an archive of these mailing list posts: details are in the
</I>&gt;<i>headers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>[BTW, _one_ of the annoying aspects of a mailing list is repeated
</I>&gt;<i>regurgitation of untrimmed quoted material by those that post their
</I>&gt;<i>comments at the top.  Much unnecessary volume could be cut from this
</I>&gt;<i>present list if all posters learnt how to formulate replies properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
