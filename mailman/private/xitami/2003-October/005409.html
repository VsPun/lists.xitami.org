<PRE>Sorry to bother everyone.

Someone, who connects to pol.co.uk (an ISP in the United Kingdom), has 
taken to bouncing all the messages from the Xitami list back to me with
a forged bounce message claiming they are from <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@lists.xitami.org.">postmaster@lists.xitami.org.</A>

Received: from modem-4025.dasyure.dialup.pol.co.uk ([81.78.63.185] helo=lists.xitami.org)
        by tmailb1.svr.pol.co.uk with esmtp (Exim 4.14)
        id 1ACEkX-0004J8-Kg
        for <A HREF="mailto:xitami-admin@lists.xitami.org">xitami-admin@lists.xitami.org</A>; Wed, 22 Oct 2003 09:53:49 +0100

I'm assuming this means that they don't want to be on the mailing list
any more.

However the bounce messages are worse than useless as they contain no
indication of which account the messages were delivered to, no headers
from the original message, and there are no users on the Xitami mailing
list using a pol.co.uk email address.

Perhaps someone can help me identify what email address the mail is being
delivered to, and then I can remove them from the mailing list, and 
everyone can be happy.

Failing that I'll have to complain to the abuse department at pol.co.uk
and see if they can either identify the user (eg, from the IP address
they were assigned at the time) or ask them to stop doing so.

People: if you don't want to get messages on the Xitami mailing list,
which you subscribed to, please unsubscribe.  If you can't figure out how,
then email me directly (&lt;<A HREF="mailto:ewen@imatix.com">ewen@imatix.com</A>&gt;) and I'll do it for you.

Ewen
