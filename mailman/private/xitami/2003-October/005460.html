<PRE>Forums are nice because archived messages are so much easier to browse an=
d search=2E Several times I have gone to the Xitami archives (when I can =
even find them) looking for information that I know has been covered befo=
re=2C only to have to read through tons of listings=2E And then=2C if I f=
ind a topic of interest=2C I have to track down the replies=2C because no=
thing is threaded=2E

A forum can give you the best of both worlds=2E MUCH better organization=2C=
 archiving=2C and searching=2E AND=2C most forum scripts let you =22subsc=
ribe=22=2C so everything still comes in via email=2E You never have to vi=
sit the forum=2C unless you want to make a post=2E And you can post witho=
ut giving an email address=2E
