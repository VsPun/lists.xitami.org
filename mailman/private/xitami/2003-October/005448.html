<PRE>Hi everyone this is my first post here, and i am not sure where to begin.

I have tested a couple of home servers recently looking for good reliable and 
secure applications. I have just unistalled &quot;602Pro LAN SUITE 2003&quot; which is 
excellent in its own rights and very very very easy to install and use. Even a 
total newbie to a computor or even the net can get it up and running in less 
than 5 minutes. 
The main reason for the uninstall was to test others before 
buying. xitami is one of the tests. I decided on this test because the 
xitami.org proclaims that its easy to install, lmao. I went throught the 
online help, faq and god only knows what else, to no avail. In fact i came 
across 3 different explanations on the setup on one site.

1st when the application installs under windows, its there you set up the 
password. It doesnt install anything it just unzips with no sign of a password 
setup.

2nd you must change the password etc in the .aut and the.cfg files. Doesnt do 
a thing.

3rd you have to create to new files .aut and .cfg. doesnt do a thing

So then, with all the different ways of doing things which is the correct way, 
oh sorry, you cant answer that because nothing works there is no possible way 
to logon as admin.

I then went on to reading the archives a little, that is when i eventually 
figured out how the damn thing works, to realise there is a possiblity of spam 
mail and god only knows what else. I also read that there is only 500 active 
members. Sorry but thats your own fault. If you get rid of this stupid mailing 
list a put a good forum www.phpbb.com for exapmle (FREE) you will find that 
you will have more members, that can discuss things between themselves, faster 
and maybe help you solve the screwed help system on the site. How can you say 
its easy to setup when you cant explain how to do it? i havent seen one single 
helpfull answer in the archives.

I am looking at testing and eventually buying because i am in the process of 
starting up my own online 3D website creating business. Its up to you guys now 
to get it running if you want the sale. If not dont bother answering and i 
will go back to something that works, as ive cant afford to play around any 
longer.

Thanks in advance and i hope you understand my frustration and anger after 
wasting many hours trying to get something (EASY) to work.

Mr.peeved off
