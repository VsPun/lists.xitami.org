<PRE>&gt;<i> I don't have any control over the display of email addresses in the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list archives.  The main place they seem to be displayed is in

The problem I have with this is email harvesters.  I have been a victim of
this before on a Linux mail list.  They were just archiving the mail list
and some harvester scanned the archive and got the email address of
everybody on the list.  I am still battling spam from that.  The way the
Linux group fixed it was to send the emails into a program that replaces out
the email in the header before going to the archiving.
