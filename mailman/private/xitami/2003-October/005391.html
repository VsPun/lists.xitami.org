I am upgrading from 2.4d9 to 2.5c0 and I want to ensure that I don't =
screw anything up.  Which files do I need to move (or backup) before =
doing a complete upgrade to 2.5c0?  Anything else I need to be aware of =
before I do this?

As well, I have read as much as the xitami.com site displays about the =
new version, but it still didn't list the latest features and fixes.  Or =
at least I couldn't find where it was at.  Could someone tell me the =
latest and greatest features (not bug fixes) in 2.5c0.   The biggest =
feature I have been looking for (or fix, depending on perspective) is =
allowing Domain adimistrators to admin their own domains without access =
to other domains and without access to administration of the server.  =
For the longest time (I have been a user for nearly 5 years) when a user =
has access to their own domain they also have access to all domains and =
server admin access to.  Either that or I have been doing it wrong all =
this time.

Thanx.

PS:  Has all development on the built in FTP server stopped?  I haven't =
seen any improvement on that in a long time.
