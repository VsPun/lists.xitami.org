<PRE>Don't you find it odd that the only browser that doesn't work with the site
is Mozilla? The InReview administrator said that he would look into it but
he is not going to jump through hoops for a few Xitami users. Maybe Mozilla
needs to look into their program. As I said there are over 60,000 users
registered to use that site 150 - 200 online at any given time. You do the
math.

I think you've missed the point; a user should NEVER have to change
browser settings so as to be able to access any particular site: rather
the site's designer has a duty to write HTML which works with any
browser.  A browser's settings are supposed to allow the user to express
his/her preferences about presentation[1]: they are NOT there to excuse
the shortcomings of the web site itself.

Besides, making Mozilla use HTTP/1.0 protocols will block access to the
vast majority of other sites nowadays that host multiple virtual servers
at one IP address.

[1] E.g. some people are poorly-sighted, and hence want to override the
site's settings and use large fonts.
