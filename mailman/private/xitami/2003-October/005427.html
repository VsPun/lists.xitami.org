Hello Brian,

BHK&gt; BTW,  _one_  of  the  annoying  aspects  of  a mailing list is repeated
BHK&gt; regurgitation  of  untrimmed  quoted  material by those that post their
BHK&gt; comments  at  the  top.  Much unnecessary volume could be cut from this
BHK&gt; present list if all posters learnt how to formulate replies properly

That's got to be a job for the moderators. Reference to posting guidelines.

also

I am subscribed to the list (rarely post partly because of the spam issue...
my  email  address  being  archived)  and much prefer lists to forums on the
whole,  even with the list quirks e.g I have a folder full of unthreaded but
related messages simply because people won't select a message and hit reply.
As  I  view  my  list  mail  in  threaded view it is very irritating to have
orphans  and  broken  threads  all over the place. But you get problems with
forums  as  well.  With forums someone might start a thread and 3 or 4 posts
down  someone else takes the post off of the original topic. If you've got a
thread  with  30  or  40  posts  you could have many side topics all the way
through the one thread. In this respect it is much worse that using lists.

IMO  if  the  mail  archive problem was sorted - that is, if email addresses
were  protected  from  spammers  -  and  the  Xitami  list was promoted on a
complimentary  web  board,  the  list  membership  would  probably gradually
increase.  As  I  said, I prefer lists as they are less time consuming and I
don't have to worry about pages loading and board lag etc.

Thought I'd drop my 10 penneth in. Hope this is OK.
