<PRE>Jerry,
	I located a very nice FTP program that may give you what you're
asking for. It is File Share Pro and you can download a copy of it at
www.wfshome.com . I've got it running on the same server as my Xitami.
You can set it up to require a Username and Password and it will give
you a daily log of who, when and what your users downloaded. I
implemented it so my company can track the sales force's updating their
material costs. I &quot;tried&quot; it for a couple of weeks and it works so well,
I purchased a copy of it from Wfshome. As far as there being
security/encryption of the data being transferred, the FTP protocol does
not offer that and was never designed to do so. If that is what you
desire, I'd look into some of the &quot;Blow Fish&quot; encryption technologies.
These programs are usually very inexpensive and do indeed provide some
extreme security. A good suggestion would be to &quot;Blow Fish&quot; encrypt the
files you put on your FTP site and give your user the &quot;Blow Fish'
decryption program and the password to enable them to extract your
encrypted files. Drop me a line if you can't locate an encryption
program and I'll see if I can dig one up for you.

Hi Jerry,

I'm not sure exactly what type of security you're referring to.  The
term 
&quot;security&quot; usually encompasses several different components.  One of
these 
is validation, which Xitami provides in the form of username/password 
prompts.  This is the one of the simplest forms of validation.  Once you

validate with a username and password, your connection is &quot;trusted&quot; by
the 
server, and you can send and receive data (within your privledges).

If you want security &quot;of the actual data being transmitted,&quot; you're 
probably looking for encryption.  I am not aware that Xitami provides 
encryption on the fly like that, although I am not an expert at this.
If 
Xitami were to encrypt data, it would have to be some sort of encryption

that can be decrypted by a web browser, FTP client, or even a DOS 
session.  I am not aware of any type of &quot;decryption&quot; algorithm or
process 
that occurs at, for example, a simple DOS prompt telnet session.

Perhaps I'm just not reading your question correctly.  If you know the 
username and password for an FTP server (any server), I'm not sure what 
other security could be provided &quot;on the fly,&quot; and if it was, I'm not
sure 
what kind of additional authentication process you'd have to go through
in 
order to read the data.

Can you give an example of a feature on a different FTP server that does

this?  Thanks!

Michael
