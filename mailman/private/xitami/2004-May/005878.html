<PRE>====
&gt;<i> All we want to do is tell someone how to use FTP (syntax example of an
</I>&gt;<i> FTP PUT, etc.) in a WEB Browser ADDRESS pane (Internet Explorer for
</I>&gt;<i> example) to the Xitami FTP Server from somewhere on the Internet outside
</I>&gt;<i> this LAN.
</I>
Why on earth are you persisting in trying to use Internet Explorer, which
is a BROWSER and hence intended for looking AT information, in the
entirely unsuitable role of a general-purpose FTP client?  IE is ONLY
able to be an FTP client for the purposes of GETting files; it is useless
for the purposes of any other action, such as PUTting a file, or renaming
files on the server.  Come to that, the whole scheme of URIs (or URLs,
for those that fail to keep up with standards) has no provision for
specifying any form of FTP transfer apart from a GET operation (except
for performing a LIST, to get a directory listing; this can be done by
ensuring that the trailing solidus is present after the directory name).
====


While I'm not particular thrilled with IE as an FTP client, it -- v6 -- does
in fact have the capability to Get, Put, Rename, Delete, Create Folders,
Delete Folders.

It works pretty much like a Windows Explorer window after connecting
to an FTP site.

Some users who can't quite grasp the workings of an FTP client do just
fine with IE6... Sometimes you have to go with what works.
