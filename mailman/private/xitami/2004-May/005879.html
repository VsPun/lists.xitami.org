<PRE>Hello Bruce and Jeff :) :)

Bruce,,,,,that did the trick,,,,thanks for the link!

Jeff,,,,THANKS for your comments and I agree! :)

The end users have no problems with either an FTP Client or Server or the FTP CLIENT under MSDOS or any other FTP application for either client or server. We are trying to catch up with stuff we used over 25 years ago. It appears after many years all this Internet stuff seems to have evolved the way a lot of folks predicted at that time,,,even before ARPANET was the term for the day.

It's a matter of what the right and left hand,,, I mean click know what to do rather than a Browser ADDRESS pane entry.

Again,,,,Bruce,,,that link corrected our misgivings about any Browser Address pane keyin and provided the information so we know the difference between the right and left hand,,,,I mean click!!!! :) :)


THANKS!!!! :) :) :)

Jerry


&gt;<i> ====
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All we want to do is tell someone how to use FTP (syntax example of an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FTP PUT, etc.) in a WEB Browser ADDRESS pane (Internet Explorer for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example) to the Xitami FTP Server from somewhere on the Internet outside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this LAN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why on earth are you persisting in trying to use Internet Explorer, which
</I>&gt;<i> is a BROWSER and hence intended for looking AT information, in the
</I>&gt;<i> entirely unsuitable role of a general-purpose FTP client?  IE is ONLY
</I>&gt;<i> able to be an FTP client for the purposes of GETting files; it is useless
</I>&gt;<i> for the purposes of any other action, such as PUTting a file, or renaming
</I>&gt;<i> files on the server.  Come to that, the whole scheme of URIs (or URLs,
</I>&gt;<i> for those that fail to keep up with standards) has no provision for
</I>&gt;<i> specifying any form of FTP transfer apart from a GET operation (except
</I>&gt;<i> for performing a LIST, to get a directory listing; this can be done by
</I>&gt;<i> ensuring that the trailing solidus is present after the directory name).
</I>&gt;<i> ====
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I'm not particular thrilled with IE as an FTP client, it -- v6 -- does
</I>&gt;<i> in fact have the capability to Get, Put, Rename, Delete, Create Folders,
</I>&gt;<i> Delete Folders.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It works pretty much like a Windows Explorer window after connecting
</I>&gt;<i> to an FTP site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some users who can't quite grasp the workings of an FTP client do just
</I>&gt;<i> fine with IE6... Sometimes you have to go with what works.
