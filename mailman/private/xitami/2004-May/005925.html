<PRE>&gt;<i> As far as there being
</I>&gt;<i> security/encryption of the data being transferred, the FTP protocol
</I>&gt;<i> does not offer that and was never designed to do so. If that is what
</I>&gt;<i> you desire, I'd look into some of the &quot;Blow Fish&quot; encryption
</I>&gt;<i> technologies. These programs are usually very inexpensive and do
</I>&gt;<i> indeed provide some extreme security. A good suggestion would be to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Blow Fish&quot; encrypt the files you put on your FTP site and give your
</I>&gt;<i> user the &quot;Blow Fish' decryption program and the password to enable
</I>&gt;<i> them to extract your encrypted files.
</I>
This is good advice, but I wouldn't encrypt the files, I would 
encrypt the connection using SSH or the like. I am in fact doing this 
already, using the Zebedee Secure Tunnel program 
<A HREF="http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/">http://www.winton.org.uk/zebedee/</A> and various free FTP servers 
(chiefly WarFTPd and GuildFTPd). Zebedee both encrypts and compresses 
the network traffic, including control commands, and can be 
configured to act totally transparent to the user. It's an easy and 
totally free way to set up a simple VPN, actually. I have customers 
who have been running this for years with few complaints.

Such solutions can of course be used with Xitami, too, but to be 
brutally honest -- the FTP part of Xitami is not good. Nothing to use 
for anything resembling a &quot;production environment&quot;, but somewhat 
usable for just getting small files onto a web site, which of course 
is the reason why it's there to begin with ;-)

To the OP:
1) No, not natively.
2) No.
