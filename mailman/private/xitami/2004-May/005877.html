<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Do I need a c.conf? I don't have one, but it is mentioned in c.conf.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; No, you don't need this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where would I find one anyway? It may be somewhere that I set a number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still can't get over the concept that a file might be required, is
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned in a particular file, but that file doesn't exist!  I presume
</I>&gt;<i> one of the instances of &quot;c.conf&quot; in that line quoted above is actually
</I>&gt;<i> something else?
</I>
The file didn't appear to be required to the point that the build didn't
go without it, and since there doesn't seem to be any documentation
anywhere on it I just ignored that part.  The documentation on
xitami.com seems to refer to the 2.4d9 style of build system (using
xibuild) so you just have to infer from the source what to do ... it
seemed from the source that the conf file isn't required, and that those
settings could be changed directly in the &quot;c&quot; file.  My guess was that
it was something that the developers used for compiling under different
platforms without changing the package.
