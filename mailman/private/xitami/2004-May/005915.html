<PRE>&gt;<i> Unfortunately ... I can't afford servers, and going down when they Break.
</I>&gt;<i> 'cause Xitami never broke.
</I>
I'm running Xitami on Mandrake Linux computers on AMD 466MHz.  And they do
just fine.  And you can get a computer like that new for less than $100 in
the US today if try hard at all.  It can't be THAT much worse overseas.  One
of the great things about Xitami, as I am sure you know, is that it runs
with such a little footprint compared to most servers, making it very fast
in comparision.

And rather than throwing out the &quot;broken&quot; computers, try and find out what
is broken on them.  Most of the time its only one component like the RAM,
MB, Processor, HD, or PSU.  And on a Xitami capable machine that has been
around for a couple of years, you should be able to replace whatever it is
for less than $50.  Even if you have never broken open a case before, its
not that hard at all.  And anyway, what do have to lose?  How to replace it
is in the manual.

All of my machines (except my laptops) are built from scratch.  I do this
because it is soo much more affordable to keep them up.  I stay at
pricepoint.  Any one component over $50 I don't usually bother with -
depended on the machine's duty in life.  Man, you can get an Athelon XP 2200
for $51.15 including shipping in the US - Or an athelon 700 Mhz Slot A for
$15 (with free shipping).  If you don't like AMD, go with a Pentium III 1.13
GHz for $48, or a Celeron 800 for $17.  I found this stuff while writing
this on www.pricewatch.com in less than a minute.  You can even get a 100GB
hard drive for $58 before shipping, or a 25Gig for $25.  You name it,
Motherboards, RAM, etc - stuff that was top-of-the-line a couple of years
ago is CHEAP.

None of my computers EVER die, they just get upgraded when something goes
wrong, I just replace it for like $50.  Motherboards too.  I still have 2.1
Gig HDs running that I bought for $4 each when they were worth like $300
each 10 years ago.  IDE Controllers are cheap.

Good Luck,
