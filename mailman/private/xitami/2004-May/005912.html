<PRE>Yes, it is a legitimate concern if you don't want others to see what is on
your server.  But, you also said you have a router between your computer and
DSL modem, which means you have an unresolvable IP address that cannot be
accessed unsolicited by just anyone on the internet as long as you have not
setup a NAT to that computer (Don't worry, if you didn't do it, it isn't
setup).  So, you should be just fine.  If you are really concerned, turn on
your firewall in your router (not a bad idea to have it on anyway), and to
be REALLY safe, block incoming ports 80 and 21, then you should definately
be safe.

But, if there are any other computers connected to your router (on the same
subnet), they will be able access the server on that machine.  I wouldn't be
sure how to stop this other than activating a firewall on the PC that is
running on the server.  And at that point, I am not sure localhost will
work.  Probably will, though.

Good luck,

- Jay

Subject: [Xitami] only localhost access for xitami - help


&gt;<i> I am using xitami as a testbed for cgi.
</I>&gt;<i> It's on my pc. But my pc has dsl. I want to block
</I>&gt;<i> any outside access to xitami server, as I said it's
</I>&gt;<i> on my pc and I only want to allow access to it from
</I>&gt;<i> THAT (my) pc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a valid concern since I am networked to
</I>&gt;<i> the internet via my dsl?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so what's the best way to do what I want?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> note: I have a linksys router between my dsl modem
</I>&gt;<i> and pc - I think it has simple firewall capabilities, if
</I>&gt;<i> that's any help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
