<PRE>I believe Xitami Pro only allows you to have SSL running on the primary/real domain bound to the primary IP of the server and it won't work on virtual 'named' domains.  How exactly are you binding Xitami's multiple IPs to specific domains?  Are you depending solely on DNS - it won't work using DNS based hosting?

Read this info on Virtual Hosts: <A HREF="http://legacy.imatix.com/html/xitami/index8.htm#vhosts">http://legacy.imatix.com/html/xitami/index8.htm#vhosts</A>

1.  Physical server must have multiple IPs
2.  Xitami must be specifically bound to the desired IPs
3.  The virtual hosts section in the .cfg file must have IP to vhost associations
        ie: x.x.x.255 = d_domain.cfg
4.  You cannot bind named domains to SSL vhosts
        ie: www.***d.com = d_domain.cfg
5. Make certain your [Server] global configurations are not conflicting your vhost configurations
6. Use DNS to make certain www.d_domian.com points to x.x.x.225 IP address and that Reverse DNS is properly working, SSL uses Reverse DNS to verify authenticity.

Make certain the above is all in order and let us know if works out or not.

  Subject: [Xitami] XITAMI, multiple domains and SSL


  As I long time Xitami user I consider myself well versed in configuring Xitami. However today I ran into a problem and have yet to figure out a solution.

   

  I have using XITAMI PRO running on a server serving web pages to multiple domains for several years. Until today only one of the domains needed SSL.  I have been running the SSL for that domain for some time with no problems, Today I purchased a separate second certificate for the new domain, however today try as I could  I could not get XITAMI configured for SSL on multiple domains. The instructions state that SSL is only supported for multiple domains when using IP based domains I have tried to do this to no avail.

   

  My configuration is as follows;

  First IP ADDRESS XXX.XXX.XXX.251 handles ****a.com, ****b.com and ****c.com.  

  ****a.com has its own certificate and key referenced in sslhttp.cfs (This Works)

  Second IP ADDRESS xxx.xxx.xxx.225  handles ****d.com and I have a certificate and key for that domain already purchased  

  I tested the certificate and key globally and they work so that is not the problem.

  Try as I might I could not get the correct configuration for domain ****d.com to reference the second certificate and key. Is there anyone on the list that can help me with the correct configuration to make this work? The SSL instructions included with even with the PRO version of XITAMI is not very detailed.

   

  Sorry for the obfuscated IPs and domains but we are a medical company and I need to comply with HIPPA.
