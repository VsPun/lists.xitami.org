<PRE>With the last versions of xitami I noticed that on slow connections
(dial-up) it often happens that the connection breaks and there is a socket
error; even downloading Xitami i had to use getright because of the
disconections.

I tried to solve this recompiling with Borland C++ builder (it was
difficoult... some things was quite tricky to make it work... lots of
warnings and some errors... but I did it somehow).

I think it's some timeout error on writing on the socket: if I understood
how it works, when a file is uploaded is divided in segments and uploaded,
and there is a timeout for every segment to be sent. The size of the segment
is in the file &quot;smttran.c&quot;, the &quot;var&quot; name is &quot;BUFFERSIZE&quot; and is initially
set to 32768L, (32k), the timeout is specified in &quot;smtsock.c&quot; and is named
&quot;WRITE_TIMEOUT&quot; and is set to 10 (seconds); this means that if you can get
more than 32k in 10 sec (&gt;3.2kbyte/sec) everything should be ok, otherwise
the socket &quot;thinks&quot; he isn't able to send data. I tried lowering BUFFERSIZE
to 4096 (4k) and WRITE_TIMEOUT to 60 sec (it makes about 70 bytes/sec should
be enough!) and it seems to work.

I hope at Imatix try this so, if it works, everyone can use it.
