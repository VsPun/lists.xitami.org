<PRE>Ewen says:

 &gt; Okay, it sounds like the fix in 2.4d9/2.5b5 narrows it down to the
 &gt; situation where:
 &gt; (a) the device actually exists and is being used (eg, a printer is
 &gt;     installed); and
 &gt; (b) the timing of the access is &quot;unlucky&quot;

I'd agree with that.

 &gt; And my guess is the &quot;something changing&quot; is something like
 &gt; another program
 &gt; having the device open (blocking us out, so we assume it is not a device)
 &gt; when we first try to find out if it is a device, and but it has closed it
 &gt; (freeing up the device) by the time we try to open it again to read from
 &gt; it.

I'd be surprised if this was the case as it is repeatable on every occasion
and nothing else is using the device, so the &quot;other program&quot; can only be
Xitami itself. One thing I forgot to mention is that in every case where
there is a device present pre-crash I don't get an error page returned, just
a blank page.

 &gt; I've got a couple of ideas to try, although as I commented, I'm somewhat
 &gt; hampered by the fact that I can't reproduce the problem...

Happy to install debug code on my PC if it helps. I suppose your code
automatically denying access to known device names is a no no?
