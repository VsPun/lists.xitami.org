<PRE>Thank you Ewen, I firmly agree with your post.  Although I agree that *nix
based server is superior to a win9x server, I still use Windows ME with
Xitami.  I host my site off of the same machine that i use as a Digtal Audio
Workstation (bad idea, I know, but that is the way it will be for a while).
And although *nix is making progress in the professional audio world, it
still has a while before catching up to the compatibilty of the 9x world.

I am genuinely interested in valid responses to the original question of
this thread.  I am a programmer by trade, and although I deal in proprietary
languages now professionally, I am still familiar with languages such as VB,
and would be interested in developing CGI in this language.

Please do not flame someone for not complying with your standards. That not
only discourages the user who created the original question, but it also
limits actual valid responses, and further valid questions due to fear of
fire as well.


Sincerely,

Jay Aldrich

</I>&gt;<i> This is not the forum for trying to convert someone from operating system

&gt;<i> another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original poster was asking for help for a particular situation. Your

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I can understand your enthusiasm for *nix based platforms, this is

&gt;<i> the place for it. If you can't offer meaningful help in regards to the

</I>serves no
