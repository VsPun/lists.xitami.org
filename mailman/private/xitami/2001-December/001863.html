Thank you.

I did find that if I'm root Xitami does startup on port 80.

So I tried putting /pathto_xitami/xitami in my rc.local file at startup, and 
it doesn't start.  :-(

&gt;<i> which distro of linux are you using?
</I>
Mandrake 8.1, which I'm utterly disgusted with right at this moment.  
Upgraded the kernel which required a new iptables.  Installed the .rpm's from 
mandrake and now they tell me I need to:

Dec 29 09:11:48 bastille-firewall: iptables v1.2.4: can't initialize iptables 
table `filter': Module is wrong version 
Dec 29 09:11:48 bastille-firewall: Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to 
be upgraded. 

I'm rebuilding from 2.4.17 from kernel.org in the hopes that that solves this 
problem right now.

If any one has any help to offer with this problem, please contact me off 
this list since this isn't on topic here.

Some place out there there must be a nice small linux distro?  FreeBSD is 
looking better all the time.
