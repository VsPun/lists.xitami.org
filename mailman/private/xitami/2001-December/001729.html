Old code
    /*  Create root XML 
item                                                 */
    root_item = xml_new (NULL, &quot;directory&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
   
    /*  Now transform directory listing into an XML 
tree                     */
    total_files = 0;
    total_size  = 0;

New code
    /*  Create root XML 
item                                                 */
    root_item = xml_new (NULL, &quot;directory&quot;, &quot;&quot;);
    /*  Output path to directory for GSL scripts */
    xml_put_attr (root_item, &quot;physical_path&quot;, p_http-&gt; file_name);
   
    /*  Now transform directory listing into an XML 
tree                     */
    total_files = 0;
    total_size  = 0;

This works fine and allows GSL directory scripts to search for README or 
similar.

It doesn't matter but it is important to note that you will not get the 
absoluet path of non-aliased directories, just the directory relative to 
the xitami base directory. I.e. you get webpage/images/ for the images 
directory in a default config. Since GSL doesn't seem to have a command 
to list the current working directory (e.g. /usr/local/xitami or 
/opt/xitami) you cannot infer from this variable where the xitami server 
is located on the file system. This seems to me to be excellent security 
as I can't see why you would need it but it should be noted for future 
reference.

However in testing this it seems that you cannot have an alias like 
relative = ../relative/ whereas rel = ./rel does work and the directory 
given for GSL is rel/

This could possibly be another bug?
