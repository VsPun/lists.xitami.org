That is weird.  The source on the Xitami download pages is the source
that was used to build the Xitami binaries on the download pages (taken
straight from our CVS archive).  The binaries were build with MSVC 6.0,
with the &quot;install this service pack before distributing binaries&quot;
service pack installed.  IIRC the binaries were built on a Windows 98
machine.

Basically this is &quot;close enough&quot; to what you had that I'd expect you to
get the same results.  About the only thing you might want to do is see 
if there is a newer service pack for MSVC than the one you have; I have
a feeling that there is one after the sp1 you mentoin.  

Have you managed to figure out anything about the problem in the few
weeks since you posted?
