<PRE>Paul.
   Thanks for all the comments.  I &quot;upgraded&quot; to v2.5 after spending quite
awhile getting 2.4 stable, because a previous post of mine regarding SSI
indicated that I needed 2.5 to do so.  I'll admit that 2.5 has been stable
for me now, although I rewrote my own Win-services routine (the NT service
version of xitami has been faulty for me as far back as I can remember).
    I don't do PERL, PHP, or other scripting language...to me that would be
taking big steps backwards, but all of my dynamic content is generated with
the Win32 executables.  This offers tremendous power for me, but making
small changes to an otherwise static page can be a big job.  I'm a network
guy by trade, but I have a lot of programming experience too.  Web servers
are new to me and I haven't had the time to really examine all the things
they can do.  Your filter idea is really intriguing, but the documentation
for xitami is much like a Microsoft manual -- there is a huge assumption
that the reader has a PHD in web servers -- not the best assumption in my
opinion, but I have to admit that xitami is by far the best server I've used
regardless of the cost.
    My main objective is to simplify the html generation process.  While I
can hard code all the dynamic pages, I'm sure there is a better way to do
it, and that is my quest.  Any/all comments (preferably with the assumption
that I don't do this for a living) are greatly appreciated!

Thanks again!
--Joe

&gt;<i> &gt; If it's a &quot;cgi&quot; then it should be &quot;/cgi-bin/CGINAME&quot;; ie, it should be a
</I>relative URL not a full URL. This is particularly necessary with Xitami 2.4
and the PerlSSI, which takes a fairly naive approach to resolving the path
(stick the CGI directory name in front of CGINAME and hope for the best).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then if PerlSSI &quot;blindly&quot; sticks the CGI directory in front of
</I>&gt;<i> the CGINAME, shouldn't it be &quot;CGINAME&quot; rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/cgi-bin/CGINAME&quot;?
