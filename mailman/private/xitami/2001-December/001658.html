<PRE>
I am a developer of some 20 years experience C, C++, SQL etc. &amp; have both 'PHP
Developers Cookbook' and 'A Programmers Introduction tp PHP 4.0 by W.J. Gilmore
- printed by Apress. At first I thought that the second book was a little light
on, then bought 'PHP Developers Cookbook' only to learn then A Programmers
Introduction tp PHP 4.0 was far more useful. They both have their place, but A
Programmers Introduction tp PHP 4.0 is a far better start and doesn't rely so
much on referring you the php's CURL library as 'PHP Developers Cookbook'.

You should also look at www.hotscripts.com and
<A HREF="http://www.phpclasses.upperdesign.com">http://www.phpclasses.upperdesign.com</A> for loads of pre-written scripts and
classes.

&gt;<i> A) What would be a good first scripting method to begin with on Xitami?
</I>&gt;<i> (PHP,  Perl, etc.)
</I>

     If you want to do web apps/CGI, I suggest PHP. It reads well, it's easy to
learn, OS- and webserver-portable, and has plenty of resources online.

     If you already know programming and like a &quot;How do I... ?&quot; kind of book, I
recommend &quot;PHP Developer's Cookbook&quot; to get started quickly.

     As far as online stuff there's www.php.net, and you can download a
Microsoft Help file from it, all hyperlinked, with the PHP documentation.

     You can probably search for goodies instead of writing them.
www.freshmeat.net, for example.

     For instance, for sharing digital pictures, you may want to use Gallery
(<A HREF="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">http://gallery.sourceforge.net/</A>). For portal stuff, PHP Nuke
(<A HREF="http://www.phpnuke.org">http://www.phpnuke.org</A>), and so on.

     You may need to install MySQL for some apps. Some apps may not support
windows, just UNIX.
