<PRE>I'm sure that Ewen will step in eventually, however, I feel the need to say
this..

This is not the forum for trying to convert someone from operating system to
another.

The original poster was asking for help for a particular situation. Your
response provided no help for his query. Suggesting that he switch to another
operating system was a fruitless effort.

While I can understand your enthusiasm for *nix based platforms, this is not
the place for it. If you can't offer meaningful help in regards to the context
of the questions asked, please refrain from posting. Doing otherwise serves no
purpose other than to drive those who are honestly looking for a helping hand
else where.
