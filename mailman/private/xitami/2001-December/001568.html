When you say file download exactly what do you mean? Are you trying to 
send a fiel to a clients browser from your server or the reverse (upload 
a file from the borwser to the server)? or soemthing else?

I seem to recall a problem with VB and multipart encoded posts - which 
is what you you have if you want a user to upload a file to your server 
but I can't rememebr the details
