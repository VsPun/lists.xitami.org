</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I haven't used NS6 for some months now as I prefer Mozilla (no AOL ads 
etc...) but I would expect this to occur in NS6.1 and 6.2 (NS6.0 was a 
buggy piece of $#!+)

&gt;<i>That was mostly on NT4 but I have also looked with W2000.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Was she/you browsing from the machine that xitami is running on? and is 
it win2k? both machines I have tested it on are running win2k pro. I 
think this is a really specfic bug to win2k and browsing the pages on 
the same machine. I only discovered it when I decided to take some work 
home for the weekend so I copied a bunch of pages from the server to my 
laptop (running win2k pro ) and installed xitami on it to run as test 
server.

Today I went back and tested to try and narrow down the bug repeatability

Its OK on win ME and win 95 but both my win2k machines do have a problem.
Remote machines browsing display perfectly on all machines
IE 5.x (5.0 5.5 various patches) all work fine

&gt;<i>&quot;NS6&quot; won't handle the Xitami /Admin pages.... known bug, conflict with
</I>&gt;<i>some reserved word. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I know I reported it. It also works again in Ns 6.2 (I'm told) and 
latest mozillas

&gt;<i>&quot;NS6&quot; trashes &amp;...;-sequences when editing HTML in a textarea for
</I>&gt;<i>updating pages. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't use the editor in mozilla/NS6 at present. Complete pants would 
be my verdict

&gt;<i>Otherwise, in the &quot;NS6.1&quot; release, AOL's new toy is maybe not the worst
</I>&gt;<i>browser out there. But I still keep it on a tight leash.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed
