Apropos of which it's useful to understand just HOW Internet Explorer
handles downloads: despite the appearance of a dialogue box asking the
user to decide whereabouts to put the downloaded file, IE always
downloads the file into whatever is defined (in the Registry[1]) as the
place for &quot;Temporary Internet Files&quot;.  Only on completion of the download
is the file copied (or moved, if on the same volume) to the destination
selected by the user.

Supremely stupid behaviour (especially if the user knows that there is
insufficient space on the default TEMP volume and hopes to avoid running
out of space: vainly) but, hey!, that's Microsloth for you.

[1] I can't remember whether the TEMP environment variable can override
this, or whether it's vice versa.

    &quot;We can no longer stand apart from Europe if we would.  Yet we are
    untrained to mix with our neighbours, or even talk to them&quot;.
