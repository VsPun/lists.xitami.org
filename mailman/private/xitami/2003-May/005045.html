<PRE>I have noticed other servers doing something simular but they put the
[1] befor the extention where Xatimi puts it at the end.  I thought it
might be something with the temp folders also so I cleared out every
temp folder I could find and the downloaded programs folder and then
tried to download a file that I know I have not tried to download befor
and it still puts the [1] on the end.

This appended thing is common my experience from all kinds of sites.
Haven't figure out why.  Think it has something to do with how IE stores
the download in the Temporary folders before copying it to where you
want it. Deleting the brackets doesn't seem to hurt anything.  It's not
consistent enough to catch the pattern.  Possibility may be downloading
a file with a duplicate name in the Temp folders.

Just a thought
Charles
