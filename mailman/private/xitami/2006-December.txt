Hi Rick,

Though not an ftp guru, I suggest you alter your anon ftp message to reflect 
that there is none.
Just a thought as you do not seem to have any technical issues.

Subject: [Xitami] XML-file gives error "HTTP 404 not found"
Message-ID: <001c01c719e5$759df5c0$0400a8c0@pandora.be>

Hello,
 
If I open an XML-file on my http-server, I get the error "HTTP 404 not
found". In the log-file "console.txt" I get the error "xixxml: script
'file.gsl' not found for 'file.xml'".
 
Is it neccesary to make an gsl-file (do I have to use server-sided
XML-processing?)?
Or is it some general setting that has to be changed? Changing the
mimi-settings, doesn't make a difference.
 
If I open the XML-file on my ftp-server, it displays normally.
 
Can anyone help me please?
 
Thanks a lot!
Rachel.

you need to comment out (with a #) or delete the line "   .xml=xixxml"
in the [Wsx] section of your xitami.cfg file (in my version it is line
1261).

I found that the WinDoze binary works ok but the *nix files don't
compile for the reasons you state

You can fix the problems on the compile but it is a tedious business

If you are running *nix, let me know and I will put up a tarball for
you that should work on any *nix system

So is life sometimes. ?How do I fix the compile problems? I'm going to
assume for the moment that the file c contains a script that calls the
VC98\bin\cl.exe and that it translates the options shown to options
useful to your compiler.

I am having a problem with the PHP command fopen. I have upgraded to PHP

I am trying to display a jpg image using this

$fp = fopen($_CONF['path'] . 'plugins/captcha/images/static/' . $filename,

$filename is the name of the jpg.

Has anyone had any problems with fopen?

	This may be in an FAQ somewhere: I apologize if I am wasting
bandwidth and would welcome a pointer.
	I have used XITAMI on Windows, Linux, and AIX and prefer it to
APACHE and THTTPD.  I find it odd that the c script required for build
is never in the xi*gz archive files available for download from the
site.  I always have to find a sun*gz archive and extract the c script
to build xitami from source on linux or unix.  Why is that, and why has
it never been fixed?

I too have been wondering the same thing, so I decided to literally
follow the instructions on the developers page which state:

"All the tools you need are an ANSI C compiler, and other free
software you can download from www.iMatix.com ."

Well, I have an ANSI C compiler, several of them in fact, on both the
Windows and the BSD side of my machine. I went to the indicated site,
found the Downloads page and downloaded both copies of rbase. Guess
what? If you look in the boom sub-directory of either rbase archive
you will find the required "c" file. 8=)

No, it's not in any FAQ I could find either. As to why it is this way,
I don't know, perhaps an intelligence test for developers or perhaps a
way of separating the wanna-be's from the developers? To get the real
answer you'll have to ask the developers at Imatix. My personal
opinion is that the developers don't want you to compile just xitami
but want you to compile the entire rbase package in order to gain it's
advantages.
