I don't intend to do so, certainly not on the strength of a single
message.  Thomas has been very helpful to Xitami users on this list, and
with the expection of this one message all has other messages have been
about programs that work with Xitami, helping fill in the gaps between
what Xitami does and what users want to do (eg, use it with ColdFusion).

Obviously if there were continuing advertisements for a competing
webserver then it would be a cause for concern.  However a single
announcement of a new program that might be of use to users of an existing
program that isn't being updated is well within accepted netiquette
(based on a dozen or so years on the 'net).  

Thomas is right that Xitami really hasn't been maintained much (due to
lack of time) over the past few years -- IIRC the last minor update was
over a year ago, and the last major update was more than 2 years ago.
&gt;<i>From time to time there are plans to change this, but a lack of free
</I>time often gets in the way of such good plans.
