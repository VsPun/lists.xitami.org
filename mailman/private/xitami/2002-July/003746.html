Thomas is most welcome to announce ProtoNova on this list, although 
any extended discussion should probably move to a dedicated list. :)

Personally I welcome this announcement.  It offers Xitami users a 
choice, which is always good, and it offers Xitami some competition, 
which is good in a world where most web servers are too large and too 
complex for normal people.

I'm curious as to whether Thomas used any Xitami code in the server, 
or whether 'brand new' means written from scratch.  Thomas, you might 
want to explain your decision to start something new rather than add 
or improve the existing body of code.  Just for interest.  Also, is 
your server open source, or closed?

Then, what do you mean by 'a fraction of the price'?  Xitami/Pro is 
not expensive at $99.  Far too cheap, really, since it does not even 
start to pay its way.  What does ProtoNova cost?

Lastly, and this is for the record, Xitami *is* supported, if slowly, 
and will continue to be part of the iMatix toolset for as long as 
iMatix exists, which I intend to be a long time.  Providing open 
source products just happens to be very time consuming, and time is 
something that growing businesses are always short of.

Thomas, I think we can continue this discussion on the Xitami list 
for a little while.
