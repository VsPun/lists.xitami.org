&gt;<i>Ok ran a netstat -s to check.  FTPD is only using 21 and Xitami is
</I>listening to 80 and 81.  
&gt;<i>Here is a common error befor a crash: 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No such file or directory
</I>
Xitami could not find the file or directory to load.  Sounds like the FTP
server is doing some sort of caching it shouldn't...or Windows could be
corrupted or Xitami is corrupted or something is not right.

&gt;<i>Broken pipe
</I>
Possibly a further result of the file not opening.  My guess here is that
Xitami is attempting to use a file or socket anyway.  At this point there
is trouble later on whatever the case is.

&gt;<i>Socket operation on non-socket
</I>
The client socket has been closed or we are accessing memory we don't own...

&gt;<i>Clean-memory assertion failed - xitami.c (208)
</I>
This is (strangely) located at the end of Xitami's execution in main().
I'm surprised the program got that far.  However, it is due to Xitami
attempting to use or access memory it doesn't own or no longer owns.
Xitami appears to be on its way out the door to avoid that great core dump
in the skies whatever the case is.

&gt;<i>Abnormal program termination
</I>
It looks like the program exited but then the CPU took over and realized a
memory fault took place during the clean-memory scan.

&gt;<i>core dumped
</I>
Hence, the core dump.  So much for avoiding it...

&gt;<i>Any of this make sense?
</I>
Nope.  Just extrapolating on what seems to be taking place.

There should be no problem here.  Any Windows sockets provider worth its
salt will only allow one program to own a single port on one IP at one
time.  So, if there are two server programs contending for the same port,
only one gets it.

This could be, but with Windows you never know what the OS will decide to
do next :)  (I'm not an advocate of any OS...I just haven't found any that
I really like).

Hope this helps!
