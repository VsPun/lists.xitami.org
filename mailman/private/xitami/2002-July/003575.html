<PRE>You can't do it yourself, unless you order a static IP from RoadRunner.
But, that might be expensive (don't know, never checked the price).  So,
instead,  you can go with an IP forwarding service like www.dns2go.com .
You point your URL (with your domain provider (or just use
www.yourdomain.dns2go.com for free)) to dns2go (They will tell you the DNS
IPs).  Then, you run  their client software on your server that updates
dns2go with your current IP.  Then dns2go re-directs all domain requests to
your current IP.

There is one more problem, however.  RoadRunner blocks port 80 (standard
html port).  So you have to tell Xitami to run your webserver at a port like
6800 or something (read how in the Xitami docs).  You also have to tell the
dns2go client software to portforward requests with a www. prefix to
whatever port you use.  And, bring your FTP port back down to 20 (see Xitami
docs).

Then, your html URL will be www.yourdomain.com and your FTP URL will be
<A HREF="ftp://yourdomain.com">ftp://yourdomain.com</A> .  You have to use the www. prefix or dns2go will not
know to portforward html requests to your new html port (6800 or whatever
you picked), and you have to make sure not to use it with FTP requests, or
dns2go will portforward those to the same port as your webserver.

Its all free (and pretty transparent) unless you want email.  Then they
charge a bit.

Good Luck,

- Jay

Subject: [Xitami] Dynamic IP to Static IP


Hello! There,

I have installed xitami-2.4d7 under linux at home network with cable(rr) and
3Com-3C510.
I like to change my dynamic IP to static IP. Being new to NW I don't know
how and where.
I can not locate any document.

Appreciated if you can point me to the right direction.
Thanks,
Myint
