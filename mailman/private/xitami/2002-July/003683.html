&gt;<i>How do you know that this is the reason for crashing your server?
</I>
Well, when I get the message that Xitami crashed, this always seems to be
the last entry in the log around the time that it happend.

&gt;&gt;<i>From the log record it seems that the request has been handled well with the
</I>&gt;<i>404 error.
</I>&gt;<i>I suggest you dig somewhere else for the real problem. What does the
</I>&gt;<i>xi??????.log say.
</I>
The most recent log is xi020714 and it contains the following:

 2/07/14  1:44:58: smthttp: preparing for connections on port 80
 2/07/14  1:44:58: smthttp: ready for HTTP connections on port 80
 2/07/14  1:44:58: smthttp: accepting connections on 192.168.1.200
 2/07/14  1:44:58: smthttp: accepting connections on 127.0.0.1
 2/07/14 19:27:52: smthttp: preparing for connections on port 80
 2/07/14 19:27:52: smthttp: ready for HTTP connections on port 80
 2/07/14 19:27:52: smthttp: accepting connections on 192.168.1.200
 2/07/14 19:27:52: smthttp: accepting connections on 127.0.0.1

Nothing there looks odd to me.


&gt;<i>Does xitami crash within seconds after handling these requests?
</I>
I don't know the exact time after, but each time I check the log, there is
what looks like the code red attack.

Is there any place else to check for anything? I'm new to the program and a
bit lost now as to what is happening.

Thanks!

Mike
