<PRE>it is an arcane science, akin to alchemy, getting listed in the engines.
There are folks who will charge you money to do it but here there are 2 esy
ways, aside from the meta-tag and wait method.

1) make firends with the appropriate category editor at dmoz.org, the Open
Directory Project.  Once a site is in there (well, after a couple weeks) it
get's populated to all the sites that license the directory.  Categories are
edited by volunteers.  If there isn't someone for your category, volunteer
yourself.

2) sign up for Lycos's InSite service which get's you into their version of
the FAST catalog, and will also give you a search utility to run on your
site.  There are other services, but an independant survey found lycos to be
the best for the money.

3) go to searchenginewatch.com and read up on it... many many strategies
there.

good luck

Subject: [Xitami] Site listing for search engines




  Hello all,

  I am having problems getting my site listed in the major search engines.
Even with free sites like Geocities, I was able to at least be listed in
Google.  Is it because the search engines look at sites hosted on your own
computer (with Xitami), differently than sites hosted in other ways?  Any
help or advice would be appreciated!  I have gone to great lengths to
compile meta tags, and title indexes.  I know of people who don't even use
meta tags, or go to any effort to list their sites, yet they are listed way
up in them, and it has just gotten frustrating to me.. Thank and I hope
everyone is doing well!  have a good day.

  PS:  Would someone send (to my email address), the exact link that I need
to use to come read, and post to this list online, without reading and
posting through my email service?  I &quot;just&quot; now realized that I do not get
many posts to my email, like other lists!  Only very few actually come
there!  Thanks all!

   John - {dummy}
