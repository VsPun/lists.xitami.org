<PRE>OK...now I am getting frustrated. I keep getting an error from Xitami
(running on Win2K with SP2) that shuts down Xitami and tells me that an
error message/log has been created. But, it does not seem to do that. I
look at the errors.log that is dated that day. However, the last entry is
at a little before 1:30pm and the error was created at approximately
8:20pm. Am I looking in the right place for the error notifications? This
is really frustrating to me. I'd like to find out the cause and stop it.

Also, is there a way to gracefully recover from this type of problem? I
know there is a recovery setting in Xitami and I have &quot;checked&quot; that
option...but it does not seem to do a damn thing for me.

Any help at all for a newbie would be MUCH appreciated!

Michael
