If I'm not mistaken what your asking is 'Where do I put the files'.  There is a folder at 'C:\XITAMI\WEBPAGES'.  You can get rid of everything inside the folder and put your stuff there.  Thats it for files.

As to logging in from a library and seeing yourself, you'll have to know your public side IP#.  To you it may look like 127.0.0.1, to the outside world you look like '213.52.0.1'.  I put up a little tool that you use to find your public side IP# at <A HREF="http://yumyum.ws/ipplayground.php">http://yumyum.ws/ipplayground.php</A>  Just go there on your server machine and write down your number.  Remeber each time you log off and back on the internet this public side IP# will change.  You can't trust what a program called 'WINIPCFG.EXE' says is your IP#/  Your ISP maybe doing some funky stuff to keep you from running a server.

Other little tidbits about webservers in general:
	127.0.0.1 and the words localhost are the same thing to a computer.
	If want to play around with your setting type in '<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/admin'">http://127.0.0.1/admin'</A>
	Xitami does not do most server side scripting when you install it.  Your have to install things like PHP and Cold Fushion
	Windows based webservers don't care about case(uppercase and lowercase) on file names.  Example: <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/MYFile.htm">http://127.0.0.1/MYFile.htm</A> is the same as <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/myfile.htm">http://127.0.0.1/myfile.htm</A> to a Windows based webserver.  Unix and Linux servers are not so forgiving.  Remember that if your going to put these files onto another server watch your case.

Hello, let me introduce myself. I am a web designer
(strictly client-side) and I have recently downloaded the
Xitami package onto my Gateway 20000, which runs
under Windows 98.I know almost nothing about the
server-side aspect of things, but ya gotta start somewhere,
and nearly everything I know I have learned the hard
way, so.... here I go again!

The main reason I got Xitami was to give myself a home
workshop where I can begin learning the mysteries of
CGI, PHP,SQL...etc,etc.....(I don't plan to become a web host
any time in the near future!)

As far as I can tell, the installation was successful. I did the
PING thing on the DOS command line and it works dandy.
The Xitami icon appears in the tool bar just as it should,
and I can follow the various steps and get to the Admin
screen, etc. When Xitami is turned on, I am able to access
127.0.01 via IE6, otherwise... no go. I believe that's how it
should be, yes?

Naturally, I have 10,000 neophyte questions, but I shall limit
myself. At this point I'd like to accomplish one
concrete, significant goal. I would like to install an elementary
web document just for testing purposes, and log onto it from the
public library. Just to make it happen; to prove that it can be
done. That's all. Nothin' fancy.

Once I've got that down pat, I will feel that I've passed a meaningful
milestone, and can profitably turn my attention to whatever comes
next. Can anybody on this list steer me down the right road
with a few brief and crystal-clear directives (taking into account
my prior knowledge, which is close to zero.)?

I shall be thankful.../
