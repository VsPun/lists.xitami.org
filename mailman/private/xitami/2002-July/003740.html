<PRE>Due to the fact that many people here using the Xitami webserver are
looking for alternatives to Xitami since it no longer is a supported web
server (by the parent company iMatix), Shining Light Productions has
written a brand new web server called ProtoNova.

ProtoNova features:

  SSL/TLS support (with a simple-to-use SSL certificate generation system!)
  Normal HTTP/1.1 support
  Remote module support (moves heavy-duty processing off of the main server)
  A CGI remote module
  A LRWP remote module (allows you to directly move all current LRWP
applications to ProtoNova without recompiling!)
  A ColdFusion remote module (uses technology from XiFusion!)
  Database driven logs via ODBC (no log files!)
  Symbolic links
  Aliases
  Virtual hosting
  Multiple server support (multiple servers on multiple ports using one
application instance)
  Works &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;
  Secure &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;
  Extremely small footprint (runs on 16-32MB machines just fine...remote
modules can be used to dump the real workload onto better machines).
  ... And much, much more!


ProtoNova is a natural move from Xitami that offers server farm,
load-balancing, and clustering capabilities for a fraction of the price of
Xitami/Pro.  Also, while maintaining ease-of-use, the power of many
commercial servers can be found in simple, sensible configuration files.
Servers and virtual hosts can be brought on and offline without ever
stopping the server (the server detects the configuration change and loads
it up), which results in uptimes that can potentially exceed most (all?)
other web servers.

(Right now ProtoNova is only for Windows in a console, but eventually other
ports will become available.  The first port will be a Linux
port...probably RedHat).

Check out the ProtoNova Web Server today!


Note to XiFusion users:  XiFusion is still supported by Shining Light
Productions as it is a fairly popular freeware product.  However, the limit
to which XiFusion can be updated is quickly coming to a close (both OS and
calling process limitations are constantly arising).  Xitami is poorly
designed in the CGI arena and needs serious re-working to get rid of the
DoS/DDoS attack that still affects it.  ProtoNova is a viable alternative
that avoids the CGI DoS that plagues Xitami.  CGIs also seem to run faster
under ProtoNova...probably due to the method of handling the data pump and
having true HTTP/1.1 support.

ProtoNova is just one more way that Shining Light Productions is &quot;Meeting
the Needs of Fellow Programmers!&quot;
