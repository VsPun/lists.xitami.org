&gt;<i>I've just received the following strange e-mail, claiming that a message

</I>
You're not alone.  I've received several of them as well.

&gt;<i>Can the list owner confirm, or otherwise, that the purported sender of this 
</I>&gt;<i>mail is a subscriber to the list?
</I>
He is not a subscriber under the address in question.  There is a
subscriber under an address which I suspect forwards to that address.

If these &quot;deleted unread&quot; messages continue to arrive then I'll probably
remove that &quot;likely candidate&quot; and advise them they've been removed
until they can confirm their mail system isn't the cause of the
messages.

&gt;<i>[for those of us that run our own smtpd] nor collected by POP3, then it
</I>&gt;<i>will be bounced back to the originator [as required by RFC-[2]821] after
</I>&gt;<i>30 days.  But surely this notification is insufficient to comply with
</I>&gt;<i>that sort of bounce mandated by the RFC?)
</I>
Any such bounce message should probably be omitted for Precedence: bulk
and other similar &quot;mailing list&quot; messages anyway.  (I've not checked
the RFCs recently but I suspect they say something similar.)  At very
least they should be sent to the mailing list software, not anywhere
else.

Anyway I am aware of the issue, and the message someone else posted that
it was being investigated.  There will be a small grace period to fix
the issue, and if not I'll do what I can at the mailing list end to
minimise the problem.   (However the &quot;deleted unread&quot; messages appear to
relate to old messages already &quot;received&quot;, and bypass the mailing list,
so there is a limit to what I can do.)
