I once ran postnuke (a phpnuke descendant) with xitami 3.4d9 and php 4.0.5 
without any problems. Don't understand why I should need XiFusion or 
something. BTW, I think there is too much advertising for this and some 
other products on this list (apart from Xitami of course).
There were indeed some problems, but they were all implementation-related 
and could most often be found in the  various discussion boards and 
buglist. Especially the redirection problem, which is a known bug (has been 
half a year ago, I wonder that it still is) which, as far as I recall, 
stems from an incorrect use of the php redirect function, namely usage of 
relative paths in the redirect which is not conformant with the HTTP 
specification.
_Maybe_ Apache with compiled-in php _corrects_ this improper use. I don't know.
But apart from that (looking at the code of nuke) I can't see any relation 
to the actual webserver used.
BTW, in my opinion, there is no reason to think that any php product 
whatsoever depends on the webserver in use.
