Subject: [Xitami] runat comand in xitami.
Message-ID: <484613C9.6020107@bellsouth.net>

Hi All

Dose the "runat server" command work in Xitami? I have an "hta" file 
that I would like to us to query a "dbf" file. I changed the "<script 
language="VBScript" >" to "<script language="VBScript" runat="SERVER">" 
. Ran it in my cgi-bin. That did not work, but no error message was 
displayed.

Is this an XP problem?
Is it a Xitami problem?
Is it a code problem?

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks from Jeff McDonald

Message-ID: <48461D17.20603@bellsouth.net>

Hi All

In trying to fix my vbscript problem. I found 2 open source programs 
that script in basic as a cgi code. Both say they run under windows and 
Linux.

Webbasic here.: http://www.ddginc-usa.com/webbas.htm

Webbasic said it runs under xitami in both windows and Linux. The 2 file 
types that it uses are ".b" a ".bas" like file and ".htb" a  html and 
basic file like an ".asp" page. I would love to see this work. It would 
make xitami look like it had it's on asp style.

Scriptbasic here.: http://www.scriptbasic.com/html/index.html

Scriptbasic runs ".bas" files and also has an Application Engine. I 
think the Application Engine may need appachee to work.

Thanks

 > basic as a cgi code

ANY DOS/Win program (likewise anything executable under unix) can be run 
as a CGI.

Most won't do much good/useful stuff; you need to know CLI interface and 
how to mesh with GCI.

...\Xitami\webpages\xitami\INDEX5.HTM

As noted there, even a dumb old .BAT file can CGI (though this is very 
awkward because half the BAT syntax overlaps HTML syntax).

My first CGI was a "hello world" BAT file; my second was a 
QuickBasic-for-DOS "hello world" EXE file. I then coded a whole filter 
with database lookup in QuickBasic4.5 (for DOS!) running as a CGI.

Some minor hammering because QB does not by default work on streams, 
also it had a 64K chunk-limit. I found instructions to hack Visual Basic 
fer Windows (which has larger limits) to omit the GUI and work on 
streams; that was my main CGI for years. The overhead of calling a 224KB 
EXE file (which did dumb linear searches in an unindexed datafile) was 
never a problem even on P-133MHz.

I think my form-submission CGI process is -still- a DOS BAT file calling 
various mail functions and ECHOing back the confirmation... yeah:

@echo off
@ mail -s "Form Return" suzie at school.edu <  ~~~ 
c:\webpages\%FORM_FOLDER%\%FORM_FILENAME%.txt >>mail.logger
@ type c:\webpages\%FORM_FOLDER%\%FORM_FILENAME%.txt >> ~~~
c:\webpages\%FORM_FOLDER%\%FORM_FILENAME%.log

Don't over-think, over-design, or get into strange little solutions.

OTOH, unless you are married to BASIC, Perl and PHP run under Xitami. 
PHP has one function, coded to an Apache quirk/flaw, which bombs under 
Xitami; otherwise it is sweet. Perl and PHP have library functions which 
make hard-work in old BASIC too-easy. (VBscript may do more... but then 
why not go all-the-way and use MS IIS server?)

...if they write to standard output. Turbo Pascal programs, for example 
(yeah old), have some own routines for that and cannot be used to run 
CGI -- they must be wrapped in a batch file (!) for that to work. So, 
strange workarounds may be needed.

At this point in time, CGI and SSIs -- once used most everywhere -- 
would /be/ the strange little solution. ;-)

Yes, PHP is great, but the overhead of starting up a PHP process for 
every page reload is /very/ significant. Apache with PHP as a module 
absolutely smokes Xitami, despite Xitami being much faster for static 
content.

Xitami allow input/output files instead of stdin/stdout, making Xitami
more easy to use than any other webserver. Get the file name via the
environment: ENVIRON$("CGI_STDIN")
And basic is not dead, don't focus on old QuickBasic (or visual basic)

program in any basic dialect, go for it!

Don't forget Environ("CGI_STDOUT") and Environ("QUERY_STRING")! Checking for
these at the start of the app is a good indication if it IS being started by
Xitami as CGI or as an unknowning user!

FWIW, all of my CGI applications are written in VB6 and range from basic
enquiry forms to fully blown admin panels linking to MySQL databases and
doing other wizzy stuff that would just be a pain in PHP/Perl/etc. Yea ok,
the overheads of VB is critised as being heavily "code bloated" - but who
REALLY cares when your current webservers are dual dual-core Xeon monsters
with oodles of memory?! I know in the back of my mind that the life of
Xitami is finite and I really should switch to PHP - but I'm yet to find a
reason other than this to switch!

A good one for debugging is to create a single BATch file in your cgi-bin
with a single line:

SET

Returns all the environment variables in one swoop and shows you whats
available to play with!

I made my first CGI program in 1999, using my "first" Web Server Xitami 
and using Xitami docs to learn.
The language was Clipper (16 bits) using Xitami in Win98, but shortly 32 
bits systems (Win2000, .. OS/2) killed this option

Since then Xitami continue as my "development Web server" in daily 
basis, in Win32, OS/2, Linux
I continue using Clipper language, but in 32 bits with (x)Harbour in 
Win32, OS/2, Linux, with support of DBF/CDX/..., Advantage Database 
Server and MySQL and others
Same code in any platform

Who need PHP/ASP/Perl/TCL/Delphi/VB/NET/etc ?   :-)

Performance of (x)Harbour with Xitami, Apache, IIS, ..., is excelent
... and Xitami is fastest/reliable in any case

You're right Paul! Back on track...

I'm not too sure what Jeff is trying to do though. Going back to the
original message, I'm guessing your DBF resides on the server and you're
wanting to query it for the purpose of displaying it's content on your site?
If this is the case, I think you might be going about it the wrong way:

HTA's were Microsoft's way (starting back in the days of IE5) of turning
'regular' HTM files into basic client-side applications. As far as I know -
they're not really used for server-side scripting. MSDN has an interesting
overview of what HTAs are and why on earth you would want to use them
located here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536496(VS.85).aspx.
You may remember that these were all the rage for a while with some vendors
even using them to create 'wizzy' autorun applications (that suffered from a
million and one security violations - I wonder why they never took off?!!)

Also, HTA's (whilst strictly speaking are just .html's renamed to .hta) do
add some additional tag's to the html language. However, it doesn't modify
existing tags. The <SCRIPT> tag remains unaffected and so doesn't add any
RUNAT functionality (check out w3schools for a good reference for this tag
here: http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_script.asp)


I'm guessing though that you've already got a HTA that queries your DBF? If
so, could you paste the VBScript so that we could take a look? (just
segments if necessary please!)

Cheers,
Stuart

Out of interest, (after suffering myself from Xitami dying every now and
again under Win2k3 server), have you installed Xitami as a service on this
box? ("xisrv32 -install"). If so, check the properties of the service
(funnily enough, Microsoft allowed for the eventuality that services might
stop responding and die!!). Check out the properties of the Xitiami service
and look in the 'Recovery' tab. Simply change the First Failure, Second
Failure and Subsequent Failures to 'Restart Service' (hell - why not?!)

One other thing that helped me an awful lot was the "recover=" parameter in
xitami.cfg. Not quite sure of the mileage in this one though.

PS. As for dead HD's - you've got yourself a bad one if it's only from 2003!
Mind you, was there a drive on the market in 2003 big enough to hold a

you ask? Because it's full of: "Do you want to do this?" "Yes" "Do you

I am running 2.4d9 on a Windows 2k3 advanced server, prior to that the same 
version was running on W2K Server - on both OSs I rarely ever encountered 
Xitami hangs or service reloads.  And most of thhose were the CGI 
interpreter causing Perl errors (typically due to server load issues) that 
would knock things off line.

However, I do have the 'auto-restart' option enabled in the Xitami .cfg file 
and I also have the the Windows Service set to restart in case of a service 
hang/failure.  But for the most part, my Xitami logs go months before they 
are recylced due to a service restart.  If anything, the majority of my 
problems were related to Windows OS itself hanging and causing a system 
reboot.

wish I could help?  Runs flawless here on many flavors???
I would suggest just running a XP box or a Linux box and dedicate it to 
the cause.

Subject: [Xitami] VISTA, crashes, etc.
Message-ID: <000b01c8c7c7$effc0730$6401a8c0@Gary>

I have Xitami running on several machines at several locations.  All but one
are running XP sp2.  The exception is running VISTA.  I get a rare crash at
all but one site.  That site is the most stable and I don't have a clue why.
It is running a raid drive array (the only site that does) so that might be
the reason.

Most of my CGI processes are written in VB 6 sp2.  I do have a few BATs that
do utility things like back-ups and kick of sessions in a database that
supports this feature.  All that works exceptionally well.  I use Xitami
for more than just web sites.  It is the server that puts in nTier in my
network.  I have my home grown server that operates as a fileserver and I
use that on ports other than 80.  The reason I use Ximati for a fileserver
enabler is that some of my user's company policy does not allow a tunnel
through their firewall for any other port.  Besides, Ximati works so well
for that it's hard to ignore it.

All the above brings me to my point.  Since an unrecovered crash is so bad
for me, I just wrote a VB routine to access the site via winhttp ever
minute.  If it fails to get a response it will become visual, warn the
person using the machine that it will reboot in 1 minute.  If the user does
not abort the reboot it reboots and Xitami restarts on the reboot.  I don't
attempt to clear the error nor restart Xitami, it's just cleaner to reboot.
I have the option to have it send me a text message to my cell phone to tell
me.

If anyone would like to have a copy of the VB executablable I'll modify it
(right now I hardcode the url) so that you can configure it for the url you
want checked.  Just let me know and I'll do the mod and post it to my
website.

I'm running the xigui32.exe. I had issues with running it as a service. I
don't think I have the auto recover option enabled. Maybe that's why others
don't seem to have a problem. I will check that. 


Actually I just looked at the drive and it's a 60gb dated 2001 and all it
had on it was the web server and everything that went with the web server
like mySQL, PHP, Webalizer etc. Now I have a 500gb for the main drive, a
120gb, two 320gb external USB drives and two 320gb Network drives. I
restored the web server from backup and it's backed up to one of the network
drives. The 120gb is almost full of...well... JUNK! One of the 320 Network
drives is almost full of all the backups of the other drives and my wife's
computer.

Out of interest, (after suffering myself from Xitami dying every now and
again under Win2k3 server), have you installed Xitami as a service on this
box? ("xisrv32 -install"). If so, check the properties of the service
(funnily enough, Microsoft allowed for the eventuality that services might
stop responding and die!!). Check out the properties of the Xitiami service
and look in the 'Recovery' tab. Simply change the First Failure, Second
Failure and Subsequent Failures to 'Restart Service' (hell - why not?!)

One other thing that helped me an awful lot was the "recover=" parameter in
xitami.cfg. Not quite sure of the mileage in this one though.

Cheers,

PS. As for dead HD's - you've got yourself a bad one if it's only from 2003!
Mind you, was there a drive on the market in 2003 big enough to hold a

Well after a few days of fighting, turning off security features, another
bad hard drive and shear persistence things seem to be running fairly
smoothly. Xitami still dumps from time to time but Always Up turns it back
on.  Hard telling what the bad hard drive was causing but dumps seem to
happen less often.  Funny these drives don't last forever.LOL. I think this
one goes back to 2003 or farther. 

 

Anyway back in business,

I pulled back to version 2.4 and it solved the crash problems I was having
on VISTA.

The basic problem with VISTA is the security "enhancements".  I have to
disable most of the new enhancements to use VISTA.

VISTA, crashes, etc.What 'user' are you referring to?  The way it reads is that any user accessing the site, the first one to see the message has the option to abort your reboot or allow it to happen...can you clarify that?  That sounds a tad unsecure.

With all that effort, why not just use your script to stop and restart the Xitami service - if it doesn't recover after that, then have the system reboot. 9 out of 10 times, a service restart fixes the problem - its quicker, cleaner and less intrusive.

Says to me that he runs the webserver in the background on a workstation 
which may have a colleague *sitting at it*.

Back in the late 1980s, I ran servers in workstations. A 286 can do 
NetWare 2 and WordStar at the same time. And you could rig it so NW 
errors did, or did-not, get posted to the screen for the user's 
attention. At home I often ran Xitami just for local uses.

I suspect that a dedicated machine is usually a better plan than a 
user-workstation. Users tend to flog windows (yes, and unixes) into a 
jam once a month, while my server-only machines run many months.

OTOH, if a machine has a regular user, and the power blips or a re-start 
stalls, the user will do something (kick it, hard restart, or call 
Gary). One of my low-use unattended machines was down for a day and I 
didn't know.

 > 9 out of 10 times, a service restart fixes the problem

In NT4 and up, yes, service restart usually clears the problem. (I don't 
know Vista.)

You said WordStar - you're my hero.  People often ask me what got me started 
in computers, and routinely point out my first days on a computer using 
WordStar.  Most have no idea what it is or what it was.  But I can honestly 
say that using WordStar (a summer job doing word processing (I could type 
fast) for a company that took printed federal regulations codes and put them 
on disk for gov't contractors) got me familiar with keyboard interaction and 
more importantly a fundamental understanding of coding.  WordStar is almost 
like HTML in a sense where ".b blah blah blah blah .b" would bold the line 
(or what ever the syntax was), it was those kind of associations that 
literally made something in my mind go "click: ah I get it!" and then after 
that I sought out Pascal to begin teaching myself programming.

18 years later I am an accomplished sr level network engineer, routinely 
program in JS/PHP/Perl/MySQL etc, run my own web based businesses.  All of 
which is self taught (as I was a History major in college) and I still smile 
when some one asks how I got started in computers.  I grin with a bit of 
fondness as I answer: "WordStar"

ah, the memories.  :-)

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami redirect function
Message-ID: <002901c8c743$18380580$1401a8c0@p4>

I've been trying to figure out how to use the redirect function as described 
in the xitami.cfg file, but just do not understand the explanation on how to 
use it.  Up til now I've been using java to do my redirects, but java seems 
to have a problem in returning to the previous URL after the redirect.
So far, I can get Xitami to redirect a page I created in C:\xitami\webpages 
by creating a [redirect] section to defaults.cfg and adding line to it like 
so:  /mypage.html = http://www.somewhere.com , but I cannot get it to 
redirect the same file (mypage.html) if I place it in any other folder or 
virtual domain. I use a lot of cgi, and do not use php. Can someone give me 
an example on how this should be done in Xitami? Thanks....... JR

Yes,please.
I thought to be one of the few still using xitami, at leasr in this part of the world...
I use DBMax (an xBase dialecr) as scripting language for xitami, and I run xitami on several sites (two are expecially large) since 2001,

Now I moved to Vista, using a virtual machine (VMWare) running XP FLP and I'm QUITE satisfied! It really shines.

Thank you in advance
