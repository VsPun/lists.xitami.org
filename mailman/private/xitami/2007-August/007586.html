Russel,

You didn't mention if you are using PHP or some other scripting 
language, but I'm not aware of any method to query a MySQL database 
without one.  Scripting languages under Xitami typically require CGI.

When CGI runs like that, the CPU gets hammered because you've got new 
processes being created left and right.  The system is spending most of 
its time starting up and shutting down processes.

I ran a similar test spread across 15 machines on a LAN once with Xitami 
via CGI and got similar results (I wrote my own tool).  Xitami simply 
couldn't handle the load.  Most of the time it just returned blank 
pages.  I don't know what tool you are using but socket code fails if 
you mass connect to a server in rapid succession (Windows hangs onto 
socket handles until TCP closes down cleanly or times out)...for my 
test, I wrote a tool to manage the process and just retried the 
connection on failure (i.e. it is almost always the client that fails to 
connect because all sockets are in use).  Keep in mind that this test 
was many years ago, so I've forgotten a lot of the details but from what 
you've described, you're running into many of the same issues I ran into.

I do seem to recall the web document root getting flooded with bogus 
files from stdin/stdout.  Search the Xitami archives and there should be 
a warning from me about a DDoS issue with CGI support in Xitami.  I 
remember looking at the source code to CGI support to see how it would 
need to be fixed and something about incorrect filename selection was 
the cause of bogus files and the blank pages (i.e. too many requests in 
too short of a time resulted in lousy/incorrect filename selection). 
Also because the files are in the web root, it is conceivable that 
security is drastically reduced (i.e. someone could remotely gain access 
to passwords/credit card info/etc).

In theory, if you are using PHP, you should be able to drastically 
improve performance and security by using Xitami LRWP, multiple 
instances of the ISAPI LRWP daemon (isapid - probably still a 'beta'), 
and the ISAPI PHP module.  Then, in your PHP code, use persistent 
connections to the MySQL database (i.e. mysql_pconnect()).  LRWP, IMO, 
is a weak protocol - it can only handle one request at a time.  For the 
load you describe, 10-12 instances of the ISAPI LRWP daemon will 
probably be sufficient.  The server will still be hammered but should be 
able to handle the load.
