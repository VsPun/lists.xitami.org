Well I want to thank you for your advice.

But it seems that whatever I do I cannot get xitami to compile correctly or
even in fact compile at all.

I had already imported the ``c'' file from the 2.5b5 version and also
imported what libraries I could find although I was unable to find libstu.a
and libaxc.a and additionally made the build.sh file, plus the boomake and
makefiles executable. I also tried the ``c'' file that you recommended with
no better results.

The build script build.sh seems to go through the motions finally abandoning
the attempt with ''can't find xitami'' after hundreds of warnings.

I next tried modifying the build script to remove the openssl and xipro
directory references and which didn't seem to be created upon untarring the
tarball.  That did not correct the situation.

So I tried compiling the various directories without using the build.sh
file.

These are my findings:

In sfl, (standard function library) ./boomake build  produces a file
``-g.lst'' which simply  contains ``gcc: no input files''

Having deleted ``-g.lst'', ``./c *.c'' actually produces the object files
and ``./boomake build install'' appears to work and in fact sets up the
/usr/local/imatix directory and transfers over some files. Whether all the
requisite files are installed I do not know, but I was hopeful at this stage
although there were numerous bitches as follows:
egrep -g.c No such file or directory
compiling -g
cat: invalid option -g

Anyway moving on to GSL, following the same procedure ``./c *.c'' gave a
multitude of errors and I abandoned the project.

I would like to run the latest version. But at least 2.5b5 runs perfectly
and I can always fall back on apache/proftpd if the need should ever arise.
