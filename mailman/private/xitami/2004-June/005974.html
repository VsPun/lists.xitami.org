<PRE>Hi James,

Thanks for that advice - I ended up going with Apache in the end but
Thomas' advice was very handy in setting up the hosts file and I'm
working fine now at home. 

I would like to run a local copy of Apache though at work also now I
have this working at home so everyone can upload and view pages locally
before syncing them with the server. I will have a go using your example
on the peered network. We're out in Russia at the moment and the high
bandwidth costs are making us much more careful than we were previously
in the UK! 

I don't quite understand though how a user on our network here
'switches' between the local intranet and the internet generally. At
home I have now configured virtual hosts so that when I type in
domain.com I arrive at the site as per normal - would the users here
type IP numbers instead? I know this isn't a Xitami question though so I
would quite understand if you don't answer.


Best regards,

Nick

Hi Nick

Thomas gave you good advice for a lone pc. If  you are useing a peer to
peer
network and need the sites to be seen by all network peers. you should
use
the ip for your network interface card not the 127.0.0.1 loopback ip. I
copy
a master host file to all the pc's in our network.

sample..................................................................

#IP Address     Name                  Comments

127.0.0.1          localhost              #Loop back IP/Name

192.168.0.0     desk1                    #Default IP &amp; Names
192.168.0.1     desk2                    #Default IP &amp; Names
192.168.0.2     desk3                    #Default IP &amp; Names
192.168.0.3     desk4                    #Default IP &amp; Names
192.168.0.4     desk5                    #Default IP &amp; Names
192.168.0.5     desk6                    #Default IP &amp; Names

192.168.0.0     company.frim       #In house IP &amp; Names
192.168.0.0     company.com       #In house IP &amp; Names
192.168.0.5     company.web       #In house IP &amp; Names
127.0.0.1         testthis.test           #Local test site
