It does have a fairly low memory footprint; about 2MB (at least under
Linux) when it is running. Possible more like 3MB or so under Windows.

&gt;<i>Current situation:
</I>&gt;<i>With &quot;system monitor&quot; w98 reports about 84Megs allocated, but this is

</I>
You're _way_ over committed on your memory for only 28MB of real memory.  
I'm not surprised you're getting fairly poor performance.

&gt;<i>Why on earth would xitami (the only programming 'running') be
</I>&gt;<i>allocating memory and freeing memory so often?
</I>
Xitami does have various &quot;background&quot; &quot;threads&quot; which handle various
things which do allocate memory while they're working.  They should be
doing it constantly, but given that you're so massively overcommitted on
your memory, it doesn't surprise me that the whole thing is thrashing.

Seriously: memory is pretty cheap these days.  Even if you need 72pin
SIMMs, they're no where near as expensive as they once were (albeit much
more expensive than generic SDRAM is).
