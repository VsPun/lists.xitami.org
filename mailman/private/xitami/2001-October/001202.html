Unfortunately, Alvaro, I think you are wrong on several counts here.  First, 
there is nothing better for promoting small businesses around the world 
than making a cost-efficient server that has SSL.  I would have to say that, 
as a business owner, SSL has greater benefits than just selling products 
and services on the internet.  For example, it serves as a venue by which 
our company can pass secure information back and forth between us and 
our clients.  As for remote administration, I am sure you are aware that the 
server does have its own remote web-based server administration.  On the 
other hand, if it had the capability to incorporate the Microsoft Server 
Extensions, I would have to agree with you.

</I>
Alvaro, I think you are confusing me as being representative of Imatix.  Like 
you, I am one of their customers.  Nonetheless, I would have to counter 
your presumption with one of my own:  people DO use the Xitami server for 
multiple reasons, one of the most prevalent is that it IS free.  There are 
other equally comprehensive, if not more comprehensive, web servers that 
are marketed in the lower cost ranges.  A good example off the top of my 
head would be O'Reilly's web server.  As a matter of course, O'Reilly's 
server, at last reference, has both SSL and incorporates MS Server 
Extensions.  If you are thoroughly displeased with Xitami, perhaps you 
should opt for this alternative.  On the other hand, for rapid installation, I 
have to admit that O'Reilly's server has a considerable learning curve on the 
installation, as opposed to Xitami.

&gt;<i> 3.) I would also guess that the majority of the people who want an
</I>&gt;<i> easy to install/use server are NOT IT PROFFESSIONALS.  My guess is
</I>&gt;<i> that many of them do not know how to program, and just want the easy
</I>&gt;<i> to use Web Admin screens, and not the config files for configuration.
</I>
Admittedly, Xitami's Help files are poorly written.  In most cases they are
written as if the first-time user is to know the intricacies of editing the config
files.  After uttering that last line, those of you who are techies can obviously
see that I am one of those jaded Windows users.  We are the ones who are
accustomed to the pamperings of &quot;wizards&quot; and other helper applications/files.
 *NIX users are familiar with the processes of customizing usability through
the config files in everything they do.  Therefore, it is not accurate of you to
say that ALL Xitami newbies are at a loss.  I would bet the majority of stranded
newbies would be in the Microsoft user category.

&gt;<i> 4.) After using the free Xitami, I would be willing to pay for more
</I>&gt;<i> features for an upgrade.  I just have no need for SSL.  I am just
</I>&gt;<i> interested in serving up cool pages, not commerce.  I would love to
</I>&gt;<i> see features that allow me to use Macromedia Dreamweaver, Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> Front Page, and Adobe Go Live with Xitami.  Obviously, if you cant set
</I>&gt;<i> up FTP then you cant use either Macromedia or Adobe products for
</I>&gt;<i> administration.....or at least it becomes very hard to do to the point
</I>&gt;<i> that their benefits are nullified. Considering that the option of
</I>&gt;<i> Front Page has already been taken away, then eliminating the other two
</I>&gt;<i> options is a bigt drawback for Xitami.
</I>
Oy!  That is the beauty of Xitami!!!!!  If you have not realized that and you 
are still asking for your hand to be held, that is the market to which 
Microsoft caters!  Look at the cost effectiveness of using Xitami, regardless 
of whether you are a business owner, head of your IT department or the 
average Joe Blow looking to impress family and friends.  It doesn't matter 
from where you come in this world:  everything comes with a cost.  Xitami 
is free!  Xitami allows filters to be added (i.e., PHP, SSI, etc.).  Many of the 
filters that have become web de rigeur are also free.  Activestate's Perl is 
free.  And, most programming knowledge online is free.  Still, you have not 
incurred any costs.  Unless you are tempted by Microsoft's &quot;forbidden fruit&quot; 
(AKA proprietary applications), you will not generally incur a cost.  Further, 
I shall continue this in the next paragraph (see below)

&gt;<i> 5.) An application server that is integral to Xitami is indispensible.
</I>&gt;<i>  I dont understand the logic of offering SSL for secure shopping
</I>&gt;<i> carts, but not the engines/servers that make the shopping cart work. 
</I>&gt;<i> ASP and JSP servers are necessary.
</I>
Yes, you shall incur costs for activating ASP or JSP... perhaps.  Where 
there is a will, there is a way (I had to add one more cliche; otherwise, I 
would not feel complete today).  Larry Wall, Perl &quot;Philosopher&quot;, created one 
of the most impactful acronyms I have ever heard (and, trust me:  since our 
company works in tandem with several governmental systems and myriad 
human service organizations, I have heard my fair share of acronyms!!!!).  
His is:  TIMTOWTDI (There is more than one way to do it).  Actually, I have 
made it a personal mantra.  If you believe that you can only build the 
functionality of a shopping cart by using ASP or JSP, I suggest you begin 
your &quot;Summer reading&quot; on these web sources:

1.  Activestate (www.activestate.com)
2.  Selena Sol's Extropia (www.extropia.com)
3.  O'Reilly's Perl (www.perl.com)
4.  Imatix, parent of Xitami (www.imatix.com)

&gt;<i> Last but not least: Offer your clients to buy only the options they
</I>&gt;<i> need. This is why people dont like Microsoft IIS.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> overcomplicated and full of stuff that you dont need BUT WERE FORCED
</I>&gt;<i> TO PAY FOR.  If you can offer a base package with incremental add-ons
</I>&gt;<i> (each with a price) I think you would really please your following.  I
</I>&gt;<i> am certainly willing to pay for more features beyond that of the free
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami.
</I>
Poor form!!!  Firstly, that is the entire philosophy of Xitami.  Actually, if we 
were in a US Court, I could say &quot;I rest my case.&quot;  In closing, 'La gente 
educada sabe cuando escuchar'.
