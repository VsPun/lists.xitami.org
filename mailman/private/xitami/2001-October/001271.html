It may be disabled by default. Here is a fairly simple set of stuff to 
do (this assumes you have a clean Xitami config - ie. no changes to 
anything after the initial installation). It is possible that some or 
all of these steps will be performed during the installation so this is 
partly a check to make sure it is working right.

step 1.
Create (or edit ) a file called defaults.cfg in the xitami directory 
(usually c:\xitami\ for windows) and add a section as below:

[Security]
    Filename = &quot;defaults.aut&quot;

Save this file

step 2.
Create (or edit ) a file called defaults.aut in the xitami directory 
(usually c:\xitami\ for windows) and add a section as below:

[/admin]
    SecureName = &quot;SecurePassword&quot;

(obviously pick a different name/password combination to the above 
unless you want us to hack in!)
Save this file

step 3.
Check that Xitami is running (you have a green X icon in the system 
tray). It may already be running, if so thats fine if not run Xitami. If 
you don't get a green little icon then theres a problem right there. 
Possible errors (resulting in a red icon) are that you accidentally have 
another web server running

step 4
Start up your web browser and point it to <A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</A> or 
<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1">http://127.0.0.1</A>
You should get a Welcome to Xitami  screen

Somehwere on the left hand side you will see some text that say
'To configure the server, use the web-based admin 
&lt;<A HREF="http://localhost/admin">http://localhost/admin</A>&gt; function. This is password-protected.'
click on the link and enter the secureUser and securePassword you put in 
defualts.aut above
you should now be in the first admin screen- Click configuration to 
start configuring things

If you get to the first screen but all clicks just return you to it the 
most likely thing is that you are running a Netscape 6.x / Mozilla 
browser which objects to some Javascript that Xitami uses. Use a 
different browser would be my suggestion.
