The problem is actually with any recursive use of SSI -- there's an
&quot;off-by-one&quot; issue which means that Xitami was storing an
end-of-document marker before the next bit of included SSI, and hence
running into problems.

This is fixed in our version in CVS
(see <A HREF="http://cvs.imatix.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs/">http://cvs.imatix.com/cgi-bin/viewcvs/</A>)
but not in any of the binaries that have been built.

&gt;<i>Also in the process of debugging and playing I noticed that Xitami has a 
</I>&gt;<i>limit on files with SSI includes of about 35,000+ bytes (one file 
</I>&gt;<i>displayed upto the 35922nd byte, another upto the 35553rd) and any data 
</I>&gt;<i>thereafter is abruptly truncated. 
</I>
I think this has also been reported, and I think it may have been fixed
in the version in CVS.

Thanks for the reports.
