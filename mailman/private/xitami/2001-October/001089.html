<PRE>I'm puzzled by whats happening to my copy of Xitami. It seems to run 
fine for a few hours, then whilst I'm asleep it suspends itself. When I 
wake up in the morning, click ok on the 'Xitami Suspended' box, it 
crashes.

Sometimes it manages to last for a couple of days, but then the last few 
days its fallen over each night. I am getting quite a lot of NIMDA and 
Code Red attacks on my PC, but they don't seem to happen at the time 
Xitami suspends itself.

Would an error message appear in one of the logs? If so which one?

I did manage to (no idea how) install version 2.5b5 - I unstalled it, 
and reinstalled 2.4d9, but some parts (it seems the icon on the Control 
Panel has stayed) remain. Is there a sure-fire way I can get rid of all 
Xitami, then reinstall it ?

Its probably not related, but it would be nice to know how to remove it 
completely and start again.

Any thoughts on the crashing ??

Ben.
