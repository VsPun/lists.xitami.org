<PRE>I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to achieve here. I'll assume you 
want to run Xitami on a reasonably workstation-type computer rather than a 
dedicated server.

First, try using Xitami with a web browser running on the same computer as 
Xitami itself, while claiming your IP address is &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;. This is a 
reserved IP - *any* computer told to connect to 127.0.0.1 will connect to 
itself. <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/admin">http://127.0.0.1/admin</A> should get you into the admin screen without 
even being connected to the Internet (note: you may need to turn off 
auto-dialling if you're using Internet Explorer and a dialup modem; my 
apologies if this sounds stupid, but I'm in the UK so I have no idea 
whether Earthlink is a dialup provider or cable or DSL or what).

Once it works with 127.0.0.1, try your dynamic IP (as reported by 
winipcfg). Unfortunately, your hostname will change with your IP (on many 
dynamic IP systems your hostname is something like 
modem-143.server-3.dialup.obscure.net) so giving your address to your 
friends could be tricky unless you use a dynamic DNS system (the Xitami 
docs include links to dyndns.org and others).

As for your domain, I can't tell how it's set up - is sound-computing.com a 
spare server box you own, or hosted on someone else's web server, or your 
workstation, or what? If that's not the machine you're trying to run Xitami 
on (which I assume it isn't since it's already running some other web 
server), it's irrelevant. For example, I have a domain which points to a 
commercial web host's Linux box (running Apache and various other servers), 
but that's completely irrelevant when I'm setting up Xitami on my own 
computer (whose domain is usually something horrible like 
modem-143.server-3.dialup.obscure.net).
