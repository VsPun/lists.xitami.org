<PRE>Brad,

Thank you for the explanation.

As a customer I think you would appreciate hearing what I would think worth
paying for:

1.) A better FTP is definetly one of them, as opposed to SSL capabilities.
I think most of the people that are running a small server are not
necessarily using it for commerce.....they just want an easy and simple way
to get their web pages up.  That said, most people who do this on their
spare time would certainly appreciate any remote administration or time
saving features.

2.) I would guess that the majority of people who want your server, dont
necessarily want it just because it is free.  I know that I would love to
see an easy to use, but feature rich server for under $300.oo.  It is still
a lot of money, but it is better than the several thousand dollars of IIS
and other servers.

3.) I would also guess that the majority of the people who want an easy to
install/use server are NOT IT PROFFESSIONALS.  My guess is that many of them
do not know how to program, and just want the easy to use Web Admin screens,
and not the config files for configuration.

4.) After using the free Xitami, I would be willing to pay for more features
for an upgrade.  I just have no need for SSL.  I am just interested in
serving up cool pages, not commerce.  I would love to see features that
allow me to use Macromedia Dreamweaver, Microsoft Front Page, and Adobe Go
Live with Xitami.  Obviously, if you cant set up FTP then you cant use
either Macromedia or Adobe products for administration.....or at least it
becomes very hard to do to the point that their benefits are nullified.
Considering that the option of Front Page has already been taken away, then
eliminating the other two options is a bigt drawback for Xitami.

5.) An application server that is integral to Xitami is indispensible.  I
dont understand the logic of offering SSL for secure shopping carts, but not
the engines/servers that make the shopping cart work.  ASP and JSP servers
are necessary.

Last but not least: Offer your clients to buy only the options they need.
This is why people dont like Microsoft IIS.  It is overcomplicated and full
of stuff that you dont need BUT WERE FORCED TO PAY FOR.  If you can offer a
base package with incremental add-ons (each with a price) I think you would
really please your following.  I am certainly willing to pay for more
features beyond that of the free Xitami.

Subject: Re: [Xitami] xitami ftp server problem


This is a topic that comes up over and over again, so I will explain
why it happens and what our company did to &quot;fix&quot; it.  The best part
is that I will keep the explanation and solution in layman terms.

Xitami's ftp server works fine, actually very well... as long as you
are not behind a firewall.  File Transfer Protocol is an older transfer
protocol that, normally, doesn't work well behind a firewall.

Here, we struggled with this back and forth, finally concluding that
there was no way we could operate without a firewall.  Our first
compromise was merely to disable the ftp portion of Xitami.  After
all, from our perspectives, the first time we tried Xitami was based
on the curiosity of a full-featured web server with a small footprint.
We had always seen the ftp server as a bonus.

Since that time, we realized that ftp definitely had it's place,
especially with remote administration.  Our solution was to install a
separate ftp server that had the capabilities to handle PASV
transfers from behind a firewall.  In our case, we didnt have much
time to investigate all the options, so we went on recommendation
and have great fondness for ServU FTP Server.  I don't want to write
anything that sounds biased, so I would appreciate if others who
have chosen alternative ftp options to express what ftp servers they
have that also work from behind a firewall.  And, if there are any
situations where people have managed to get Xitami's FTP server
to work, I am sure everyone at Imatix would appreciate hearing that
as well, at least for the sake of adding the information to the FAQ.

Personally, I appreciate the power of Xitami.  I know everyone
wants to have more integrated features added to Xitami.  But, from
my perspective, what most of the Xitami audience are running are
the freely available Xitami server.  Therefore, one cannot expect
Imatix to invest more time (which equates to money) into
developing more add-ons. When one looks at break-even rationale,
since we have a retail application for which we paid, an application
which advertises ftp, not stipulative ftp, I would have to say that I
would prefer that Imatix spend my money (therefore their time)
investing in better development of a currently advertised feature and
having it work to it's fullest potential.

I am getting a nosebleed.... time to get off the soapbox. ;)
