Please find whatever mailer setting is doing this and STOP it; we don't
need to see everything you write (and worse, everything everyone before
you has written, and that you're quoting, without trimming) in duplicate,
once as plain ASCII text, and once as HTML.  The latter should only ever
be sent when the recipient has given permission for you to over-inflate
the length of your messages; NEVER dual-post to a mailing list like this!

&gt;<i> What about the &quot;InstantASP&quot; that Xitami touts as their ASP solution.  Other
</I>&gt;<i> than the bruising $1,000 price tag, does it work????
</I>
InstantASP is NOT Xitami's solution; if you follow the link, you'll
realize that it's written by a different company.  Moreover, there is a
free evaluation version, so try before you buy.

I did try this about 6 months ago, hoping to move away from IIS for a
course we teaching.  Sadly, at that time, InstantASP did not handle some
perfectly common ASP objects, and so was not viable.  They promised a
revision shortly; I haven't looked to see if it's been published as yet.

[140 lines of needless dual-posting and over-quoting snipped]

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
