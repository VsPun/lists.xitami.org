<PRE>I have a Perl script in webroot/cgi-bin, which reads a text file in and
outputs it in HTML format to the requesting browser (see smaple script
below). Well, that's what it's supposed to do.

It works at the DOS prompt, opening the file and printing output to the
screen. However, if I try the script through a browser, the server returns
no file contents. I assumed the problem was a permissions error, so as a
brute force resolution, I gave Everyone, Full Permissions to the cgi-bin
directory, which still doesn't work.

The Xitami server itself is running under the NT Administrator user, so
should definitely be included in the Everyone group and have full
permissions to all files on the local machine. The working dir. is set to
&quot;-&quot; as recommended, yet it manages to create temporary files in D:\Temp,
which contain the output sent to the screen. So why can't it read in the
files?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Script:

#!perl

# Define Variables
	$Script;
	$lines;

# Read Name of Script
	$Script = $ENV{'SCRIPT_NAME'};
	if ($Script eq &quot;&quot;) {$Script = &quot;default.txt&quot;};

# Open Script
	open(TXT, &quot;&lt;&quot;.$Script);
	@text=&lt;TXT&gt;;
	close(TXT);

# Print Script to screen
	&amp;Header;
	print &quot;\nScript to be processed: &lt;b&gt;&quot;.$Script.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;;
	foreach $line(@text){
		print &quot;$line.&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
		$lines++;
	}
	if($lines&lt;1){$lines=&quot;no&quot;};
	&amp;Footer;

sub Header{
	print &quot;content-type:text/html\n\n&lt;html&gt;&quot;;
	print &quot;&lt;title&gt;View File Script&lt;/title&gt;&quot;;
}

sub Footer{
	print &quot;There are &lt;b&gt;&quot;.$lines.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; lines&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
	print &quot;&lt;b&gt;The End&lt;/b&gt;&quot;;
	print &quot;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;;
}
#	End viewfile.pl
