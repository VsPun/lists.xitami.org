<PRE>I'm not exactly sure that I understand what you're saying, but I got PHP4 to work with Xitami. I got the windows binary from php.net
and MySQL from mysql.com.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami2.4d9 and PHP4


I tested Xitami for about a year and a half, then finally gave up on it and
went back to Apache.  I'm back testing it again, trying to run a php4 driven
MySQL database application to see if it will reduce CPU/memory load over
what Apache uses.  The server is running on a twin Pentium-Pro, powered by
Debian Linux/2.2.19 kernel, and 512MB RAM.  Apache version is 1.3.24 with
PHP4.4.1 as loadable module for Apache, and using the php4-mysql module to
drive the database.  All applications installed with Debian debs from the
woody distro.

Question:
Can Xitami be used with the PHP module for Apache, or do I have to compile a
seperate PHP app on the server?  If I need the seperate PHP app, I'll
compile it and drop it in.

Question:
It's been awhile, but if I remember correctly, to enable parsing of PHP you
have to add a line for a filter like: .php=/path/to/php4/executable ???

Other observations:
* Xitami *still* doesn't write a PID file on UNIX platforms.  This was one
of my pet peeves with the previous versions as well - it'd be nice to be
able to run Xitami from init.d or tcpserver on UNIX hosts instead of having
to use killall to stop the process and a script to start it when
configurations are changed or virtual domains added or removed.

* The FTP server still won't handle hardly any load at all - I've found I
can't use it for serious FTP work.

* The webbased admin panel still positively rocks - much easier than editing
Apache's config file via ssh, and then reloading the server with
/etc/init.d/apache reload.  But I can't get Xitami's server restart function
to work every time when throwing in a new domain or making other config
changes that require reload of the /usr/local/bin/xitami/defaults.cfg file.
I've found I still have to ssh to the box, kill xitami, then execute the
start script to fire it back up and force the config file reload.  Others
have this problem?
