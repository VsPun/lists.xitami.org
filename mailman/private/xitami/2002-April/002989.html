<PRE>The most sophisticated type of attack is a Smurf DoS.  To Smurf is to change
the source IP address of every out going packet and then hit someones server
with hundreds or thousands of packets per second.    When someone is
Smurfing you, its nearly impossible to track them down because every packet
has a false source address, and each false address is different from the
previous one.  The most common form of a Smurf DoS is a &quot;Syn&quot; attack.

A &quot;syn&quot; is a tcp packet one computer sends to another to initiate a
communication of some sort, the recipient computer gets the &quot;syn&quot;, checks
the source address of that syn and then responds with an &quot;ack&quot; (ack =
acknowledgement), completing the handshake and then both computers start
talking and listening to each other.  However, years ago, most computers
only had a buffer to handle up to, maybe, 200 &quot;syn&quot;s per second.  So,
hackers would Smurf hundreds of &quot;syn&quot;s to a server.  The server would get so
busy handling false &quot;syn&quot;s that it would never really have enough time to
handle real requests - thus, effectively shutting down the server or more
importantly, it gets denied the ability to communicate its services.

In recent years, patches and software developers increased the buffer size
that handled the syns into the thousands, and then they started creating
individual buffers for specific sockets on servers.  Typical services that
always needed to be running were ports: 23, 25, 69, 80, 110 (probably a few
others) - those ports received their own buffers that could handle thousands
per second while all other ports shared the one main buffer.

And to be honest, I don't know what has been done over the last year or two
to combat SYN attacks.  I do know though, years ago, the Principal Engineer
for MCI wrote a program that used the OSPF Spanning tree algorithm to
back-track smurf attacks.  But it only worked on an ATM backbone because ATM
has the ability, at Layer 2, to check sourcing of incoming packets via PVCs.
The program would start at the Victims router and then login into every
router that connected directly to that one router.  The program would find
the next router traffic was coming through, then login to that router and
perform the same process until eventually, the program reached the source
router.  The source router could be a edge router talking to another
backbone (like Sprint, UUNET, BBN Planet, ANS, etc) or the source router
could be a router that connected to a smaller downstream Tier 2 provider
(regional ISPs) OR the router could be a directly connected customer.  The
only power MCI had was over its directly connected customers and then they
would shut down that customers link until that customer found who the
internal user was that was responsible for the attack.

Anyway, as you read in earlier responses to this thread, there are all new
kinds of DoS attacks these days.  The key to avoid being attacked is: don't
piss anyone off, don't be a mega company with mega dollars, never claim your
site is hack-proof free, don't try to impress the world, don't release
shitty software - oh yeah, and don't have any computers on the internet.
