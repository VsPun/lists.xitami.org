<PRE>I previously e-mailed this list about a problem with 50 simultaneous
connections to CGI scripts under Xitami.  I have since performed additional
testing and have come to the conclusion that CGIs are a fatal source of
DoS/DDoS attacks with the Xitami webserver under Windows (others have
complained about Xitami slowing to a crawl under Linux).  Below are the
steps that I took to come to this conclusion:

1)  I fixed my localhost Distributed Attack Server/Client (DAS/DAC) so that
it didn't crash (really silly problem dealing with attempting to allocate
and write to the same area of memory at the same time).

2)  I fixed many of XiFusion's bugs that people have mentioned since the
release of v2.5.

3)  I re-ran the DAS/DAC.  The same problems arose as before in the logs.
Just a refresher, the log files look like this under a 60 user load:
127.0.0.1 - - [28/Apr/2002:15:20:49 -0500] &quot;GET /distattack/dist1.cfm

Obviously, a very serious problem is occurring here.  Sometimes I am
getting zero bytes returned, one byte returned, and the rest of the time
the correct number of bytes returned.

At this point, I whipped out my compiler, Borland's C RTL, and downloaded
the latest stable Xitami source.

4)  Next, I wrote my own function that calls CreateProcess and
WaitForSingleObject to see if either function fails within XiFusion.  The
same problems arose and neither function failed.

5)  I created a file for every single thread started in the DAC to track
exactly what happens with each thread.  The DAC stopped opening files after
47 files were opened.  The problem:  The number of open files had been
exceeded for the application.

Obviously, I only hit a C library limitation, but it dawned on me that
since CreateProcess was not failing and WaitForSingleObject was not
failing, creating the file handle is the only alternative.  Below is a
logical explanation of what is happening inside both Xitami and XiFusion:

1)  A request comes to the Xitami webserver for a CGI-based application
(assume for this example XiFusion is associated with the file extension).
2)  Xitami calls the function process_create() to launch the CGI.
3)  Inside process_create(), the function redirect_io() is called three
times (once for each standard handle).  This creates three file I/O handles
which the CGI is supposed to dump its data into.  However, there is no test
for whether or not the file was opened successfully within redirect_io()
for both std_out and std_err.  If either fails to open,
INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is returned (which is -1) and the resulting value is
assigned to the STARTUPINFO structure that is submitted to CreateProcess().
4)  XiFusion is then launched via CreateProcess and then the process is
waited on (CreateProcess rarely ever fails (only under low system resources
will it fail) and I have yet to see WaitForSingleObject to fail as well - I
also have set my CGIs to run until they finish).  Note, at this point in
the Xitami code, it fails to detect whether WaitForSingleObject() fails or
not.
5)  XiFusion's underlying Borland C RTL fails to detect whether
GetStdHandle fails.  The value at this point should be INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
if Xitami failed to create the file handle.  All output data will therefore
fail to be displayed, hence zero bytes returned.
6)  XiFusion itself fails to check to see if its own stdout redirection
fails.  Hence the return of only one byte of data (padding) in some cases
where stdout was successfully created by Xitami.
7)  Only very rarely, will both redirected input and output handles get
created in Xitami and the redirected output handle in XiFusion (Xitami has
a better chance of creating the redirected input handle since it will
Sleep(1000) if it fails to be created).  This explains the occasional
correct number of bytes returned from the server.


MSDN Library demonstrates the correct way to start processes with
redirected input and output:

MSDN Library-&gt;Platform SDK-&gt;Base Services-&gt;DLLs, Processes, and
Threads-&gt;Processes and Threads-&gt;Using Processes and Threads-&gt;Creating a
Child Process with Redirected Input and Output

Unfortunately, most compiler writers use the poor example mentioned in the
CreateProcess() description.

Under normal circumstances this issue will not occur, but under very heavy
CGI usage, the problems will appear frequently (95-99% of the time).
End-users will be unable to get results and their browsers will, in many
cases, appear to hang on a completed webpage (zero bytes returned).
Several people have mentioned that I should make XiFusion a LRWP
application.  Doing this is possible, but a DoS/DDoS can still take place
just as easily (600 simultaneous users instead of 60).  It really does not
matter...the problem is that both Xitami and XiFusion have a major DoS/DDoS
issue that is going to take a while to fix.

Ewen, I have a 'localhost' version of the DAS/DAC ready if you want it for
testing purposes.  I don't want to distribute it to others because of the
implications this particular DoS has.

Hope this helps!
