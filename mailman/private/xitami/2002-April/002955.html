<PRE>I'd recommend a good firewall like Zona Alarm (free) or Norton 
Personal firewall.  You can stealth all ports except those you use and if 
any application wants to use the network you must give it permission 
first by creating a &quot;rule&quot; to let it run in the future.  It's not perfect security 
but better than nothing.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; These aren't malicious attempts are they?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They are, and they come from within your ISP, but probably not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;from&quot; your ISP. The IP number translates to a hostname that looks a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot like the one you sent this email from.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; host 24.128.72.232
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 232.72.128.24.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer
</I>&gt;<i> h00c0f03820eb.ne.client2.attbi.com
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; host 24.128.19.74
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  74.19.128.24.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer
</I>&gt;<i> h00a0cc58ab25.ne.client2.attbi.com
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What are they doing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &quot;GET /scripts/..%c1%9c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+dir
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This requested URL is &quot;malformed&quot;. The dots and percents aren't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right. Xitami properly notices that, and replies 404 or 403
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; depending on just where it decides that this is meaningless.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, MS IIS webserver is tricked into navigating up out of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; webpages folder, into the root, down into the windows system folder,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and runs CMD, the command processor! (Some call it the &quot;DOS box&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This involves two very stupid mistakes by MS IIS's programmers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Malformed URLs should be rejected, and files outside those folder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifically designated for web-serving should never be served. You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could say that running a program not designated for CGI delivery is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also a mistake, though MS IIS's notion of CGI is pretty elaborate,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supporting MS-proprietary extensions that basically sell MS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programming languages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this case, they request a DIR from CMD. On Xitami and patched
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IIS, the response is &quot;error&quot;, they ignore it. If the response is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list of files, they struck gold. They can put more clever commands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into CMD and do almost anything to your machine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You may wonder why they are trying IIS hacks on your Xitami server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, IIS is the second most common webserver, and THE most common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inside home-ISP networks. Many folks have IIS running and don't even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know it. And it is just plain easier to try a IIS-hack on every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine than to actually check which ones are IIS. Typically, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; script contacts -every- IP number in a given range, whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is a webserver there. If no server, it times-out. If a &quot;good&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; webserver, it ignores these silly requests. But unpatched IIS will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do the wrong thing quickly and efficiently.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This isn't a DoS attack. CMD..DIR just asks for a list of files. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they can do that, they can ask CMD to install software that could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start flooding other machines to jam them. But that's not seen here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You could report that IP number to your ISP. It is barely possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that your ISP is doing it: my net-admins do a similar (but better!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scan every month and inform anybody hosting a vulnerable machine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; More likely it is some kid reading hacker-sites and trying the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basic hack-scripts. If the ISP cares, they will warn the account
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; holder and the kid may be sent to bed without supper. But there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; always another kid.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It does you no harm, except a slight increase in log-file size. When
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CodeRed was popular, my logs were 10% real hits and 90% CodeRed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; errors. In the peak-week, it actually was a mild problem: my slow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine was bogged on logs, and I had to take it down for 10 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and delete some monster files. CodeRed and Samba are different: they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use a VERY long request URL (thousands of characters) to overflow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IIS's request buffer and inject malicious code into IIS. Again,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Xitami handles this correctly: no overflow, just an error and huge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; log files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  Perl.exe mysteriously disappeared from my machine recently.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Odd. But not something a hacker would want to do.
