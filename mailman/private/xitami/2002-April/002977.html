Let this *Click* represent the lightbulb of understanding over my 
head.  

You are correct.  It certainly looks like Xitami stores the entire text 
into a single limited variable (tsk tsk).  Whoever assigned that 
variable certainly wanted to keep a very small footprint.

I misunderstood because I've been generating pages of text from 
scripts using the ssi EXEC command and not the INCLUDE 
command.  This method allows huge megabytes of sculpted text 
which can be nested in dynamic files.  I don't think there's a limit to 
the number of EXEC calls you can make in a single document.

I wonder if any server that would allow you to *include* very large 
(mb) text files would also a security risk when they slow or crash 
doing memory manipulation.  Does IIS allow larger includes?

My guess is that Xitami also prefers outside scripts and software to 
take the memory and security risks so that the server doesn't crash 
~ like the scripts many people write.
