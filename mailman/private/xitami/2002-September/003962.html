I use Sygate Personal Firewall with Xitami and I've had no trouble with 
it.  It's quite easy to configure and is also free.  The latest version 
(version 5) can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://soho.sygate.com/default.htm.">http://soho.sygate.com/default.htm.</A>  If 
in doubt, you can also download a user's guide and/or a quick start guide 
from the support section of the site before committing yourself.  Even if 
you stay with Zone Alarm, reading these guides will give you a much better 
idea of exactly what firewalls are supposed to do and how they do it and 
that might help you resolve the problems you're having with Zone Alarm.

have fun :-)

&gt;<i>I've been running the free version of zone alarm on my system for a year 
</I>&gt;<i>now, with no problems at all.  I guess I eventually just got all the 
</I>&gt;<i>settings the way they needed to be, because I really don't know allot 
</I>&gt;<i>about it.. Anyway, I recently upgraded to the newer (still free) version, 
</I>&gt;<i>and I sure wish I hadn't!!  I can't get it set right, I don't know enough 
</I>&gt;<i>about it, and it's driving me crazy..  When I set it at any decent level 
</I>&gt;<i>of security, people can't get into my web site..  Of course if any of you 
</I>&gt;<i>can offer an easy way to set Zone Alarm I would sure appreciate it, but my 
</I>&gt;<i>real question is this.  Is there an easy way of setting up a good security 
</I>&gt;<i>for my web site (using xitami), to help prevent hacks, etc.. but will NOT 
</I>&gt;<i>interfere with traffic?? I am really a dummy with this!  At one time, I 
</I>&gt;<i>thought I saw a small program that acted kind of like a fire-wall, but 
</I>&gt;<i>just logged attempts, etc.. Any help with this is greatly appreciated, and 
</I>&gt;<i>I apologize for the long post!  Have a good day all!
