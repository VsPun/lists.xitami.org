<PRE>  Hello friends,

  I've been running the free version of zone alarm on my system for a year 
now, with no problems at all.  I guess I eventually just got all the 
settings the way they needed to be, because I really don't know allot about 
it.. Anyway, I recently upgraded to the newer (still free) version, and I 
sure wish I hadn't!!  I can't get it set right, I don't know enough about 
it, and it's driving me crazy..  When I set it at any decent level of 
security, people can't get into my web site..  Of course if any of you can 
offer an easy way to set Zone Alarm I would sure appreciate it, but my real 
question is this.  Is there an easy way of setting up a good security for my 
web site (using xitami), to help prevent hacks, etc.. but will NOT interfere 
with traffic?? I am really a dummy with this!  At one time, I thought I saw 
a small program that acted kind of like a fire-wall, but just logged 
attempts, etc.. Any help with this is greatly appreciated, and I apologize 
for the long post!  Have a good day all!

  John
