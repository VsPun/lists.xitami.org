<PRE>Just wondering where the status of 2.5 was - seems that neither it nor
2.4 have been updated in quite a while.  The main concerns from my users
would probably be remedied by http 1.1 compatibility which would allow
them to resume files, etc.  The bandwidth limiting that was implemented
in 2.5 would also be very handy for some of my virtual hosts.

The last time I tried the 2.5 beta though, virtual hosts were rather
broken (my 2.4 virtual host config didn't work in 2.5).  Any word on if
development on 2.5 is continuing?  I've been with Xitami for about 3
years now, and I really don't want to have to install a new server when
this one is so small and elegant.

Dave.
