<PRE>Hello !

The documentation says
&gt;<i> note that
</I>&gt;<i>      xitami automatically looks for .html extensions if a .htm file is not found. 
</I>
With Xitami 2.4.x, especially this works perfectly:

The file
anything.htm
can be addressed as
<A HREF="http://path/anything.htm">http://path/anything.htm</A>
and
<A HREF="http://path/anything.html">http://path/anything.html</A>

This was and is a great feature for me, as I still maintain my local
website with files with filenames in the 8+3 scheme,
as if I keep it I may edit the files within a DOS box with a plain MSDOS
editor !
and if I upload by WS_FTP, there is an automatic translation from .htm
to .html !

***** Now with Xitami 2.5.x, this never worked. ***** 
This is true for the current 2.5b5 too.

The  file
anything.htm
, if addressed as
<A HREF="http://path/anything.html">http://path/anything.html</A>
is displayed as plain text file, i.e. you see the HTML layout commands.

Even though I gave feedback to the developers 
<A HREF="mailto:xitami@imatix.com">xitami@imatix.com</A> 
at 22 Jan 2001, maybe this was TOO late as the development process still
had stopped.

So as Xitami is now on with a fresh new mailing list, I have another
try.

As long as this bug is not fixed, I'll be using 2.4.x, as this is a
major bug which prevents me from keeping my 8+3 naming scheme and
maintaining the files with a plain MSDOS editor.

Btw, may anybody tell me how to configure any other free WEB server
(Apache,..) to support that special translation feature ?

Sincerely
Rolf
