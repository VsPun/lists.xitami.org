<PRE>&gt;<i>  I find a bit strange about the Xitami install is that no cgi-bin
</I>&gt;<i> directory is created by the install. I have to make one myself. Is
</I>&gt;<i> this normal?
</I>
Yes.

Find a very old copy of Xitami, it creates a cgi-bin and drops a
sample file that prints the environment.

That sample script could be considered a security risk, so they took
it out of the system. The next time they built the archive, their
clever tool noticed that the cgi-bin directory was empty, and didn't
include it in the distribution.

I've looked at the rest of the thread and do not see why it isn't
working. Since non-Form scripts work, we know Perl is being found.
