I too have been wondering the same thing, so I decided to literally
follow the instructions on the developers page which state:

&quot;All the tools you need are an ANSI C compiler, and other free
software you can download from www.iMatix.com .&quot;

Well, I have an ANSI C compiler, several of them in fact, on both the
Windows and the BSD side of my machine. I went to the indicated site,
found the Downloads page and downloaded both copies of rbase. Guess
what? If you look in the boom sub-directory of either rbase archive
you will find the required &quot;c&quot; file. 8=)

No, it's not in any FAQ I could find either. As to why it is this way,
I don't know, perhaps an intelligence test for developers or perhaps a
way of separating the wanna-be's from the developers? To get the real
answer you'll have to ask the developers at Imatix. My personal
opinion is that the developers don't want you to compile just xitami
but want you to compile the entire rbase package in order to gain it's
advantages.

 Magus
