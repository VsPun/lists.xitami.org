MRJ InfoTech Admin guy: 

Sorry to post this to the foum, but I couldn't find your direct email (and I didn't want to go through your standard site contact page).  I checked out your site and saw all the various HTML and Flash templates and realized I may have some business opportunities for you (or those who designed the templates).  If you, or they, are interested please contact me offline so we may discuss this with more detail.

I am need of a template designer for as many as 20 templates that would change, or rotate, every 6 to 9 months.  The templates on the MRJ website all look very good and, more importantly, very simple - which is exactly the kind of thing I am looking for for my website.

Again, folks, sorry for spamming the group on this.

  OK. so I promised to release a little gadget that might help with the problem of 
  crashes being permanent and instead restore your Xitami process properly and
  instantly, almost. This depends on the settings you chose in the application.

  It is called xitamiKeepAlive (xiKA for short) and I uploaded it to my web site.

  You can download it now and try it, but please know, I have only been able to 
  test it briefly on Windows XP since I have no 98, 95 or 200 machines here.
  Also I don't use ME so I will not support that O/S

  The zip file contains three files, xitamiKeepAlive.exe, xiKA.exe and the PDF 
  file with help and hints, FAQ and a lot more. Also a read-me file is included 
  pointing out the section H on page 9 in the PDF file as a vital read.

  xitamiKeepAlive.exe is the GUI file to set it up and xiKA.exe is for the hidden sleeper processing.

  It uses approx. 3.2 Mb RAM and 0.0% CPU while waiting to act.

  The application will also allow you to specify regular reboot periods 
  for your server PC if you want to reset the machine completely.

  If you guys want to send me feedback or test results, and perhaps let 
  me know if it works on your machine, the instructions for this are 
  included as well in the PDF file.

  Please note! This application will only work on Windows and you must have
  Visual Basic Runtime 6 SP 3 or higher installed.

  And it is ONLY for Xitami 2.5c which has the xigui32.exe file.

  My URL is http://www.mrjdesign.net/ and click the XITAMI link in the top menu.

  If it doesn't work, it doesn't. But at least we will know, wont we :)

Not good... must be a glitch in the zip format.
I will upload a new zip to the site in the next five minutes.#

Unfortunately i do not speak French but I found a 
note from a web site stating the following.

"It is possible to make the remote web server 
execute arbitrary code by sending
  a lot of data on the remote TCP port 81. This 
problem may allow an attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on the remote system or create a denial of service.
  Solution : None at this time. Contact Xitami Risk factor : High"

It might also be of value to attempt to turn off 
the LWRP access in the section [LWRP]
and set enabled=0 to test if that will keep your server running better.
I am trying this as well now, and I don't use SSL 
so it shouldn't matter, right?

Hi all

I'm sending this both to the Xitami and ArgoSoft Mail Server user

tool that creates a new vhost and user in the Xitami web server, 
ArgoSoft Mail Server and FileZilla FTP server. Or will I have to try to 
do it myself.

The tools I have a hand are, "a thick book on xml", "a vbs script that 
can read/write *.ini style *.cgf files" and the " ActiveX library 
MlSvX.dll ". I have all the bits and pieces it's just putting them 
tougher. It would be nice if it where in a Xitami gsl script sense *.gsl 
is there variant of xml.

Thought I'd start a wish list, maybe someone has thought about it and maybe
some have implemented it. The first item on my Xitami Wish List is this.

I would like all my .aut's in one file and all my .cfg's in one file and
xitami just call the section that it needs. I have 12 sites but I have 32
.cfg's and 32 .aut's and I'm getting ready to add over 100 subdomains which
will increase my file count by 200+. Then if I might do that for 2 other
site which will increase it again by 400+. That's a lot of small little
files to keep track of. 

Ideas, suggestions? 

Move to Apache????

Very simple.

You add 101 files, not 2000.

Disable online administration and disallow the 
web admin interface for your VHosts, as it would 
render Xitami wide open to security leaks having web admin enabled.

As such, you point all AUT files for your VHosts 
to one single disabled admin file.

Voila, 99 files out of 100 removed.

As for the other 100 files, I find it extremely 
useful to have them in separate files, thereby 
simplifying the management of documents.

Besides, it is a very simple dead to write a CGI 
for your self, to run off of the root on the server,
to effectively write your own admin panel, which 
only you have access to and is hidden from
the publicly known view, by the documentation files of xitami.

As such you can in fact turn off the web admin 
completely, disable the LRWP from port 81, unless 
you use it for some ssl functions.
You should already have disabled the ftp, which 
is controlled from the default.cfg anyway, in a INI file style.

All of which is really simple to manage.

That's the way I do it at least.
Pretty simple and 99% of my work is done by remote control anyway.
In fact I have not had a monitor on any one of my 
servers for the past three years.
Except once, when installing a new machine 4 months ago.

I recommend avoiding GSL. It's OK for occasional use but is buggy and
results in crashes for no good reason now and then. I spent a long
tiem writing stuff in GSL that I subsequently rewrote in standrad
perl/CGI becuase the GSL couldn't cope with large XML files and
multiple hits on the same GSL file (at least I think that was the
other bug - I forget it's 3-4 years ago now)

(you can disable the XML processing via CSL by commenting out the line
  .xml=xixxml
in the [WSX] section of xitami.cfg)

I don't use the admin panel, and it was 200 not 2000 but still. I used the
web admin about a week before I decided it was useless. Still talking a lot.

 
The aut setup might work I don't think I need the aut files anyway.I never
thought about setting it in Xitami.cfg. As for the cfg still I'm talking
about 100+ per site then on my 2 national sites it could be 1 file per state
then 1 file per county. Even if it was one .cfg per site that would suffice
for me if I could put all the subdomains in it.
 
I don't know CGI either. Used to know some but don't know much now. I have
thought about writing something in PHP but I find I don't have that kind of
time anymore.

Okay I have somewhat of a solution, still requires a bunch of cfg files (for
now) but at least it's a bit more manageable. what I did was created a
directory just for the subdomain cfg's for a particular site. like this;
 
 
site.cfg
site (directory)
    subdomain.cfg
    subdomain2.cfg
site2.cfg
site2 (directory)
    subdomain.cfg
    subdomain2.cfg
 
I suppose I could even put the cfg for the main site in there too.

Very simple.

You add 101 files, not 2000.

Disable online administration and disallow the web admin interface for your
VHosts, as it would render Xitami wide open to security leaks having web
admin enabled.

As such, you point all AUT files for your VHosts to one single disabled
admin file.

Voila, 99 files out of 100 removed.

As for the other 100 files, I find it extremely useful to have them in
separate files, thereby simplifying the management of documents.

Besides, it is a very simple dead to write a CGI for your self, to run off
of the root on the server,
to effectively write your own admin panel, which only you have access to and
is hidden from 
the publicly known view, by the documentation files of xitami.

As such you can in fact turn off the web admin completely, disable the LRWP
from port 81, unless you use it for some ssl functions.
You should already have disabled the ftp, which is controlled from the
default.cfg anyway, in a INI file style.

All of which is really simple to manage.

That's the way I do it at least.
Pretty simple and 99% of my work is done by remote control anyway.
In fact I have not had a monitor on any one of my servers for the past three
years.
Except once, when installing a new machine 4 months ago.

will increase my file count by 200+. Then if I might do that for 2 other

Ideas, suggestions? 

Move to Apache????

Let me know how the domain generator works for you.
If you need DNS hosting we can do that for you.

The aut setup might work I don't think I need the aut files anyway.I never
thought about setting it in Xitami.cfg. As for the cfg still I'm talking
about 100+ per site then on my 2 national sites it could be 1 file per state
then 1 file per county. Even if it was one .cfg per site that would suffice
for me if I could put all the subdomains in it.
 
I don't know CGI either. Used to know some but don't know much now. I have
thought about writing something in PHP but I find I don't have that kind of
time anymore.

Very simple.

You add 101 files, not 2000.

Disable online administration and disallow the web admin interface for your
VHosts, as it would render Xitami wide open to security leaks having web
admin enabled.

As such, you point all AUT files for your VHosts to one single disabled
admin file.

Voila, 99 files out of 100 removed.

As for the other 100 files, I find it extremely useful to have them in
separate files, thereby simplifying the management of documents.

Besides, it is a very simple dead to write a CGI for your self, to run off
of the root on the server,
to effectively write your own admin panel, which only you have access to and
is hidden from 
the publicly known view, by the documentation files of xitami.

As such you can in fact turn off the web admin completely, disable the LRWP
from port 81, unless you use it for some ssl functions.
You should already have disabled the ftp, which is controlled from the
default.cfg anyway, in a INI file style.

All of which is really simple to manage.

That's the way I do it at least.
Pretty simple and 99% of my work is done by remote control anyway.
In fact I have not had a monitor on any one of my servers for the past three
years.
Except once, when installing a new machine 4 months ago.

Thought I'd start a wish list, maybe someone has thought about it and maybe
some have implemented it. The first item on my Xitami Wish List is this.

I would like all my .aut's in one file and all my .cfg's in one file and
xitami just call the section that it needs. I have 12 sites but I have 32
.cfg's and 32 .aut's and I'm getting ready to add over 100 subdomains which
will increase my file count by 200+. Then if I might do that for 2 other
site which will increase it again by 400+. That's a lot of small little
files to keep track of. 

Ideas, suggestions? 

Move to Apache????

Will be available soon enough.
However for this initial part I only activated the listing by US/CA region

I am short on time and tossed that together Sunday night, but there will 
soon be more available.
How do you like it otherwise? Is it useful? Something to build on?

You need to make a section like this in the aut file and test to see if
ok:

[/]
    Name=Password

There will be as many  Name=Password pairs as there are users, each pair
always on an individual line, and you are the one who is supposed to add
these to the file (by which ever method you see practical and safe).

Oh and you should take care to leave this entry in the file:

 [/Admin]
    name="your pass word"

separated before and after with new lines from the rest of the file,
in case your browser-based admin is enabled. Otherwise everyone who has
access to your [/] root directory will also have access to your /Admin
directory which happens to be under root.

I'll help you with any questions you have.

At what level do you want to make the compression work?

Typically, you can make almost all the changes in just two places. 
First, there is the HTTP protocol driver, smthttp.c and smthttp.l (the
state machine).  Second, there is the HTTP library module, smthttpl.c.

If you want to modify the state machine you need to understand Libero,
the tool we use.  It's well documented on imatix.com.

If you want to modify the library, you need to understand how it
works, and the best way is to read the code, and try to see how the
various functions are called from the protocol driver.  The library
code is *horrible*, I know this.  My apologies.

Subject: [Xitami] posting FORM to PHP script
Message-ID: <265dd3c30603281346vd16e7c9q829918d9879fe184@mail.gmail.com>

I cannot read the variables POSTed by a FORM to my PHP script.
Example:

File: form.htm
<form action="foo.php" method="post">
    Name:  <input type="text" name="username" /><br />
    Email: <input type="text" name="email" /><br />
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit me!" />
</form>

File: foo.php
<?php
   echo "USERNAME >"; echo $_POST['username']; echo "<";
   echo $_REQUEST['username'];

   import_request_variables('p', 'p_');
   echo $p_username;
?>

The foo script prints out:
USERNAME ><

I am running HP 5; and have set up the "Filter" section in Xitami to
point to php.exe; for PHP, I set 'register_globals = On' in the
php.ini file.

Have checked the various FAQs and online manuals.
Just what am I doing wrong?
thanks in advance
scott

The variables may be $_POST['username']
Which version of Xitami do you use?
