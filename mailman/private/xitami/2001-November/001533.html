Handing it off to the OS would be most helpful for the FTP part,
where user really do log in. Xitami also should impersonate the user
then, so the OS will check file accesses automatically.
This is not easy, though, firstly there may be several user logged
in but you can only impersonate one of them, and secondly this is
highly OS specific but Xitami ought to be portable. For this reason,
I don't recommend using the FTP part at all on FreeBSD, but instead
use the server that comes with the OS anyway.

If Xitami runs as a specific user, and only that user has read
permission on the file, then the clear-text things are no problem
IMHO. Just make sure Xitami as a web browser of FTP server or CGI
owner can't be tricked to deliver the file to clients. The problem
is, per default the file is world-readable and Xitami runs as root.

On FreeBSD I made Xitami to install unconfigured and it won't start
automatically. So I left the issue for the admin to clean up: invent
a xitami-user, write defaults.cfg and defaults.aut, provide file
permissions, and set up the autostart-at-boot thingy. It's perhaps
not fair, but technically nobody is in any danger by this install
routine. I've not made up my mind exactly how to change it, but will
somehow do a more complete automatic install; perhaps let it run as
user &quot;nobody&quot; and provide a very restrictive defaults.cfg (only HTTP
and no remote administration).
