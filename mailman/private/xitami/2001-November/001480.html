<PRE>I have problems that seem unresolvable with xitami, but for now, I'm OK (
[the obligatory] ).
I've done searchs online for a program that does what I've put below, but
none can do it.  I've asked people I know and people I don't know, who are
programmers, but no one can do it.  I am positive that there are no windows
programs that do what I have put below, and if anybody knows of any, let me
know.
Here are the program specs:
A simple windows program that counts the number of packets sent out from the
computer.  Also:
-It will save the number of packets to a file, which it saves when it is
closed and loads when it is launched.  This allows for a cumulative count
over many sessions and days and weeks and so on...
-A &quot;reset&quot; button, in order to reset the counter would be nice too.
-Make sure it has digit grouping...it should say &quot;1,592,509&quot; not &quot;1592509&quot;.

If you can help me, email <A HREF="mailto:cooladam@hotmail.com">cooladam@hotmail.com</A>
