<PRE>I have installed Xitami and the web server works well. However, I cannot get
FTP to work, which is most frustrating. I suspect my setup is a bit
unusual... can anyone help?

I have an ISDN connection and my machine is behind a router which does NAT.
Because I have a dynamic IP address, I use TZO.com. (I have registered my
domain name to TZO's name servers; software on my machine monitors my
changing IP address and passes this info to TZO, which redirects traffic
which hits its servers looking for me back to my machine.)

People hitting my FTP server typically just get the time-out message.
Occassionally, someone gets logged on anonymously, but then the system drops
them when they try to download something. A tech at TZO was able to upload a
file to my machine, but not download. On my side of the router, everything
seems to work perfectly (the machines that I have can use the FTP service -
although only by using the local machine numbers as addresses... they are
not able to use my internet domain name, something I understand is normal
for being behind a router.)

I noticed that there is a setting in Xitami for Dynamic DNS. I have not been
able to get this configured properly, and suspect this could be the
problem's cause, although I am not even sure of this.

Here is the details on the DDNS settings:

1. Enable DNS sign on? YES/NO (default is NO)
2. DDNS service definition file:  (default is &quot;ddnsdef.xml&quot;)
3. Dynamic DNS service:  Default is &quot;DDNS test using localhost&quot;.
4. Your server domain name: (no default).
5. Your username or e-mail adddress: (no default). I have given my email
address, which is the user name used by TZO.com.
6. Your password or DDNS key: (no default). I have supplied the TZO &quot;key&quot;
which TZO assigned to me.

I have tried setting No. 1 to YES, No. 2 to the default file of
&quot;ddnsdef.xml&quot;, No. 3. to &quot;TZO.com&quot;, No. 4 to &quot;elitz.com&quot; and also tried the
name of my local machine, No. 5 to
&quot;<A HREF="mailto:reds@chicagonet.net">reds@chicagonet.net</A>&quot; (my email address), and No. 6 to my assigned TZO key
for elitz.com.

The ddnsdef.xml file has a section relevant to when No. 3 is set to
&quot;TZO.com&quot;.  It reads as follows:

&lt;!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    tzo.com

    Service for tzo.com domains.  TZO uses an e-mail address as the
username,
    and a generated key as password.  Fast DNS updates.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
&lt;SERVICE
  NAME  = &quot;tzo.com&quot;
  TITLE = &quot;tzo.com&quot;
  HOST  = &quot;rh.tzo.com&quot;
  URL   = &quot;tzo.com&quot;
  PORT  = &quot;21333&quot; &gt;
  &lt;SIGNON
    URL  = &quot;/webclient/rhsignedon.html&quot;
    ARGS =
&quot;TZOName=$(domain)&amp;Email=$(username)&amp;TZOKey=$(password)&amp;CType=6&amp;B1=Sign+On+t
o+TZO+DDNS+Servers&quot;
    SEND = &quot;GET $(url)?$(args) HTTP/1.0\r\n$(httpheaders)&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;SIGNOFF
    URL  = &quot;/webclient/signedoff.html&quot;
    ARGS = &quot;B1=Sign+Me+Off+from+TZO&quot;
    SEND = &quot;GET $(url)?$(args) HTTP/1.0\r\n$(httpheaders)&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/SERVICE&gt;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The error message generated in the Xitami console message window is:

2001/11/04 14:53:21: xiddns: 'localhost': HTTP/1.1 404 Not found

The TZO tech has asked that I work with Xitami people, as he is not sure of
the problem. He seemed to feel that the problem was that Xitami is using IP
references that are exclusively for local use: 192.168.1.2 and 127.0.0.1. I
think he may be right (these IP numbers are in the &quot;statistics&quot; window that
appears when I click the Xitami icon) and that the solution is to get Xitami
to recognize my changing IP, hence my question about DDNS.

Thank you.
