<PRE>It sounds to me like your TZO client may be sending your router mapped IP, I
say this because if they are saying that they get that common network IP
address as the resolved address, it would have to be comming from TZO as
reported to them via client.  Perhaps a matter of the TZO client needing to
know what IP to be providing via the client.  (isp vs network).   I really
see no other way they would see your network IP externally.

You can test this theory by going to the control panel at TZO and placing
your current ISP address manually into the given entry field they provide
for doing this manually- (turn off the tzo client so it doesn't override it
again).

See if it then works- If you want to contact me via email directly it may
prove faster- I've run xitami, and about everything under the sun with my
TZO setup so I'm sure we could find the issue with a few wacks at it.

This doesn't take into account any mapping you may need to do for ports, but
I'm not sure that's even your issue here.

&gt;<i> Hi Jack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am using an OfficeConnect ISDN LAN Modem. I believe it functions like a
</I>&gt;<i> stand-alone router. Two computers plug into it, so it has an IP address,
</I>and
&gt;<i> each of the machines behind it also have one. It does NAT.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only feature I have not been able to implement with Xitami using the
</I>&gt;<i> TZO
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client is FTP. I was trying to get the integrated DDNS function in
</I>Xitami
&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work only because I thought it might resolve my FTP problem. Perhaps my
</I>&gt;<i> real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem with FTP is that I am also behind a router? Any help you could
</I>&gt;<i> give
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me with that issue, Stephen, -or anyone else-, would be greatly
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ROUTER ISSUE:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My machine, like Stephen's machine, is part of a netork, but only a
</I>small
&gt;<i> &gt; one consisting of my machine and another machine used to play
</I>occassional
&gt;<i> &gt; two-player games. All unsolicited internet traffic is routed to my main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine - as determined by a setting in the router software. Can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggest a reason why the Xitami web server works to serve web pages to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people outside my network, but won't work to serve FTP? The TZO tech
</I>&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people have been nice, but unable to help with this, suggesting that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem may be my Xitami settings. They say that their FTP client keeps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting 192.168.1.2 as my machine's IP address (my machine's local IP)
</I>&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they hit my site (when the TZO client is running), instead of the
</I>dynamic
&gt;<i> &gt; address assigned by my ISP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have read everything I can about my router, but have found no obvious
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; settings which would tell it to treat FTP traffic in a certain way. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; router is a 3Com router and is configured via a web page interface, so
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; emphasis of the router software is on keeping things simple. I was
</I>&gt;<i> concerned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the router wasn't designed to do what I'm doing in mind, but the
</I>good
&gt;<i> &gt; news is that I have found that I can telnet to my router's IP address,
</I>and
&gt;<i> &gt; that there are many &quot;unimplemented&quot; text commands that can change the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; router's settings, if necessary. I would obviously rather run just
</I>Xitami
&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible, rather than Xitami and the TZO client.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DDNS ISSUE:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The router may be the ultimate solution to my problem, but even so, it
</I>&gt;<i> does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not explain why the Xitami DDNS feature is not working with TZO, or
</I>&gt;<i> explain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the rather cryptic error messages I am getting from Xitami. I am still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; curious about that. I don't think this feature is well implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DNS SERVER:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks, Stephen, for the suggestion about <A HREF="http://www.jhsoft.com/.">http://www.jhsoft.com/.</A> I
</I>&gt;<i> reviewed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the pages there, but don't think this is an issue for me. As I
</I>understand
&gt;<i> &gt; it, a DNS server would be something I would be interested in if I had a
</I>&gt;<i> lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of machines on my side of the router, right? My current network setting
</I>in
&gt;<i> &gt; Windows ME is &quot;DNS disabled.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TESTING MY OWN WEB PAGE/FTP PAGE:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, someone told me that, because I was behind a router, I simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cannot visit my own machine through the internet. In other words,
</I>although
&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can hit <A HREF="http://192.168.1.2">http://192.168.1.2</A> or &quot;trick&quot; my machine into taking me to my
</I>own
&gt;<i> &gt; web page by mapping my domain to this IP through the &quot;hosts&quot; file, there
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no way for me to test my site as people on the other side of the router
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would see it. This has been very frustrating because Xitami works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beautifully on this side of the router. It's only when I get involved in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dynamic IP stuff that things don't work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been playing with this for more than 3 weeks now with almost no
</I>luck.
&gt;<i> &gt; It's been really frustrating, so I REALLY appreciate any help I get on
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The thing that has me most confused is that the Web pages serve, the FTP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; won't. What gives?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -Carl.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Carl my IP address is dynamic also.  I am also using TZO to resolve the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dynamic IP issue and have been successful in running Xitami behind a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; router.  I never bothered to setup the DDNS feature in Xitami since I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already running the TZO client on my server.  Since I am on a network
</I>and
&gt;<i> &gt; behind a router I am also using a DNS server which allows me to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access &quot;MYDomain.com&quot; from any pc on my network.  &quot;Simple DNS' located
</I>at
&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.jhsoft.com/">http://www.jhsoft.com/</A> offers a solution for this, remember also that if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're using a router you will have to map port 80 to the machine that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're running Xitami on.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I am using xitami v2.5b4 and have had no luck getting the DDNS feature
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; work. Is anyone using this that might be able to lend a hand? I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; TZO.com and have not been able to get the server to connect to TZO's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; machine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and retreive my dynamic IP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The configuration page in Xitami gives me the &quot;In progress... check
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; console
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; messages&quot; response whenever I try to sign on. In the message section,
</I>I
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the following log entries:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: sending DDNS sign-on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2001/11/10 19:31:02: xiddns: 'localhost': HTTP/1.1 404 Not found
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I also have noticed that I can't get the console to keep my settings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; return to the default settings whenever I leave the DDNS page, even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I hit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the &quot;save&quot; button.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thank you.
