<PRE>Hi -

I'm running Xitami 2.5b5 on a PII-450 system running Win2K-SP2.

Xitami will run for a while - a day or so - but eventually - it
crashes.  It says it's generating an error log, but I can't find it -
it's not in the normal Xitami log area.  As it typically happens when
I'm not home or around, I don't know exactly when it crashes - or if
it correlates to being asked to fetch some page - but the access and
error logs indicate nothing unusual (other than the occasional Code
Red II stuff).

I just upgraded to Win2K from WinNT4.0 - and this has started
happening since the upgrade.  Under 4.0, it was solid as a rock.
I know that the Xitami on-line help doesn't explicitly say that it
runs under Win2K... and maybe it doesn't.

Another thing - this happened under NT as well - but when I go to
re-start Xitami after it has either died on its own or because I've
stopped it for whatever reason - it never comes back up - I get a
flash of the green Xitami icon in the traybar, a message box that says 
the HTTP service was started on port 80, and then when the Xitami icon 
goes red.

Anyone have any ideas about either of these problems?

Thanks in advance...

Regards,
Kevin Autrey
