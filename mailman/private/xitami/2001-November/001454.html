<PRE>

Just a 'by the by'. Take a look at smartftp (download from www.smartftp.com)
I've tried CuteFTP,
LeechFTP and WS_FTP and have found none of them as satisfying to use as
smartftp. Also
smartftp is free unless you care to make a donation.

i dont know weather or not this is the same problem but i have been using
cuteftp1.8 for a few years now and it has worked quite hapily.

i saw no problem when i moved from nt to 2000.

however a few months back i statted seeing only some or none of the dirs on
a drive or in a folder.

after much checking of  settings etc i discovered that simply upgrading to a
newer version of cuteftp fixed the problem.

Other than that you may have chosen &quot;change to ntfs&quot; when you were
installing 2000 and find yourself with one drive having a fat partition and
one drive being protected by the ntfs protection where permissions are
required.
