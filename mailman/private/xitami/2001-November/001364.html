Nevertheless, including such a disclaimer on mails sent on the one-to-many
basis of a mailing list is consummately stupid, because YOU have no
control over the members of the set which your disclaimer calls &quot;intended
recipients&quot;, since members may join and leave the list at any time, and
in most cases any legislation upon which you are relying is positively
NOT applicable to the &quot;recipients&quot;.

I would advise anyone with such boilerplate inclusions to configure their
mailers so as NOT to send it when the addressee is a mailing list; ditto
for postings to newsgroups, where such disclaimers are equally risible.

PHBs require educating as to the differing modes in which e-mail might be
used: for them to issue an edict requiring such boilerplate on mails
which are not one-to-one (or one-to-few) merely reinforces just why they
ARE pointy-haired bosses.

during my brief visit to .cy]
