I ran my copy of LeechFTP, a simple windows-based client to test Frances's
theory. Indeed, I did see that the software issued a SYST command. Of
course, on my side of the router, it doesn't cause any problems. It is only
a problem for people on the outside of my network.

BTW, the possibility that the FTP client was causing the server to send my
internal IP is the original reason why I wanted to bag the TZO &quot;IP catching&quot;
client software and use xitami's imbedded client to retreive the IP. My
thought was that Xitami would pass the correct IP to the FTP server and
would send to the requesting FTP client my true &quot;internet&quot; IP, instead of
the IP I use on this side of the router.

One user reported that he could upload to me, but not download from me. This
is the person that reported seeing my local IP address, instead of my global
address as he should have seen it. Frances, is this consistent with your
diagnosis? Do you think there is a solution? Anyone else have any ideas?

Thanks.

-Carl.
