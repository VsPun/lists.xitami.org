<PRE>I would love to help.  I am not familiar with PHP, but have often thought of
what this would look and function like.  I too have similar concearns as
detailed below.

I can offer help with graphic interfaces and style sheets for a prestine
looking front end.

=============

Hi all:

Ok, is anyone interested in helping to develop a control panel type
application in
PHP for Xitami?

Here's the situation, I currently run 5 domains + 15 sub domains on my
xitami
server. Managing these have become cumbersome and creating new ones are not
much
easier ( I often have to directly edit the defaults.cfg file). Also if you
want to
allow people to manage they're own domains/subdomains as well as do checks
on
billing and what not then it becomes equally difficult since xitami doesn't
support
these features.
