<PRE>Not really certain how to do it because of they are stored.  I am looking at 
the old emails now.  How are they currently stored?  It would seem to me 
they are already in a database b/c they are sortable by 
date/threat/subject/author - to me that implies a database must be needed. 
In addition, all the threads from a single topic are grouped together thus 
implying, again, that they are all in a db.  If that is the case I think it 
would be pretty simple to convert them into a searchable database or convert 
them to a typical forum layout we see with so many of the discussion group 
sites today.

One simple script should be sufficient to convert the whole list, assuming 
one knows all the parameters.

This example of January 08: 
<A HREF="http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/2008-January/thread.html">http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/2008-January/thread.html</A>

The first thread is titled &quot;PHP and ASP inclusions for testing purposes&quot;, 
the next thread grouped with that first title is &quot;Dynamic URL Conversion to 
static URLs&quot;.  The second is a different topic and is grouped together with 
the first topic....why?  Is it because the second topic had an article ID 
related to the first and the subject was simply changed?  And then further 
on down, still under that first subject is another grouping titled &quot;Alias 
configs&quot;...that third topic is different from the previous two group topics 
but yet its included in the grouping...again, why?  Knowing these answers 
will def help the script writer.

Also, what happens if an exchange about a thread carries over from one month 
to a new month....say Jan 30th it starts but doesn't finish til about Feb 
3rd.  Does that mean half the article is archived in Jan and half in 
Feb...or is the entire article grouping archived in one or the other months 
listings?
