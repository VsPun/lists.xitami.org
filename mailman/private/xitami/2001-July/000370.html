I keep trying to tell people to re-install IE 5.5 and the security updates
first before re-installing Windows...and if they haven't, then do so.  IE
has _kernel updates_ embedded in it that will repair ailing OSes.  I've
literally brought PCs back from the dead (one had 4 different viruses on it
and they had trashed a lot of the data) just by (re)installing IE (which
restored the OS data - F-PROT took care of the remaining mess).

I don't use a real-time virus scanner either.  I just use a good ol' DOS
program called F-PROT and maintain my knowledge of how viruses *REALLY*
work (many people think they are magical and McAfee is magical too...or
something like that - guess what...neither are magical).  F-PROT is
freeware, scans more viruses than McAfee's bloated piece of junk, and is
the tool of choice for removing viruses from virtually-dead machines (even
viruses designed for Windows).

Finally, Xitami and CGIs will crash if there is not enough memory
available.  Suggestion:  Install RamIdle.  It is an excellent freeware
product.

Hope this helps!
