As others have noted, these headers are non-standard, and basically only
an IE/IIS communication channel.

However that said, Xitami tries to make all the headers that it gets
available as HTTP_... headers to CGI/filter/LRWP programs if that
option is turned on (it is by default: [cgi] http-fields=1 and [cgi]
http-prefix=HTTP_).  So in theory I would expect the headers that you
mention to be available like that as well.

If this isn't happening for some reason we'd need to look at whether IE
is passing them as &quot;real&quot; headers, or as something else that is special.
