Ah ha.  If you've got two things writing to the same temporary directory
using similar file names that could be bad.

We've always said that if you are going to run two instances of Xitami,
you should run them in different directories.  Obviously if you are
using dynamic content this should include different temp directories as
well.

I'm curious about the &quot;bazillion&quot; pipe files though -- which version of
Xitami are you using?  Do you have any debugging options turned on?
(We've had this issue reported before but I thought it had been resolved
providing the debug options were all off -- if the debug options are on,
Xitami keeps them around to assist with debugging.)
