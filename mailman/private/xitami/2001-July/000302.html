<PRE>Hi everyone:

If you have been following this thread, you will remember that I was 
able to get Xitami to deliver my local websites (ie on my hard drive) 
to my browser.  Because the current site I am developing cannot use 
SSI (their hosting package does not allow it and they don't want to 
pay for the upgrade), I have yet to test that feature.  However, 
absolute paths work perfectly.

The only drawback that I encounter is that everytime I want to 
browse a new page or refresh the current one, Win98SE wants me to 
connect to my ISP before it would show me the new page.  This was 
true with IE 5.5 and Opera 5.1 but when I tried Netscape 6.0, I found 
that I could cancel the dialup and it would show me the page I wanted 
to see.  Furthermore, because I cancelled the dialup, Netscape 6 did 
not ever ask for my ISP again which means that I can browse my 
&quot;local&quot; site as if I was not running Xitami.  It is slower than not using 
Xitami (I know that N6 is a bit of a pig too) but it is not 
unreasonable and the benefits of making my local site act like a 
&quot;true&quot; hosted site is tremendous.

Therefore, for anyone wanting to setup Xitami for the same 
purposes as myself would be recommended to use N6 as the test 
browser.

Jules
