<PRE>I am running two versions of Xitami, the standard, and the Pro.

I've been running the standard for several months with no problems,
but now I go to run the Pro alongside it, and everytime it starts, it
suspends itself. Is there any way around this? I checked the logs, and
it's not showing any errors at all. 

The FTP Server is shut off on both, and on the standard, HTTP runs on
port 80. On the Pro, I set a port base of 10, so HTTP runs at 90, but
HTTPS still runs at 443, it seems to be working fine, but just
suspends itself on start up.

Thank you for any ideas with this.
Jeff

Xitami normally only suspends itself (automatically) when it cannot
talk
to the network for some reason.  Looking in the log might give you
some
idea what it is having problems with (eg, the console.log) in
situations
like this.
