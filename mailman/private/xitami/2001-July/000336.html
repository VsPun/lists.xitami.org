<PRE>I did figure it out, it had to do with a port confliction that I had
missed. Just had to change the LWRP port in xitami.cfg, and that took
care of it. 

Thanks for your help.

Pro runs in console mode if you are running v2.4c1.  Just press Ctrl-C
to
stop it and it should shut down cleanly.  Not sure about more recent
versions of Pro.

If you put the standard version in the same directory as the Pro
version,
then there will be conflicts with the configurations (Xitami standard
might
be detecting changes to log files and thus suspends itself).  You
should
re-install both and put them in separate directories.  To make both
versions work well together in separate directories, point Pro's
Xitami.cfg
[Server]-&gt;webpages variable to the standard's webpages directory...be
sure
to spell out the directory path letter for letter (e.g. Program Files,
not
Progra~1) or you will get strange errors.  You can point Standard to
Pro,
they should just point to the same place.

Hope this helps!
