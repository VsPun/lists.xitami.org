</I>
There's two things that could be generating the 404: Xitami and PHP.
I can't remember off hand if Xitami logs a 404 only when it generates
it, or when that's the code it's going to return (which a CGI/filter can
supply).

Since the request/debug log entries you supply don't match up with the
times in the other snippets you supply, it's hard to know exactly what
is going on.

However I'd definitely suggest (a) looking for messages in cgierr.log,
and (b) adding something to the PHP so you can tell if it is being run.
The fact that Xitami seems to be trying to transfer .flt files (filter
files), suggests that something must have generated those files to
transfer.

You might also want to enable [cgi] debug=1 (which controls filtering
too) and let it preserve the filter files (normally they are removed
after being sent).  Then you can check the contents of those to see if
it is PHP that is writing the 404 error (or indeed if it is writing
anything).

Given that you seem to have a working PHP setup in general (since some
of your other PHP works) I suspect that looking closely at what the
problem PHP script is doing/trying to do has to be your next step.
