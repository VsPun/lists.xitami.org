</I>&gt;<i> That's too much of a pain in the neck if you ask me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question is, if you are using a static host for your site, why bother

</I>&gt;<i> look the same both locally and remotely (providing the remote host doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> use case-sensitive filenames...but that just requires a bit of
</I>fore-thought
&gt;<i> - and Xitami is _NOT_ a case-sensitive server under Windows).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the &quot;online&quot; and &quot;offline&quot; browsing modes do is determine whether to
</I>&gt;<i> use already cached pages or to get them from the remote server.  It really
</I>&gt;<i> has little relation to web page development since you want to be in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;online&quot; mode anyway or nothing will change when you reload the page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to have more power, you can host your own web page with
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami...which is what its true purpose is.  If all you are going to do is
</I>&gt;<i> create static webpages for some other host, you are probably missing the
</I>&gt;<i> point of a web server (the point is to serve web pages from your computer
</I>&gt;<i> to other people...not to test static pages to upload to geocities).  I
</I>&gt;<i> suggest checking out &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dhs.org/">http://www.dhs.org/</A>&gt;.  It may be a bit confusing for
</I>&gt;<i> you, but I highly recommend their dynamic DNS service if you want to host
</I>&gt;<i> your own website (and don't have a static IP address).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps!

My problem is that I want to create dynamic pages too and test if all the
links I wrote are correct and really poit to existent pages, simply using my
computer both as server and browser. It's a thing that is not connected to
geocities, that was just an example... I don't know if I need a server, but
I thought yes... Another question, where can I find informations about how
servers work? The Xitami manual start with a lot of things that you should
already know, but I need to start from the beginning.
Thanks again,
Franco
