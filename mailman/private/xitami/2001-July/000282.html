Did you get all of the Windows updates for your system?  Usually installing
IE 5.5 fixes a majority of the bugs in Windows (IE actually has kernel
updates embedded as part of the package...some people don't really care
about IE, but the updates to the OS are worth having).  I recommend
installing all of the security updates, then updating IE to v5.5, then
running the remaining security updates.  (BTW, don't install Windows Media
Player 7.1...it doesn't do anything more than 6.4 does except consume 7MB
more RAM).

If that doesn't work, try re-installing Xitami using a more stable release.

I'm running Xitami v2.4d7 without any problems (yeah, I know about the DoS
bug that's fixed in the latest version...just haven't installed it yet).

Xitami tends crash on low-memory machines or machines that run out of
memory.  If you run Xitami regularly, then I suggest getting something like
RamIdle (RamIdle is freeware and I haven't had problems with it compared to
other packages) to keep enough memory free for Xitami under Windows.  I
haven't had problems with Xitami since I have 384MB RAM and usually have
around 150MB free.

Hope that helps!
