good idea, but the line already was in there... maybe added by the
xitami install?

you're the winner Thomas... I checked my bookmarks, and they were indeed
entered as localhost/whatever. I changed to <A HREF="http://localhost/whatever,">http://localhost/whatever,</A>
and it seems to blaze right thru every time.

yes DHCP does go out and set all that up. I was just trying to give the
parameters of how my protocols are set up. The DHCP sets the
router/firewall as a local gateway 192.168.0.1 and goes out and gets the
DNS and assigned IP address from @home. 

thanx for your help!!
