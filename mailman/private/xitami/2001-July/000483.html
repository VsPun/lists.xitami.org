<PRE>hi i recently had to install php for one of my users, and knowing nothing
about it, went to the php site and found an installer file for php4

reading the info it said it worked for win with iis pws and xitami

of course i downloaded it and ran it but there was nothing in xitami

this turned out to be because i had a version that was running in the xiwin
dir and the new versions all run in the xitami dir

i downloaded the upgrade installed restarted and reinstalled php and it just
worked.

the file i downloaded was called php-4.0.3pl1-installer.exe

try it, you will all like it. and it will save you so much time posting
here.

for those not using xitami running from the xitami dir be aware that in
doing my upgrade i lost ssi and had to upgrade to the latest version to get
it back.
