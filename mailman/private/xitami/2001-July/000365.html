To start Xitami from another program is fairly simple to do (e.g. the
system() command in C).

To shut down Xitami from another program is a bit more difficult:
First, enumerate all the Windows and loop through them until you run into
the window name &quot;xiwin32&quot; or &quot;xitami&quot; or something like that.
Then, send a WM_QUIT message to it (or you could try sending the
appropriate message to suspend Xitami instead - WM_QUIT is easier, though).
 Xitami should shut down.

Look under the RAS Services section of MSDN for details on connection
information.

So, here is how your program would work:

1)  Wait for RAS to connect successfully to the Internet.
2)  Start Xiami.
3)  Wait for RAS to disconnect.
4)  Shut down Xitami.
5)  Repeat until you cause your program to quit.

I don't think there is any other way to accomplish what you want to do.
So, now might be a good time to learn how to write Windows programs.
Otherwise, keep searching - there is probably a utility, I just don't need
to use it (cable modems are very nice - 100-200K/sec transfers on avg.).
