You are referring to the lines that say:
PHP NOTE:  The line in the [Filter] section should look like this:
           .php=c:\cfusion\bin\XiFusion c:\php\php.exe

I assumed that XiFusion was installed in the c:\cfusion\bin directory when
I wrote the documentation.  You have to *manually* extract XiFusion.exe and
put it into a directory somewhere on your hard drive and replace
'c:\cfusion\bin' with the drive and directory where you put the XiFusion
executable (XiFusion.exe).  Note that there is NO fancy install program as
there is really only one necessary file and a 1MB installation program is
hardly necessary for a 65K executable.

BTW, this format of documentation is quite standard for DOS/Console
programs.  DOS is simple to use, but you have to know to translate path
names/drive letters in your head when reading readme.txt files since no two
computer systems are set up exactly the same.  XiFusion is really a Win32
Console mode program, thus I wrote the documentation using DOS
documentation standards in mind.

Also, when you start to work with web servers and interfacing CGI
applications (which is what PHP and ColdFusion really are), knowledge of
how to use DOS comes in quite handy.
