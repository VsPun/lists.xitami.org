&gt;<i>I would recommend your friend dumps the XP firewall and installs Zonealarm 
</I>&gt;<i>instead.
</I>&gt;<i>Zonealarm claims it's not made for servers but in fact it works just fine.
</I>&gt;<i>It is on top of that a build of outpost for linux somehow as it reports 
</I>&gt;<i>itself to be the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now, for the configuration, go into Advanced and allow odd servers to run 
</I>&gt;<i>under high security,
</I>&gt;<i>and then specify that port 80 and other standard access rights are ok. Then 
</I>&gt;<i>you should be set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>XP's firewall has little to no ability to specify any distinct settings and 
</I>&gt;<i>if it's only SP 1 then it's pretty much not worth anything anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>I had a few guys compare security on firewalls and it took them about 10 
</I>&gt;<i>minutes to get through all standard Windows firewalls but a NAT is 
</I>&gt;<i>something different.
</I>&gt;<i>It can be broken but will take them 4 - 6 hours and is so much easier to 
</I>&gt;<i>detect.

Wouldn't a hardware router be better?  It doubles as a firewall and adds an
extra layer that doesn't have a visible OS under it.  I've been under the
general impression that software-based firewalls only somewhat work, but
I've not heard of anyone with a hardware router and a solidly closed
network (i.e. only port 80 open on the outside) having problems.  I tried
ZoneAlarm out myself once and wasn't too impressed (it worked, but it
wasn't easy to use), but that was two years ago.  I don't know why, but I
feel &quot;safer&quot; with a fairly decent, web configurable hardware router than
sitting directly on the Internet hoping everything on the software firewall
works fine.  I'm probably being confidently geeky because shiny hardware is
supposed to be impressive.
