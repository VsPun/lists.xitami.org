<PRE>I would recommend your friend dumps the XP firewall and installs Zonealarm 
instead.
Zonealarm claims it's not made for servers but in fact it works just fine.
It is on top of that a build of outpost for linux somehow as it reports 
itself to be the same.

Now, for the configuration, go into Advanced and allow odd servers to run 
under high security,
and then specify that port 80 and other standard access rights are ok. Then 
you should be set.

XP's firewall has little to no ability to specify any distinct settings and 
if it's only SP 1 then it's pretty much not worth anything anyway.
I had a few guys compare security on firewalls and it took them about 10 
minutes to get through all standard Windows firewalls but a NAT is 
something different.
It can be broken but will take them 4 - 6 hours and is so much easier to 
detect.
