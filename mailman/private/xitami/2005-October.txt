Well, in that case, it's possibly
1) the router's PPPoE that doesn't work with the ISP*) (both are 
likely using very similar code as they are from the same 
manufacturer) or
2) your ISP's DHCP server having a very short lease time or being 
bonkers in some other way. Can't you eliminate the router as a cause 
by setting up a computer directly connected to the modem?

Try to get through to a real tech person, it would be most 
interesting to know if the DHCP server receives requests at a fixed 
interval, for example. They have all the possibilities to help you 
with your problem... if they want.

There is also always the option of buying your own DSL modem, or 
borrowing someone else's for a while, to eliminate one more problem.


(* I noticed it worked before, but they could have changed something 
on their side

Thanks. I managed to find it. It is not inside any preferences for IE, 

but on the dialup dialog box itself (you wouldn't ever see it if you're
directly connected) which IE brings up after you type the address in the
bar and hit return. 

Under the phone icon and the dialup number, there is a small
radio-select which asks something like whether to dial or never to dial.
You should opt for never and then click ok.

It might have something to do with a proxy or it might not. Can not say
- no clue on the radio options.

Thank you again.

Ayhan

If you're using IE and proxy server configs might try checking the
  "bypass proxy server for local addresses" under connections.

Go Bonkers, I do not use an English version of XP. Can you please point
me the way to the above?

I have found Verizon DSL to be notorious for blocking commonly used ports,  
and then charging an arm and a leg more per month to flip a switch and  
open them for you.

Good luck.

I had the opposite experience.  When I started with Verizon, all inbound 
traffic was blocked.  Somewhere down the line, without any warning, all 
inbound traffic was enabled.  I had no idea that had happened until I 
was playing around with Zone Alarm one day.  It started pumping out 
warnings on ports all over the place.  I very quickly checked and upped 
my security settings to make sure I was covered.

Since they were cavalier about letting me know that they had exposed me, 
I felt little guilt about setting up a web server on my machine.  As my 
DSL modem hasn't lost power (it's on a UPS) my IP hasn't changed in 
close to 6 months now.

But none of this is germain to the question.  It does sound like the ISP 
is blocking the inbound connections on port 21.

Hi Folks:

Some folks are informing me that, when they download a file from my server, and then proceed to the installation process, they are told that the setup files have been corrupted.

I have been able to download the same files with no problem.

Is there a setting that should be changed on my Xitami server?

Thanks much.

Hi Folks:

For some reason, when folks download files from my Xitami FTP server, they

Could someone help me to sort out this problem?

Hi Gang:

I've asked this question before; however, I received no response.

For some reason, many people who use Internet Explorer  to download from my Xitami FTP server are receiving corrupted files. There seems to be no problem for those using other FTP clients.

Any help would be appreciated all over the place.

The Xitami FTP server is only meant to be a temporary solution to get 
files up to the web server. It is nowhere near the quality of "real" 
FTP servers. This is even acknowledged by the developers. When I ran 
the Xitami FTP server, I often got interrupted uploads (I almost 
never downloaded from it).

Disable the Xitami FTP server and change to a different, good, real 
FTP server -- for Win32 for example GuildFTPd (a five minute setup) 
or WarFTPd (slightly more complicated but runs as a service 
natively).

Sorry to be negative, but that's the way it is.

I have been successfully hosting a small website with Xitami for some years now. I am currently using version 2.52c as a service, running on Windows XP. The site layout was recently changed, and at the request of the designer I added php (current version, 5.0.5). The new site came up about a month ago with php plus some java scripts, and it also calls for Macromedia's Flash Player plugin. The earlier incarnations of the website just ran straightforward html, and they virtually never crashed. However, the new site has gone down two or three times a week. When it does go down and I check the server, either I can't log on or I get "Insufficient system resources" OS error messages. Either way, there is nothing I can do except reboot, and then everything is fine -  for a few days until the next crash. The crash log does not have a listing, and the other logs haven't given me anything useful. Configuration tweaks I have tried have not helped, and there is no evidence of any hardware problems.

 

I have started to experiment some with using the applications, both the GUI and console version, rather than the service. I seem to be having a little more success with them. At least it I just have to restart the application rather than the whole computer.

 

Well, I have got to have better stability than this, even if it means switching to another web server. But I have grown fond of Xitami over the years and would like to keep using it if I can. If anyone knows of something else I should look into on this, I would appreciate hearing about it.

 

Thanks a lot.

This sounds like a memory leak problem. I would use some type of utility to
see how much memory each program is using right after reboot and then a few
hours later and then again the next day, You may be able to gauge what
program is causing the problems. I run Xatami and PHP together and have
never had any problems. You may even be able to make a good guess at which
program is leaking memory by using task manager.
