<PRE>I finally got xitame, php, and mysql to run on a thumb drive.  No  
&quot;installation&quot; of any files onto the host computer needed.  Just plug it  
in, run a batch file to start the programs, and start browsing.

It seems most of the trick was to make sure that all .ini files use  
relative addressing, so that everything works regardless of what drive  
letter your computer assigns to the thumb drive.  Because of this, the  
directory structure of the thumb drive cannot be changed, although  
anything under xitami/webpages/ is up to you.

I use it to demonstrate my php/mysql pages on localhost, but I'm sure the  
computer will listen and respond on whatever addresses you put in  
xitami.cfg.  The total size of the install is about 50 meg plus whatever  
size your database is, plus whatever session variables you might have  
running.  Logging of the web server is turned off.  Security is not a big  
concern for my purposes.

If anyone would like a step-by-step, copies of the .ini files, etc. feel  
free to ask.  It might be a week or two before I can get back to you,  
since I now have to take this package to a few spots around the country  
and demonstrate my pages.

If this has already been done, I apologize for taking up your time!

Michael
