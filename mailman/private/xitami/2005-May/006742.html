<PRE>Here is what I am going to use it for. I do a website for a coupl of
businesses which are all done with Xitami, PHP and mySQL. I'll put their
site on a thumbdrive and send it to them. That way they will have a back up
and if necessary can take it with them to conventions and confrences. As you
know, you don't aways have access to the internet but this will allow them
to pull up their site even though there is no access.

MySQL is the only part I don't have working so that will be a big step for
me.

Ron

Here's what I'll do....I'm going away this weekend, but the beginning of
next week I'll do a couple of web pages with instructions to set up your
thumb drive, and I'll put them on....my thumb drive server, plug it in,
and give you all the web address.    :-)  I used it for a lecture I did
tonight, and it worked quite well.
