  Thanks Ron, &quot;AND Lois&quot;

  I have about decided that I am also having problems with the cgi script=
=20
itself, for the following reasons, unless someone here might recognize=20
something else I should do.
  I CAN make the opening page &quot;template file&quot; include the index.cgi file=20
which allows me to set that page up using html etc;  HOWEVER, the script=20
automatically builds additional pages as you go, (it's like a blog or bb=20
script), as well as it auto-prints page numbers &quot;on the fly&quot;  ie: [Page:=20
1.2.3...] into that page, BUT that first page is the ONLY page that seems t=
o=20
be using the &lt;include&gt;!!  IOWs when you click one of the additional page #s=
,=20
you are sent directly to the index.cgi instead of everything remaining=20
inside of the template page....  hope @ makes sense!!   So although I AM=20
able to link to the template.shtml page where it is working correctly, and=
=20
the index.cgi is included into the html design etc; once you click to go to=
=20
another page of the script, all of this is gone!   Sorry so long and=20
confusing, but I really do appreciate all of your help and consideration. =
=20
Have a good day!  harthon

I think you should look within the script you are using and see if
there is a place where it is including a header or footer for the
pages other than the first page - which uses your template.   Or where
you can create a space to include what you are trying to include and
then use the 'sub include' I offered in my previous post to call it
within the script itself rather than just in the template.   I've done
this with other scripts.

Lois
