OK.  It's smthttp.c, and smthttpl.c.  smthttp.c is built using Libero and has 
an animation ability (you need Libero installed):

 - lr -animate smthttp.l
 - rebuild

This shows what the HTTP agent in the server does when the request comes in.  
You can test with a local (working) filtered file and an aliased (failing) 
filtered file.  If there's a difference in the animation trace, that makes 
the problem easy to find.

Next, smthttpl.c does most of the hard work of handling a HTTP request.  There 
are two or three main functions that check the type of file, resolve aliases, 
etc.  You'd have to start with the code in smthttp.c and follow it as it 
calls these functions (you can see which ones, they are printing the debug 
statements you reported in your email).
