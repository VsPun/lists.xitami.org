<PRE>  At a glance, mine is surely not the dumbest question ever asked here, so 
i'm going to try this again since I've fought with it for this darn long 
now!

  It has got to be something I'm doing 'or not doing' here, because I know 
there is 'a way' to make an &quot;include&quot; work on my server, either with or 
without ssi..  Testing as free script that uses a template.html page with &quot; 
&lt;!--content--&gt; &quot; as it's only place-holder for the index.cgi page of the 
script, I have tried it both inside and outside of the cgi-bin, and with 
every possible cfg and place-holder I can think of, but I still cannot 
&quot;include&quot; the file!  Someone &quot;please&quot; steer me in the right direction here 
to make this work!  Anything that anyone can tell me to try, to include a 
file in another, I will certainly give it a shot!  Thanks ANYONE!    harthon
