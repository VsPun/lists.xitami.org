<PRE>I do know that for includes to work such as:  &lt;!--#include virtual=3D&quot;site=
foot.txt&quot;--&gt; it is going to 
look for the file you are including in the main web page directory of your=
 server (i.e. 
/webpages) and it will not show if you place the file within a subdirector=
y of /webpages where 
you may have your template.html file.

If you want to include a .txt file within a scipt what I use is:

sub include {
# --------------------------------------------------------
# This is text to include. Use like an SSI.

my $file =3D shift;
open (FILE, &quot;&lt;$file&quot;) or die &quot;Can't open $file ($!)&quot;;
print &lt;FILE&gt;;
close FILE;
}
## Then add this line wherever you want file included:

 |; 
&amp;include (&quot;dbside.txt&quot;);
print qq|

I use this for many scripts to include a footer and side menu within my di=
splays.   Especially 
for hosts sites which don't always allow SSI.

Hope this help :)
