<PRE>I always enjoy these forums....even after 6 years of use I constantly learn little tid bits that ultimately help me better manage Xitami.  A recent post about PHP and CGI processes made me wonder about a few things.  hopefully some folks here have some insights into these items.

I recently learned that PHP, in Xitami, is actually run as a CGI process....if thats true then I see no benefit in running PHP scripts - what advantage would PHP have over CGI.  Maybe smaller more adaptable HTML coding can be achieved with PHP, but as far as the server is concerned, a PHP script will still generate a CGI process.  Yes/No?

What kind of load issues can Xitami handle?  I run Xitami v2.4d9 on a W2K Adv Server, 2gig of memory on a dual core pentium 3.2ghz processor.  However, I expecting my server to take an immense amount of hits....every link on my site is a perl script.  And nearly every perl script does at least 3 or 4 mysql queries to pull data needed for the html pages.  What if a 1,000 users hit my site at the same time, can Xitami handle it - can the server cpu/memory/xitami handle approx 1000 perl.exe running at the same time?  What about 2,000 or more?  Who has extensive experience with load issues on Xitami that could comment on this, how to deal with these issues and ultimately suggestions on how to optimize windows and xitami to have the best performance?  I only have one domain, bound to an IP address - so not virtual hosting is occuring.

What is going to break first?

I personally love this one, old but I wonder if others can comment on whether or not this 5 year old article is still applies in todays web server market:

Most interesting in this one is the &quot;CPU Usage&quot; at the bottom: <A HREF="http://www.networkinformation.com/xitami.php">http://www.networkinformation.com/xitami.php</A>

anyone have other comments to add on this subject?
