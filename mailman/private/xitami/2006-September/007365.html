<PRE>I used the web based interface for about a week. Now I have some dos scripts
that do the work for me. Sure it means I have to be sitting at the server. I
could probably do the same with PHP but I'm too lazy to do it. 

As far as the log files goes.

In the config for each site I have this


[Accesslog]
   Filename = &quot;mysitename.log&quot; 


In the xitami.cfg I have this

#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   ACCESSLOG configuration section
#
#   This section controls the server access log, recording HTTP hits.

[Accesslog]
#   Specifies whether logging is enabled or not.

    enabled=1

#   Specifies the name of the log file.

    filename=access.log

#   Specifies whether to include local addresses or not.

    local=1

#   Specifies the log file format. The log file format you use needs
#   to be compatible with whatever tool you use to analyze log files
#   and build statistics. The most common tools work with an extended
#   form of the NCSA log file format, also called 'common log file
#   format'. We call this &quot;CLFX&quot;. An other commonly-used format is
#   that produced by Microsoft web servers. Xitami also creates log
#   files in two XML formats, which you can easily process using
#   GSLgen to you create arbitrary reports, statistics, and HTML
#   analyses. Lastly, you can create your own format, for specific
#   purposes. Impressed? We are... :-)

    format=CLF

#   Custom log file format. This is an arbitrary text string that
#   contains symbols as listed below. Symbols are enclosed by $\( and
#   ) in the string.

    custom=

#   Specifies whether to do reverse-DNS translations of the logged IP
#   addresses, or not. Reverse-DNS translation can take some time, and
#   if you need log file data quickly, leave this disabled. Enabling
#   reverse-DNS translations will not slow- down Xitami.

    translate=0

#   Specifies when to cycle the log file. When Xitami cycles a log
#   file, it first moves or copies the existing data to another file,
#   then creates a new, empty log file.

    cycle=daily

#   Specifies how to cycle the log file.

    cycle-how=rename

#   Specifies the time of day, or minute past the hour, that the log
#   file is cycled.

    cycle-time=00:00

#   Specifies the day of the week or month that the log file is
#   cycled.

    cycle-day=0

#   Specifies the maximum size in Kbytes for the log file; after that
#   it is cycled.

    cycle-size=0

#   Specifies the maximum size in lines for the log file; after that
#   it is cycled.

    cycle-lines=0

#   Specifies an argument used for the various cycle-how options. When
#   renaming a file or concatenating it onto another, Xitami uses the
#   argument as a time-stamped filename. When moving the file, Xitami
#   uses the argument as a time-stamped directory name. When
#   processing the file through an arbitrary command, it uses the
#   argument as a time-stamped command string. Xitami does not use the
#   argument when deleting log files. Format this argument from any of
#   the following timestamp fiels, mixed with other text.

    cycle-arg=ac%yy%mm%dd.log


#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   ERRORLOG configuration section
#
#   This section controls the server error log, recording HTTP errors.

[Errorlog]
#   Specifies whether logging is enabled or not.

    enabled=1

#   Specifies the name of the log file.

    filename=errors.log

#   Specifies whether to include local addresses or not.

    local=1

#   Specifies the log file format. The log file format you use needs
#   to be compatible with whatever tool you use to analyze log files
#   and build statistics. The most common tools work with an extended

i have never like the web based interface and have read about people having
trouble with it many times over the years that i've been on this list.

manually editing the cfg files it quick and simple. that is how i have
always done my confguring.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why don't you post your logging config?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Errorlog]

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Format=CLFX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Server]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    log-dir=D:\logs\Xitami
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> Interestingly enough, those entries do not exist in any form in my
</I>&gt;<i> defaults.cfg, nor in the cfgs for each of the virtual hosts. I know that
</I>&gt;<i> I have made the entries in the web based admin to enable and format the
