<PRE>Hi All
I don't usually reply to these articals, but i read quite a lot of them, i =
am a developer and designer i usually work in php, but i do some work in =
ASP you can see some of the sites i have worked with below
www.freedauk.com
www.peoples-tribute.com

and i have tried both xitami and key focus and by far the best one in =
xitami key focus i found to be diffcult to get the functuonally of the php =
and asp complete, and for what i do it was not robus enough and quite =
diffcult to configure.
There said my bit.
Regards
Mike
