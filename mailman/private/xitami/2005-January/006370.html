<PRE>I totally agree Johannes.

I now run 16 domains on virtual or dedicated xitami servers and toss out 260
Gb a month easily over those domains.

Two of my domains have an expected hit ratio of 1,000,000 plus hits per year
with 3000 images in catalouges
and some are only used for company related extranet data solutions.

I have had ONE failure in the past three months and that was my mailserver
hanging and had nothing to do with the domains.

One of the machine I had not even rebooted for 3 months with Win 2K on it.

Stabile and simple are the keywords.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a look at it yesterday, but I have to say that I like xitami over
</I>keyfocus. What I like most
&gt;<i> is, you unzip it ,no messing around with the registry and editing the
</I>necessary config files.
&gt;<i> Ones you understand the way it's handeld, the changes are quick and easy
</I>done. It took me a while
&gt;<i> and with some hints from the list I was on my way. :)
