<PRE>&gt;<i>  All I'm interested in doing with IIS is learning more about ASP
</I>
Either get in bed with Bill Gates or stay the heck away from ASP.

Anything ASP can do, can be done in PHP or Perl or other
many-platform tools.

&gt;<i> as well as perhaps throwing up some quick &quot;MS Access web data sheets&quot;
</I>
The other MS Office products can &quot;Save As.. Web Page.&quot; This makes a
rather bloated HTML but most browsers can swallow it. I do not know
if Access offers this. Certainly you can fetch data out of an Access
database with 3rd-party tools and display it to the Web.

&gt;<i> all www.blah.com requests to 111.111.111.111:1080
</I>
DNS does not supply port numbers. Give each webserver its own IP.

Relative links will stay on the same port. So a link on Xitami:80
could get you to Apache:1080 and once there you would stay on
Apache:1080

&gt;<i> Would keeping IIS on a port other then 80 make it less likely to
</I>&gt;<i> be hit by the 20K of hack attacks I get in the Xitami logs every day?
</I>
How do we know if they are hacking IIS or Xitami? At the peak of
Code Red I was getting 20K of bogus hits a day, and IIS/PWS is
banned in my world. But there are tools to scan for IIS and having
it alive on any port is like throwing cheese on the floor and asking
why the place is full of mice.
