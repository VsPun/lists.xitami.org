Subject: [Xitami] Unconditional execution of a CGI in html.
Message-ID: <021020092221.3871.4991FDF700029AE000000F1F22243429029B0A02D29B9B0EBFCC090201040906@att.net>


Hello,,,,,   :) :)

I tried to find a search method to look in the Xitami Archives for the situation described below with no luck.

As a newbie using Xitami and Web Pages I have some experience but not a lot of day-to-day activity working with Xitami and/or HTML to find a solution for the following.

I was looking for the method in HTML to unconditionally execute a cgi program 
in html without user action (i.e.) using an "image", "a href", "form field", etc.  

The intent is to record Xitami variables, etc. to a file on the server when the page is accessed plus in some cases output text to the Browser window that has accessed that Web Page .

Several methods were found on a google search showing SSI, etc.(#exec, etc.) and none seem to work.

The cgi program can be executed with the entry to the Browser address window of:

   http://IP_of_Xitami/cgi-bin/TEST_CGI_PROGRAM?Argument1+Argument2,,,,,,,

And, the cgi programm runs as expected with the arguments found and recorded as well as a display of text to the Browser window where the above http:// is entered.

The ADMIN of Xitami was used to review the settings for that WEB Page CGI and 
these seem to be set to cause this to happen for that WEB Page. But, I am not 
sure if a settings is required and has been overlooked and needs to be set to 
cause this to happen.

Or, the HTML code to cause this to happen has not been used properly in the HTML 
code of that WEB Page.

THANKS for your time, help, and advice!!!!   :) :)

What do you mean 'unconditionally execute a cgi program without user 
interaction' ???

CGI execution can only happen if someone goes to a website or clicks a link 
within a website.  I suppose you could make automated calls via javascript 
with onMouseOver, or onMouseOut (or even a few other ones).  However, all 
those techniques still require a user visiting the webpage just to 
initialize those actions.

Please rephrase, clearly, what is you are looking to do.

Subject: [Xitami] ftp problems
Message-ID: <C626E77A0DEB41EBB66DB4C80F670FEC@Gary>

Until recently I've used the ftp server in Xitami with no problems at all.
On one installation I've having problems.  The client connects just fine but
beyond that point it does not seem to communicate.

There are the things that have changed that co-inside with the problem:

1.	Xitami was moved to a VISTA OS machine.
2.	The router (Lynksys) was changed in order to be compatible with
VISTA (IPv6)
3.	Both XP and VISTA received some major updates.

When I move Xitami back to the XP machine on this network I still have the
problem so I'm thinking the problem is with the router.

Hopefully someone else has experienced this problem and solved it.

Thank you,

Hello Gary,

It's typically a router or firewall problem.

Ask the client to use passive transferts (PASV command).

The procedure to switch to passive transferts depends on the FTP client
used.

It's always the FTP client that decides to switch to passive mode, you
can't set the server to use PASV

Hello  rolinger and  Hogan Courrier ,,,,,,  :) :)

THANKS for the replies,,,,,        :) :)


Hogan,,,,,, :) :)

I'll give that link a try ----THANKS....!!!  :) :) <:)



rolinger,,,,,, :) :)

For a Web Page that already exists and visited (displayed) by a Browser, it is the HTML code in that Web Page that will force the execution of a CGI without any user action that is required such as the HTML "a href,,,," or "form field". Also, even having to use the HTML "image,,,,," (i.e.)(poking on a link, or entering data to a form field, or the action of an HTML "image,,,,,URL/cgi-bin/program?argument1+Argument2,,,,"). 

It is similar to the execution of a CGI counter. Most of these counters that I have seen use the HTML "<img src="/cgi-bin/counter?a+b+c+d,,,,">" which creates a graphic file containing the counter value where a,b,c,d,,, control the format of how the counter will display and then outputs that graphic file to the Web Page at the Browser.

In this case it is a simple CGI that records Xitami variables, etc. at the Xitami Server. And, the user of the Browser does not have to poke on any item (link, etc.)in the display of the Web Page for that CGI to execute. And, the HTML does not use any "Image,,,,," to execute the CGI.

If you want I can send you an example of what has been tried. We even tried to see if SSI would work in the HTML of that Web Page such as:  

    <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/test?A+B+C"-->

    

Thanks for your time, help, and advice!!!!    :) :)

Jerry

Message-ID: <BAY127-DAV128D87C5D27BF4AF42A645F8BA0@phx.gbl>

I think I get what you are referring to.  You are looking to automatically 
have a link/script called from within an existing web page.  The 'image' 
rendering example you gave below would be one way to do it.  The other way 
is to use javascript to execute during on "onLoad" in the HEAD or in the 
<body> tag itself.  Though the javascript method would most likely require 
sending the cgi script to a target iFrame or something.  I don't think there 
is a way to get javascript to render external CGI within the same page 
itself.

However, if you are calling trying to call CGI within a static page, why not 
just make the whole page dynamic, so that as the page itself is rendered and 
calling the page counters at the same time.

I use image src=/cgi-bin in two locations on my site, they use perls Imager 
to create/edit/output images on the fly so they don't have to be stored on 
the harddrive, but realize that if you are calling an image cgi script on 
the fly that it is being called and rendered while the current page is also 
still being loaded.  But AFTER the page if fully loaded there will be no way 
to automatically call CGI scripts (unless you did a Javascript delayed timer 
type function).

Links from GETs (href) or POSTs (forms) are called upon user interaction of 
some sort.  Image src=/cgi-bin/etc... might be the only way to do 
this...also realize that SSI is executed, just like an image src=/cgi-bin, 
as the page is rendering - an not after it is rendered.

Even after your second explanation I am still not 100% clear on what it is 
you want...but I hope the above helps.

Hello rolinger,,,,,   :) :)

Wow,,,,,THANKS for that quick reply!!!!!

Here is an HTML example:

 <html>
 .
 .
 <body>
 .
 .
 HTML1  USE AN HTML STATEMENT TO EXECUTE A CGI PROGRAM and execute it without using <image,,,>, 
 HTML2  <a href,,,>, or any HTML that will require the user to poke on something.
 <!--  The use of <image,,,,> creates an undesirable graphic with no information.-->
 <!--  The use of <a href,,,,> or <form field,,,,> requires the user to poke on something-->
 .
 .
 </body>
 </html>

The desire here is not to use any embedded HTML Script (i.e.) java,,,,,,


In the mean time since my last Email ..... I found that the following use of an <Iframe,,,,> will do the trick:

<iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden; width: 100px; height: 50px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" src="/cgi-bin/test?Iframe,,,"></iframe>

The above HTML1 and HTML2 lines were replaced by the above <iframe,,,,,> lines and this works as expected.

The "test" cgi program gets executed, the Xitami desired variables, etc. are recorded to a file on the Xitami Server. The files expected to be written by "test" are created with "open append"  and contain the information expected. 

In this case, the <iframe,,,> creates the standard frame graphic to the Web Page Browser with the scroll up/down plus nothing is in the iframme.

In the mean time we decided to use the <iframme,,,> to display relative information sent to stdout by the "test" cgi program with print(i.e.) "Date and Time of visit". The print to stdout by "test" of this information is displayed in that iframme graphic at the Browser.
Now, we did find the use of <image,,,,> will execute the "test" cgi but it displays an unwnated graphic at the Web Page Browser with nothing in that graphic. 

It would be nice to get the "test" to execute and not use any HTML that creates a graphic (<image> or <iframme>)or requires a user to poke on something (<a href> or <form field>)etc. using some other HTML.

I tried the  <font,,,,,,src="cgi-=bin/test,,,",,,,> but the "test" cgi does not execute,
also SSI <!--#exec,,,,-->

So, with the <Iframme,,,,> all is now working. Your comments make sense and these will help to continue trying other HTML to find a way. 


THANKS for your comments, help, advise, and time!!!!!!!      :) :)

Not necessarily.

<img style="display: none;" src="/cgi-bin/foo.cgi" />

...will generate a HTTP request for the image, while not showing it at 
all in a CSS-capable browser.

You can also load it with an iframe having the same style attribute.

You can use XMLHttpRequest but that seems like a slight case of 
overkill. Plus, it relies on JS being activated.

Ahh that ol' chestnut! An <img tag is your best method as Magnus said
(Iframes? Noooo!) But this has method has a slight twist to ensure 100%
backwards compatibility with old browsers that get thrown off the rails at
even the hint of css...


<img src="/cgi-bin/yourapp">

Now, and here's the clever part, your CGI is executed a cgi script from the
<img tag - but your problem is that you *have* to return an image (even if
it is just a 1px by 1px transparent gif)

Clear as mud? Well, here's how I'd do it (yes, it's in VB. Pack it in before
you even start with the VB slating!)

   'convert the hex values of the hex-coded image to bytes.
   ImgHex =
"47494638396101000100800000000000FFFFFF21F90401000000002C0000000001000100000
20144003B"
   
   sImage = ""
   For x = 1 To Len(ImgHex) Step 2
      sImage = sImage & Chr$("&H" & Mid$(ImgHex, x, 2))
   Next x

The next few lines would be your own code. When you're ready to finish up,
just send out...

   "Status: 200 OK" & vbCrLf
   "Content-type: image/gif" & vbCrLf
   sImage

...via your chosen method (writing to cgi_stdout is good enough to)


To make sure that you are indeed sending a blank gif - tag this somewhere to
test:

    Open "C:\test.gif" For Output As #1
        Print #1, sImage
    Close #1

And open test.gif in your favourite paint application. Lo! A 1x1 transparent
gif.



I'm not a hundred percent certain if all of this is my own code or not (I've
thrown together quite a few vb cgi apps now and have pulled this from one of
them). Best guess is that it is - because the coding is somewhat sloppy ;)

Good luck!

Here is an HTML example:

The "test" cgi program gets executed, the Xitami desired variables, etc. are
recorded to a file on the Xitami Server. The files expected to be written by

In this case, the <iframe,,,> creates the standard frame graphic to the Web

The <image...> solution is going to be the only valid one that does not require user interaction or javascript.  And if your implementation of the <image...> method is producing an incorrect or empty image, then that merely implies your CGI script that generates the image is the source of the problem.  I am unaware of any HTML/CSS/Browser issue that woud not permit the image from being rendered properly.

However, if you continue to have issues I suggest you use a web design/html forums site for further support.  The Xitami forum is meant for server issues and server help, not coding problems.

Hello Russel, Magnus, and Stuart,

THANKS for your Time, Advice, and Help,,,,   :) :)_

In the beginning with what appeard to be an HTML method to do this the cgi program was not being unconditionally executed as described. With the replies a method is now doing this. 

Thanks Magnus for the reply showing how to use the <img,,,,,>

>>      Not necessarily.
>>
>>      <img style="display: none;" src="/cgi-bin/foo.cgi" />
>>
>>      ...will generate a HTTP request for the image, while not showing it at 
>>         all in a CSS-capable browser.



THANKS for all the comments,,,,this helpd,,,  :) :) :)

Subject: [Xitami] New X5 website, downloads
Message-ID: <5821ea240902180604o60db9c18pf04db13a91d436e1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We've released an X5 binary for Windows, and will have proper source
kits shortly.

Installation on Windows is trivial: pop the .exe onto a directory in
your path, run it.  'xitami -h' gives help.

I redesigned the xitami.wikidot.com website this morning, and it'll
move to www.xitami.com.  If you edit pages, or submit issues, you'll
get emails when someone adds a comment.  This is quite fun.

Sorry for spamming both lists here.  We'll stick to xitami-dev for all
development discussions, so anyone who wants to follow those, make
sure you're registered on xitami-dev.

It'll take a few more hours for the DNS changes to complete.

Cheers!

-Pieter

Hi Peter, downloaded but there is no executable in the package, just a

Greed is good, so long as you're able to help in the community.
Anyone wanting to help drive development (even if it's to test new
features), please join the dev list.
