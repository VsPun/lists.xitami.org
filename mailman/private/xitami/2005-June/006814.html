<PRE>Now that I've gotten good at virtual hosting, to look back at the manual is
to see a lot of &quot;oh that's what they were talking abouts.&quot;  Prior to that,
the instructions were confusing in rather subtle ways.  Each part may seem
simple, but as a whole, it took me a year to get the courage to go for it.
The Vhost Wizard actually did the work.  I just went in to clean it up and
add associated domains.

The process is not as self-evident from the front end as it is hind sight
and I would suggest a little tolerance and restraint for the newbies.
That's what mentors do.  And they may help you someday.

And yes, I did read the manual.  Several times.  Even printed the
appropriate pages (to print more would be a waste of trees).  Took notes.

They are called reference manuals for a reason.  And I remember those huge
green binders that DEC put out for VAX.  Neglected reading them but opted
for the IBM 360 Error Messages and Codes as my nightstand fare.  Put me out
faster and didn't weigh as much.

Smile folks,
Charles

All,

To configure virtual hosts, you have to know two things.  First, what
this means and how it works technically.  For that, the Xitami manual
is pretty detailed and I'd say, yes, RTFM.  It's the authoratitive
explanation.  Second, how to set the server config files to actually
make a new vhost.  Since there are several options, the advice of
others may help.
