<PRE>If you switch the 8.3 naming off aren't you limited to 128 characters in the
path string and wouldn't you have to limit the file and directory names to 8
characters?

Hello !

There are no limitations on the number of files a directory can hold.
Windows is very fast at accessing files.
I've done some testing with directories containing 20.000 files, any file
can always be retrieved in less than 500 ms (PIII 600MHz with windows 2000
server)

The problem will not be the amount of files but the expected traffic
(photos are typically very large).

It's important that the drive is defragmented every week or so.
Begin with a clean, formatted disk (best NOT to use the windows system
disk).
Check that the MFT (master file table) is not fragmented (this can only be
archieved by using a newly formatted disk or partition). The MFT contains
all the links to the files, and it's important that this file does not
become fragmented, as a defragmenter is not able to defragment it.
Use a second disk and not a partition, this will ensure fast access.
And use at least 512 MB of ram (windows will use part of it to store the
file list).

If you have more than 10.000 effective users (with some 100 users online at
any moment), you should consider professional solutions like load
balancing, cluster systems, fail over, ....

Xitami on itself is as good as the underlying OS. Don't use the included
FTP server with high volume transfers as it is not very stable under heavy
load (it's fine for small files). Xitami itself is very stable, typically
running for months and not needing any reboot. For such a demanding
application, don't install anything else on the server, and stop most
windows services.

Don't use the indexing service, switch the 8.3 naming off, don't use
compression, ...
Dynamic disks are not better than basic disks when it comes to speed (You
only should use dynamic disks if you plan to use partitions spanning
multiples disk, that's the only reason for using dd)
A raid 01 is a good thing too for your data disk.
