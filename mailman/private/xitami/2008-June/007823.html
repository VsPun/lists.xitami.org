<PRE>VISTA, crashes, etc.What 'user' are you referring to?  The way it reads is that any user accessing the site, the first one to see the message has the option to abort your reboot or allow it to happen...can you clarify that?  That sounds a tad unsecure.

With all that effort, why not just use your script to stop and restart the Xitami service - if it doesn't recover after that, then have the system reboot. 9 out of 10 times, a service restart fixes the problem - its quicker, cleaner and less intrusive.

  Subject: [Xitami] VISTA, crashes, etc.


  I have Xitami running on several machines at several locations.  All but one are running XP sp2.  The exception is running VISTA.  I get a rare crash at all but one site.  That site is the most stable and I don't have a clue why.  It is running a raid drive array (the only site that does) so that might be the reason.


  Most of my CGI processes are written in VB 6 sp2.  I do have a few BATs that do utility things like back-ups and kick of sessions in a database that supports this feature.  All that works exceptionally well.  I use Xitami  for more than just web sites.  It is the server that puts in nTier in my network.  I have my home grown server that operates as a fileserver and I use that on ports other than 80.  The reason I use Ximati for a fileserver enabler is that some of my user's company policy does not allow a tunnel through their firewall for any other port.  Besides, Ximati works so well for that it's hard to ignore it.

  All the above brings me to my point.  Since an unrecovered crash is so bad for me, I just wrote a VB routine to access the site via winhttp ever minute.  If it fails to get a response it will become visual, warn the person using the machine that it will reboot in 1 minute.  If the user does not abort the reboot it reboots and Xitami restarts on the reboot.  I don't attempt to clear the error nor restart Xitami, it's just cleaner to reboot.

  I have the option to have it send me a text message to my cell phone to tell me.

  If anyone would like to have a copy of the VB executablable I'll modify it (right now I hardcode the url) so that you can configure it for the url you want checked.  Just let me know and I'll do the mod and post it to my website.
