&gt;<i> I'm curious though, why people want to run multiple instances of
</I>&gt;<i> xitami? To use a different port?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
basically to run on a different port...I have a mutli-IP'd NIC and run my 
production web server on one IP:port, and wish to run a second development 
web server on the same machine but on a seperate IP:port.  Xitami does 
support virtual hosts and so forth but I was finding it to confusing to 
recall which files I was working on and wished to completely seperate out 
development from production files.  Eventually I will be just moving all 
development onto a completely dedicated development machine...but that might 
not happen for a while.

&gt;&gt;<i> If you get this ISAPI to work with Xitami def let me know...I would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highly interested in getting it to work on mine server, however, I am a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> put off by having to convert all my perl to some other language - mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I don't know the other languages.  Even PHP on Xitami is a CGI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process - not even true PHP.  I have always been aware of the CGI
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since you are familiar with scripting languages, I would suggest you
</I>&gt;<i> to take a look at Python. It's a very nicely designed language and
</I>&gt;<i> the Python LRWP module works (in my brief testing.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I will look into it, thanks.
