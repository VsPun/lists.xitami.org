Subject: [Xitami] SSL configuration (intermediate / chain)
Message-ID: <48D2649B.30607@rogers.com>

I have just acquired a SSL certificate from Network Solutions for 
several domains I have.  On another system I'm using a different web 
server and it all works fine.  On the server with Xitami, I get a prompt 
in the web browser about accepting the certificate or I can examine.

I believe this is due to the chain or intermediate certificate being 
required.  On the other server, this has been setup.

Is there an option in the 'sslhttps.cfs' file that I need other than:
cert-key
cert-file
ca-cert-path
ca-cert-file

Thanks,
Peter
