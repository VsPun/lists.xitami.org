Hmmm, the Xitami packages on xitami.com are downloaded via HTTP not
FTP, and the downloads should work just fine.

The Xitami FTP server is buggy, yes. Bad code, written by a sloppy
programmer, and we've never had the time to fix it.  We have said some
time ago that for production FTP usage, you will be wise to use a real
FTP server.  Xitami's FTP is useful mainly for uploading files to web
sites, and it works fine for this.

For users having trouble downloading responses from Xitami, you should
check whether you're using the last version.  There were some bugs in
the past that caused CGI output to be truncated in some cases.

I'm sorry not to be able to provide better news, such as updates and
fixes.  Xitami has been frozen for some time.  We keep the web site
and these lists up, and we make security patches, but the
functionality is on ice until someone gives us or we find the money to
make a new version.

Cheers,
