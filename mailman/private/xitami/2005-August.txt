Subject: [Xitami] Directory listing.
Message-ID: <000e01c59687$cd7f23a0$6400a8c0@maincomputer>

Hi Folks:

Perhaps someone can help me with a problem.  I am able to access my FTP 
Xitami server from two of three computers.  On the third computer, I am not 
able to get a directory listing.  This happens whether I use FileZilla or 
FTP Explorer.  I can, however, access the directory through Internet 
Explorer.

Can someone help me to understand why I cannot access my server with FTP 
clients?

Thanks all over the place gang.

The FTP protocol uses two ports.
One is the control port (normally port 21).
Data and the directory listing is transmitted over a second port. How this 
happen depends on the client: normal or 'passive'.

Basically, you need to switch the passive mode ON on the client (explorer 
uses only passive transfers, other FTP clients use normal FTP, but this can 
be changed).

In normal mode the server connects to the client for data transfers and 
most firewalls will block this on the client side. In passive mode the 
client connects to the server (the normal way in client/server applications).

See http://freedns.afraid.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2109 for more info.

Subject: [Xitami] XML format not implemented?
Message-ID: <598325d6e1df1587175625b83986a50a@verfaillie.com>

Hello !

When i try to deliver XML files, the brower get the message '501 - not implemented', even if i provide a mime content-type in default.cfg.
I had to use a custom extension to force Xitami to display the page.

Example, not working
http://afr_upd.verfaillie.be:20800/sitemap.xml

Example, working, using 'wrong' extension and content-type mapping
http://afr_upd.verfaillie.be:20800/sitemap.xmt



For those interested, i provide a webserver-test (to check that your server is responding to the internet):
http://afr_upd.verfaillie.be:20800/svt/svt.htm
Enter the domain name or ip of your server, the port number, eventually a resource file and select one of my servers.

This is probably because Xitami has, by default, a WSX filter defined for XML 
files, and this filter is failing for your specific XML files.  You can 
disable this by deleting the line ".xml=xixxml" in xitami.cfg.  It is in the 
[Wsx] section.

No, this is most likely web browsers or spiders disconnecting abruptly.

No.  That is the "default" welcome file that comes bundles with Xitami.   
Change it to whatever you'd like.  :-)

Subject: [Xitami] CGI issues
Message-ID: <BAY103-DAV34AF10B95DE3DCEA63A8FF8AB0@phx.gbl>

I am not certain if my problem is related to my script or to the Xitami CGI settings

##### script
I have written a perl script to upload files via the web.  In order to create a Progress Bar I am bypassing the CGI module in Perl and am process the raw STDIN directly and store it to a temporary file, after this code below I then use perl CGI.pm to parse the contents of that TMP file.  It all works fine however any file over 300k causes the server to return this error: "This server is currently overloaded - please try again later", here is my perl code that is getting the POST STDIN:

open (TMP,">$base_dir/postdata$sessionid") ;
while (read (STDIN ,$LINE, 2048) && $bRead < $len ) {
 $bRead += length $LINE;
 $size = -s "$base_dir/postdata$sessionid";

 # slow things down so that the user can actually see the progress bar.
 select(undef, undef, undef,0.35); # sleep for 0.2 of a second.

 $i++;
 print TMP $LINE;
}

##### Xitami CGI settings
Or is this an issue with my CGI settings in Xitami:
    Server Settings:
        Allow Keep-Alive-Connections?   CHECKED, allow up to 25 requests, close after 30 seconds
        Server performance: Normal
    CGI Settings:
        Timeout for CGI programs: 60 seconds
        Check CGI progress every: 200 msecs
        Support 16bit CGI: CHECKED
        Use standard I/O: CHECKED
        Full Environment: CHECKED
       

Anyone have any insights into why this would be occurring?  Is it script parameters or is it Xitami CGI settings?

Ok, I found my own problem but would still like some input.

The line in my perl script...
 # slow things down so that the user can actually see the progress bar.
 select(undef, undef, undef,0.35); # sleep for 0.2 of a second.

..choked the bandwidth for the upload (really choked it, down to about 30k per second) and allowed the /postdata$sessionid file to be created.  Another script in a popup window was monitoring the status of that TMP /postdata$sessionid file to create the actual Progress Bar.  I comment out the "select(undef....) line and my script now uploads at about 250k per second and doesn't error out.  However, with that line commented out /postdata$sessionid never gets created which means the popup window script can't ever create the Progress Bar.  

Any takers on this one?

Subject: [Xitami] hiding URL paths
Message-ID: <BAY103-DAV56F202A336A50BF219901F8AA0@phx.gbl>

I have a photo site that requires ppl to login to access, however if you type in the direct URL to the photos (photo directories) themselves you can still access them directly with a http://www.blah.com/photos/foo.jpg.  Is it possible to hide the real URLs from the world, or the paths from the world so they can't access the photos directly?  My goal is to force users to login to be able to access the photos, and only be able to access the photos the rights to?

Thanks,
Russel

Or is there a way to lock down the directories so they require user/pass to gain access, and then be able to pass that user/pass to the server via a script.  The user/pass would be hidden in the script and not passed via HTTP POST?

It looks as if the Aliases section might be what I am looking for, but can I pass it variables?

Virtual Path            Real Path
/photos/$var            /xitami/photos

and then $var would be translated to: /photos/user1/album1/foo.jpg.  But I supposed the web surferer could still type in http://www.blah.com/photos/user1/album1/foo.jpg and stil get to the photo.  I need some way of directing a virtual path to a real path, but be able to prevent the virtual path from accessed directly.  So this takes me back to my original question.

  Or is there a way to lock down the directories so they require user/pass to gain access, and then be able to pass that user/pass to the server via a script.  The user/pass would be hidden in the script and not passed via HTTP POST?

    Subject: [Xitami] hiding URL paths


    I have a photo site that requires ppl to login to access, however if you type in the direct URL to the photos (photo directories) themselves you can still access them directly with a http://www.blah.com/photos/foo.jpg.  Is it possible to hide the real URLs from the world, or the paths from the world so they can't access the photos directly?  My goal is to force users to login to be able to access the photos, and only be able to access the photos the rights to?

    Thanks,
    Russel

you don't /have/ to set the alias path to a subdir of the root path. 
i.e., having root at c:\web\ and the alias /photo/ at f:\photo\ is 
perfectly valid.

Yeah, I get that:

Virtual        Real
/foo/            C:\blahdir\
/foo/            C:\xitami\blahdir\
/foo/            D:\something\blahdir

But what I am looking for is a way to put photos in a directory that are
unaccessable from a direct URL path.  I am trying to prevent users who are
not logged in from getting to photos they don't have access to see.  If I
move them to an aliased directory, then users can simply type in the alias
path and still get to them.  If I move them non-aliased path or a non
webroot path, then the only way I know to serve the photos is to have Perl
serve up raw image data.  But that can take up alot of server CPU.  If the
files are in a non-aliases or non webroot path, then a simple <img
src=/photos/foo.jpg> won't work, the /photos/foo.jpg must be in a valid HTTP
path for the image tag to work.

In the xitami.aut file, indicate the directories to be protected, and for each 
section a list of 1..n user/password pairs

There are a couple of things you can do. If you have PHP and MySQL
installed then do it via php. You can download Coppermine or 4images and
which will do the trick. Also I know there are simple php scripts that
will do it for you and if you are interested I think I have one but I'll
have to dig it up. What I do for my Gallery sites is, I run Geeklog
www.geeklog.net and a 4images plugin. Geeklog also has it's own Gallery
plugin that works great. 

As far as doing it via Extami I'm not sure. I'm just giving you other
options.

Ron

Hi Folks:

There is a strange thing happening with my Xitami Server.  sometimes I can 
connect and other times I cannot.  When I stop and restart the service, it 
seems to work again.

Is there some configuration setting that I nead to change?

Thanks all over the place gnag.

Subject: [Xitami] Developer Issue: POST STDIN vs CGI read
Message-ID: <BAY103-DAV1140AFCE77AAFC94F1AC97F8AC0@phx.gbl>

I am running Xitami on W2k machine.  How does Xitami handle POST data?  I am trying to read in the raw POST data from a file upload form, and while reading in the raw data my script writes to a temp file the progress of that upload.  Every 8k of POST data the temp file gets updated.  In the script the temp file gets created before the POST STDIN occurs. However, with Xitami the temp file doesn't get created until AFTER the entire raw STDIN has been processed, thus preventing the use of any status or progess data.  

Is Xitami server somehow holding onto the raw POST data, waiting for it to be completely read in, before handing it off to the CGI compiler or before handing it off to the perl script?  This same script works on Linux/apache the way its intended to, but on Windows/Xitami the temp file doesn't get written til after the raw data is completely read in.

This is a serious issue because it is inteferring with the ability to create a Progress Bar that shows users the status of a multi-file upload.  With Perl, the only way to create a Progress Bar is to write updates to a temp file (bytesIN of totalBytes) while the files are being uploaded, and a popup window refreshes itself and processes the contents of that temp file to be able to provide the visual progress of the file upload.  If Xitami is somehow interferring with the raw read of POST data, then there is no effective way of creating that temp file.

I tested Windows Apache (port 8080) and Windows Xitami (port 80), running identical upload scripts.  The upload form passes all the raw POST data to upload.pl and an onSubmit calls a popup window running progress.pl.  The upload.pl reads in all the raw POST data through a standard "while (<STDIN>)", during the while the script writes "bytesReadIn of totalBytes" to a temp file, every 8K of read in raw data the script flushes the buffer to the temp file to ensure its being written to properly.  While this the data is being read in and the temp file is being written to, the progress.pl script refreshes in the popup window every two seconds.  During each refresh it reads the last "bytesReadIn of totalBytes" entry in the temp file to create a visual progress bar, bytes counter and time elapsed.

In Apache, this whole process works because the temp file gets created and is written to on every 8K buffer flush, thus allowing the Progress Bar to increment properly in the popup window.  In Xitami, the temp file creation and/or the flush is being ignored and the temp file doesn't get created until the entire STDIN done being read in, thus the progress bar popup window remains empty during the entire upload until suddenly it shows 100% completed.  This is a very fundamental difference and issue in the way the Xitami CGI engine captures the POST data and passes it a parsing script. 

Can anyone elaborate on this?  This is a very critical issue for me.  I have created a photo upload site and am highly worried that without a status/progress bar users will think their browser has hung or the server has timed out. Big uploads of 5Mb to 15Mb could take 5 to 8 minutes, if users don't see a visual progress meter incrementing they will cancel the upload.  

Is there some setting or switch I am not aware of that can correct this problem?  If not, I may have to consider moving to Apache and I have no desire of doing that.  I have been a devoted Xitami user for nearly 7 years now and have no desire to stop being a Xitami user.

I do not believe there is anyway to get Xitami to handle posts in any
other way than a single chunk of everything

Subject: [Xitami] Version Xitami 2.5c2 works with PHP,
	but can't get Xitami Pro version 2.4c3 to work with PHP
Message-ID: <20050829164526.45378.qmail@web52904.mail.yahoo.com>

I'm new to this list, so please forgive me if this
question has been answered before.

We've been using the free version of Xitami (2.5c2) on
our intranet for some time. I had no difficulty
configuring PHP to work with it. We've decided that
we'd like to purchase the Xitami Pro version to use
SSL and restrict access with certificates, but I can't
get Xitami Pro version 2.4c3 to work with PHP.

Is this a problem with v2.4c3? Is there a different
way to configure PHP to work with v2.4c3 than the way
with the free version, 2.5c2?

As soon as I can test Xitami Pro in our office, we
will purchase the latest version.

Quite possibly the "free" version of Xitami/Pro that you are testing
is so old that it won't work with PHP in the same way.  You don't
explain what is not working, but Xitami/Pro is functionally identical
to Xitami except for the SSL layer (which affects things like virtual
hosting, but not PHP).

Can anyone else elaborate on this?  Is the CGI handler documented anywhere?  
Does it work differetly between Linux Xitami and Windows Xitami?  Does 
Xitami Pro handle it differently than Standard Xitami?  I am running Xitami 
v 2.4d9 - does the latest version handle this issue differently?

I would hope someone from iMaxtix can take the time to answer this.

In the xitami.aut file, indicate the directories to be protected, and for each 
section a list of 1..n user/password pairs

I think I might need to clarify, my users login through a web page and 
cookies are assigned to track their login, this is not a Xitami type login 
with the windows style popup window.  Is it still possible to use the Xitami 
htaccess file using cookies, or at least a way to adapt it?  And please 
clarify what you mean by placing an htaccess within the photos directory, I 
am not familiar with this technique.
