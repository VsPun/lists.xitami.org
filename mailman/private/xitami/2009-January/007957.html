<PRE>Since we have been using Xitami back in the os/2 days, we have had very
few problems reported, but for this particular customer, on his network,
it happens very frequently. I had another one go down right after I
wrote my last email. It happened right when I tried to access it. While
these systems do see quite a bit of network activity since video files
are being transferred to them overnight, the one that just crashed had
no other activity going on at the time.

Good question.  We could not reproduce these crashes either.  But they
were reported by various people, so they are real.  Could be random
timing, or the code trying to access unallocated memory that is 'ok'
most times, and garbage just now and then.

There are always lots of reasons why bugs don't happen systematically,
unfortunately the only way to solve them is to understand why they _do_
happen, which can be pretty hard.
