<PRE>Hi,

We have used Xitami as an embedded webserver in conjunction with our
LRWP application for many years. One customer has 90 or so sites.  This
morning, on approximately 30 of those Xitami was found locked up.  In
some cases restarting Xitami would fix it, but in some cases the
computers were just rebooted. Attached is an entry from the Windows
event log. I know that if a program does not provide a dll to get the
message from, it won't display a specific message in the event log, but
just thought I'd throw this out to see if anyone has any ideas. This is
the customer for which we found that leaving the Xitami control panel
open helped keep it from locking up. Why, I have no idea. I only noticed
that when the server was locked up and a browser was waiting on it, when
the control panel was opened, it completed the request. Now I'm told by
the customer that keeping the control applet open helps keep it running
for a few days but not indefinitely.  Also, we found abnormally large
memtrace.txt files on the systems that crashed, so we got the source,
built it and deployed that version. 

Has anyone seen Xitami lock ups like this?

Brian
