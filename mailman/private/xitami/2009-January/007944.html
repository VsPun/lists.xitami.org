<PRE>A fellow I know from another discussion group is currently having Xitami
troubles, along with troubles getting himself subscribed to this list to ask
questions.  Until he's able to get his list-subscription sorted out, and
able to post here himself, I've offered to post a message for him, in an
effort to help get his specific problem resolved as quickly as possible.

Hello,

I've been running Xitami (trouble free) for the past six or seven
years (as a service), on a WinXP-Pro (32-bit) machine. However,
concerned about my aging hardware, I recently migrated Xitami to a
newly purchased (remarketed) machine... where I've replicated the
original software environment as closely as possible.

   IBM Type 9210-KUA
   Pentium 4 3.2Ghz HyperThread
   2.0gb DDR2 ram
   500gb Sata hardrive
   WinXP-Pro SP2 (fully patched, WITHOUT IE-7)

   Xitami v2.5c2 (as a service)

This new machine appeared to run flawlessly for the first five days,
at which point it began to hang... in a rather non-responsive kind of
way.

What appears to be a crashed or dead Xitami does not get logged as
such... and Windows continues to report that the service is still
running.  If I attempt to stop the service, that hangs too... and
requires the use of the task-manager to actually take it down.

At that point however, if I attempt to restart the Xitami service, I
get the following error:

   Internet Explorer Script Error
       An Error has occurred in the script on this page.
   Line:    1
   Char:    1
   Error:    Unspecified error
   URL:    <A HREF="res://C:\WINDOWS\System32\mmcndmgr.dll/views.htm">res://C:\WINDOWS\System32\mmcndmgr.dll/views.htm</A>

Does anyone know how to make this stop?

Thanks  :)

Ed
