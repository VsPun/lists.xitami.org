<PRE>My response to all of this is a bit off topic but I thought it would be a good time to chime in because indirectly, in a way it is not...
BTW Magnus you for sure have a neat looking site-Bravo, it just takes so long to load on my end. I do have a question if anyone could pls help me on my new project? I have little to offer technically but I run several websites using an older X-serv version, I think it is prior to when the install made all the subdirs like &quot;app&quot; and so on....
I use a service from ip-address.com to track the location of incomings, this helps in keeping up with the ISS firewall logs used in conjunction with Xitami logs so as attacks are located both distance wise from my IP and the physical location-as well as the types of incoming bombs which pose the threats. Often the server gets &quot;poisoned&quot; by local DNS and there are ways to totally take over your connection. I won't go into to all of that now, that would be a dissertation.
What I would like to know is: can I run X-server from within my website directory? The reason for this is that I thought it might be easier to manage incoming connections by placcing all the xitami sub domain and virtual domain folders in the &quot;private&quot; directory so that any virtual home requests would be challenged for an ID and PW which I would give out. For example, I can find almost anyones email addr freind or foe to my web (even though they may or not be suspect of having malicous intent). I can gather this info from their IP address assuming it was not masked. Once I have their email addr I can find out their true identity, that is, only if the account was not an alias or anon. as so many are today. But regardless, this still helps me profile my visitors (am I allowed to say that...har har:)  Once a profile is made then I can invite visitors (theoretically) to sign up, assign an ID/PW, and since they would be returning through another virtual address, ie through the private directory by invitation, they would be identified and monitored with good standing, eliminating the need for tracebacks. This may be a pain for most folks on both ends but I would like to create a following that way but without charging $ for membership. Any ideas?  ie on how to make the private directory the gateway for all the virtual domains? tis Jon - a ten year XserverUsr with no technical knowhow whatsoever - Happy New Year all.
