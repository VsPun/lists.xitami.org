OS/2 at the time when Microsoft had their dirty fingers in it might have
had such a limitation; since BillyG threw his toys out of the pram, and
IBM continued alone with OS/2 v2 (and later Warp v3 and v4, and nowadays
v4.52; not to mention eComStation) there's been nothing like any such
limitation in OS/2.  I have seen people speak of running THOUSANDS of
threads, in many hundreds of processes, without any problems, in OS/2.

There again, if such a limitation existed in early OS/2 code (when M$
were still on-board), it may well have been carried through into WinNT
and Win2K.

Which is the only OS that supports SMP with up to 64 processors on the
x86 family?  It's not Linux; neither is it Windoze.

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
