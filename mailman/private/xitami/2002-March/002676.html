<PRE>&gt;<i> Can I run www.four-banger.net and www.mrhymbaugh.com from the same
</I>&gt;<i> computer with xitami?  These are two completely different sites.
</I>&gt;<i> Right now they are both going to the same site.
</I>
Register both names with your DNS, to the same machine. I think you
already have that working.

In Xitami's web-administration screen, click &quot;V-Host Wizard&quot;. Click
&quot;New&quot;.

Make up a name for the config file. Leave IP address blank; put
&quot;www.mrhymbaugh.com&quot; in &quot;...DNS host name:&quot;.

&quot;Web page root directory:&quot; is the folder where this site's home page
is.

While the docs suggest that a relative path can work, I've had best
luck using an absolute path like &quot;d:/wwwroot/Imlc&quot;. Use the forward
slashes, this isn't DOS. If you were on unix, you'd use the exact
letter-case.

For starters, you can ignore all else. Save Save Save until you
get back to the top Admin screen.

Now, stop Xitami completely, freshen your coffee, and restart it.
That isn't supposed to be necessary; X should note the modified
config file and re-read it within a minute. But some of us feel that
it is sometimes reluctant to do so. Killing it and cold-starting it
forces it to get the new configuration.

Also, whack your browser. Explorer in particular (but also NS) hates
to re-read a page if it thinks it &quot;hasn't changed&quot;. It can't
understand that the URL is no longer supposed to go to the same
file. Leaning on Ctrl-F5 will sometimes make it go to all the
trouble of actually getting the page.

Do the same for your four-banger. It can point to your main HTML
folder, or a sub-folder.

If a request comes to your machine and does not match any of the
V-Hosts you have defined, they will get Xitami's default page,
probably your Pub Crawl page. That would happen if the page were
requested by IP number instead of name (though that is very unlikely
for your dynamic IP), or super-old browsers that do not say (in the
HTTP header) where they think they are going. So be sure that page
gives them what you want, or at least nothing too dumb.
