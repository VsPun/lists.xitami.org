<PRE>All,

OK, I don't know where to begin with this one. I have a web page at
<A HREF="http://lllama.dynhost.com/.">http://lllama.dynhost.com/.</A> I have Xitami v2.5b5 on Win98. It looks fine
when viewed with Netscape (any version) and IE (any version) on my PC and
Mac.

I recently started using Opera 6.01. (Boy, is it great, but that's another
story.) When I view my home page in Opera, there is a problem. The page
usually (90% of the time) stalls when downloading, and only some of the
graphics appear. Some of the graphics display wrong - one graphic file
appears where another should. Hitting Refresh in the browser doesn't improve
things.

I assumed that my HTML was wrong, so I copied the files to my local drive
(in preparation to edit them), and to my surprise, Opera works fine with the
web page/graphics then. So THEN I turned off Xitami and ran SimpleServer,
and then Apache, and guess what: Opera sees the page just fine when I use
these other servers.

So, does ANYONE here know what is going on, and how to fix it?
