What would it take to get Imatix to find the time? I assume that money 
would be required to attract someone's attention.

So on that note perhaps you should give us some hints about the answers 
to questions like How much? for how long? and to produce what? I'm 
thinking that if you told the community the price then those of us with 
money and a list of bugs/features might be willing to stump up. If you 
don't tell us you are highly unlikely to get any response.

Also on a somewhat related note: if I were to develop and sell a setup 
that included xitami web server would you like a cut of the money and 
would you then be willing to provide me or my customers with support?
