</I>For those people that care. This is related to Keep-alives and is a 
xitami / Mozilla specific problem I added the following comment to the 
bug above

More infornmation.

1) I installed an Apache server to check. Apache 1.3.23 does not 
apparently have the same problem. Thus bug does not occur with
Xitami server + IE (5.5) client,
Apache server + IE (5.5) client,
Apache server + Mozilla client

only with Xitami server + Mozilla client,
 
Implication: Something is being handled incorrectly be either Xitami or 
Mozilla (under win2k as this works for win 98/ME)

2) I have occasionally seen the same behaviour on remote Xitami servers. 
But too infrequently to troubleshoot. This led me to think about what 
might be wrong and I looked at the Mozilla Debug preferences. By 
Disabling the keep alive feature in the networking section the problem 
is resolved

i.e. a prefs setting of user_pref(&quot;network.http.keep-alive&quot;, false);

Note that the related setting user_pref(&quot;network.http.pipelining&quot;, may 
be set to either true or false with no effect. it all depends on the 
keep-alive preference.

3) There is an equivalent setting in Xitami to diable keep-alives. 
Changing this has no effect. The only working solution is to change the 
preference setting in Mozilla

Summary
The combination of Win 2000 + Xitami + Mozilla (with keep-alive enabled) 
causes the bug. Change ANY of these and the bug goes away. This bug has 
occured in all versions of Mozilla from 0.9.6 up to and including the 
latest 0.9.9
