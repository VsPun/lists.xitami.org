<PRE>Hi Magnus - Hi Jeff - Hi Go Bonkers

  If you're using IE and proxy server configs might try checking the
  &quot;bypass proxy server for local addresses&quot; under connections.

When I'm doing all these changes and testing them I am entirely
off-line. There is no LAN connection. The phone jack is pulled out and
we don't have aol. 

Would I still need to try the connections/&quot;bypass proxy server for local
addresses&quot; and where is it located please?

You reminded me of also trying a Netscape request. I'll do that.

I uninstalled Norton Internet Security to do a reinstall for the
firewall allow problem. I tried all virtual subdomain host tests again,
with it uninstalled. Nothing. 

On my computer at work C:\I386\HOSTS does not exist but I'll see on my
laptop. I think no one would have bothered to delete it.

I think I am heading towards an XP reinstall. I hope I can manage it.

Thanks again for all this help.

Ayhan

Subdomain under Win XP Home localhost...
I just experimented with xp home and hosts entry's and xitami virtual 
servers/folders . .. kathy.local.lan   bob.local.lan    go to their own 
named folders fine once I from the console do the vhosts Wizard and then

follow it up with the domain names in Configurations/vHosts.

If you're using a proxy server, and/or if aol or your isp uses proxy 
servers, the hosts file in xp is probably  doing nothing.     Seems
theres 
also some spyware/adware &amp; blockers that also that can trick you into an

unknown proxy situation in xp rendering what you see in the etc/HOSTS
file 
ineffective.

If you're using IE and proxy server configs might try checking the
&quot;bypass 
proxy server for local addresses&quot; under connections.
