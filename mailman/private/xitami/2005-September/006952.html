Rick, could you recap the problem again.  I deleted the emails concerning 
this and am not able to recover them.  I am a network engineer so I should 
be able to assist in some capacity.  Please describe your LAN setup, your 
gateway equipement and configuration and your connection to your ISP.  Also 
include any pertinent info concerning your wireless configurations, DHCP 
scope definitions, etc.

-R

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; connection, which has been constantly releasing, and refreshing with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; new ip, several times a day (or hour).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sounds like an ISP problem to me, but could also be a broken router.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you sure all PPPoE fields are correct in the router (service name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the like)? Tried a different router for a day or so?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   the wireless router mentioned above, is actually a brand new replacement
</I>&gt;<i>for an older (linksys befsr41 ver.2 &quot;wired&quot;) router which was previously
</I>&gt;<i>assumed to be the cause of this issue. the new unit however, did not 
</I>&gt;<i>correct
</I>&gt;<i>the problem, and i'm now left holding 2 fully functional routers which both
</I>&gt;<i>produce the exact same results. i'm hoping i'll still be able to use the
</I>&gt;<i>older unit as a switch at some point, as i've already exceeded my 
</I>&gt;<i>time-frame
</I>&gt;<i>allowance for returning the new one. the only really good thing that came
</I>&gt;<i>out of the purchase, was an error made by the retailer... and as it turns
</I>&gt;<i>out, the new router only cost me about $35 canadian (after rebates). that,
</I>&gt;<i>in my opinion, was a very cheap price to pay for a brand-name wireless-g
</I>&gt;<i>upgrade.
</I>&gt;<i>  my decision to purchase a new router, came after replacing all my cables,
</I>&gt;<i>switching rooms, running all the usual security scans, rolling back 
</I>&gt;<i>software
</I>&gt;<i>versions, and 2 visits from an isp tech. replacing the router seemed to be
</I>&gt;<i>the last logical step at that point.
</I>&gt;<i>  the problem first began on the evening of july 26 while a scene from a 
</I>&gt;<i>new
</I>&gt;<i>tom selleck movie was being shot on my front lawn. interference from the
</I>&gt;<i>film crew's equipment, is what was first assumed by my isp to be the
</I>&gt;<i>problem... but it continued right through the entire month of august, long
</I>&gt;<i>after the crew had packed up and moved on.
</I>&gt;<i>  the problem did however, seem to stop immediately on september 1, right
</I>&gt;<i>after disabling the wireless function and updating all nic-card drivers
</I>&gt;<i>across the entire lan (a coincidence perhaps)... but decided to return
</I>&gt;<i>again, about 4 days ago. just like before, this problem is most likely to
</I>&gt;<i>get out of hand in the evenings, weekends, and late at night when the
</I>&gt;<i>offices at my isp are closed, and nobody's available to observe what's 
</I>&gt;<i>going
</I>&gt;<i>on. my requests for a replacement (isp provided) modem have gone ignored as
</I>&gt;<i>well, as they've already given a clean bill of health to the one i 
</I>&gt;<i>currently
</I>&gt;<i>have, twice (comtrend 9186).
</I>&gt;<i>  pppoe and &quot;keep alive&quot; settings on the router seem to all check out when
</I>&gt;<i>the isp's help desk walks me through. they are the same settings i've been
</I>&gt;<i>using for the past 4 years.
</I>&gt;<i>  i do apologise once again for bringing this into the &quot;xitami&quot; forum, but
</I>&gt;<i>from where i sit, i clearly see the relationship between the two... as my
</I>&gt;<i>server is unable to perform well as a result.
</I>&gt;<i>  thank you kindly for your comments magnus... should anything else on this
</I>&gt;<i>topic cross your mind, i'd be very pleased to hear from you. as the old 
</I>&gt;<i>geek
</I>&gt;<i>saying goes, &quot;i'm about ready to chuck this thing out the window&quot; :)
</I>&gt;<i>  rick
