<PRE>&gt;<i> I am somewhat new to using Xitami and I really need ot activate ASP to
</I>&gt;<i> work in my web pages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know, many will say, You're not running IIS, then why and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> Just trust me, I have 100,000 line sof code ready made and I want to
</I>&gt;<i> use what I have, not re-invent the wheel again. Just get my site up
</I>&gt;<i> and running.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SO, to make it simple...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I added the mime type in the default.cfg file to specify asp=text/html
</I>
Wrong way to do it. That will only serve up the ASP code as HTML as 
you discovered. You need to add a filter. Like:
[Filter]
    .asp=D:\\chilisoft\\asp.exe

But: Xitami can't run ASP. Only IIS and PWS can, natively, for others 
(xitami included) you need an ASP parser such as Chilisoft ASP (now 
obviously bought by Sun, don't know of alternatives, only that there 
are). You will have to run it in CGI mode, which is very slow. The 
beta version of Xitami has ISAPI support and may run some kind of 
ISAPI ASP parser (much, much faster), but the beta version is less 
stable and much buggier in my experience. Basically, Xitami is very 
ill-suited to doing ASP, or indeed any kind of server-side scripting 
requiring CGI parsing.

Plus, Xitami is unofficially dead. No long term solution. My advice 
would be to switch to something supported.
