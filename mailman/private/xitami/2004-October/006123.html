Hi, I've been using Xitami to run a few web sites on my XP machine for a =
long time now.  I've run into the occasional hiccup, but overall it's =
been pretty good.  I've got my computer set up on a local network with a =
router, and have all of the port forwarding, IP stuff set up properly, =
and haven't changed anything on the computer or the router.  Everything =
was working fine earlier tonight, but I noticed at one point the the =
xitami icon in the system tray is red.  When I open it and try to start =
the server, it will start for a few seconds and then terminate.  When =
left alone it will try to start itself but continue to fail and =
terminate.  I can access one of my sites still, oddly enough, but the =
rest will not open.  I can't log in to the adminstrator page to check =
the xitami settings manually.  I tried reinstalling from a fresh copy I =
downloaded, and I tried restoring from a backup I made on CD a few days =
ago.  Neither worked.  Of course I rebooted my system, and this did =
noting either.  Does anyone have an idea what the heck is going on =
here?!?!?  This has me really frustrated!

Thanks in advance,
Steve
