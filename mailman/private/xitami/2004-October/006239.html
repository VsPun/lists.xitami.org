In my experience, the single biggest source of hardware failures similar to
the one you've described has to do with pin connection types.  What I'm
referring to here is mixing metals and letting them oxidize in the
computer.  It may seem minor, but memory and motherboard manufacturers
publish lead types (gold vs. tin) for this very reason.  If you mix gold
contact memory with a tin contact motherboard, it will work fine for about
6-12 months before the occassional and very random blue-screen starts
showing up.  About 3-4 years down the road, the PC becomes almost unusable.
 Basically, this is your typical nasty chemical reaction that requires you
to replace both motherboard and memory chips to correct the problem.  Most
computer makers know about this and make sure built PCs match pin types -
unless they are trying to get you to have problems and become unhappy with
them.

Of course, bad memory modules can cause the problem you are having as well
(but you would have been noticing things from day one of owning the PC).
If you have two sticks, try pulling one and see if that improves the
situation.  If not, substitute the pulled one with the other.  If someone
has the same RAM type as you and their system works (and they are willing
to let you borrow their RAM), try that before spending a chunk of money on
good RAM.
