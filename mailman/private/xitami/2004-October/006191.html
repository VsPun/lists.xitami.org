<PRE>Hi:

Sorry if I repeat this again but i found that in the docs says:


********************************
Building Multilanguage Web Sites

Xitami accepts the HTTP Accept-Language field and tries to do something 
useful with it. Not all browsers let you set this field, but some do. 
This field lets users specify their preferences for particular versions 
of documents. For instance, if a user specifies that they prefer 
documents in French, then English, the Accept-Language field will 
contain &quot;fr, en&quot;. Xitami handles this as follows, for a document URL &quot;
file.htm&quot;:

    * If the file &quot;file.htm&quot; exists and is readable, Xitami returns it 
to the browser as usual.
    * If the file does not exist, Xitami will search for &quot;file.html&quot;, &quot;
file.htm.fr&quot;, &quot;file.htm_fr&quot;, &quot;file.html.fr&quot;, &quot;file.html_fr&quot;, &quot;file.htm.
en&quot;, &quot;file.htm_en&quot;, &quot;file.html.en&quot;, and &quot;file.html_en&quot; in that order.
    * If the file is still not found, Xitami returns a 404 error status.
 

The same applies to default pages and to CGI scripts, and filters. Note 
that Xitami will only do the extra checking for alternative htm/html 
files for .htm and .html files. 
********************************


But don't say if is possible to configure it, so, can't be possible 
what i said in my first post?



MY FIRST POST WAS THIS:
=========
Hi:

I'm new to the list. I checked some months back if the answer is 
somewhere but ... a lot of months and only I have a life :/

Well as the subject says it's about htm and html files: Is there a way 
to make xitami treat them different?

Here in example:
I have a site with a file named xxx.html.
I have another file with a link to xxx.htm (no html).
I click the link in this file that points xxx.htm.

Why Xitami route you to the xxx.html file intead the xxx.htm? That no 
exists so it would display a 404 error... but no, it doesn't, it routes 
you to the other file.

And now, testing... I don't know why, with some .htm promts you to save 
them instead route you .html or 404 error. I changed mime, but i 
restored again...

So, any help?

Thanks.
=========
