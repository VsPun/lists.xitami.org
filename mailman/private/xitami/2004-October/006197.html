<PRE>Maybe there's a way to run IIS internally without letting open ports to the
internet (e.g. running in another machine in the LAN or closing IIS port to
the world via firewall rules), then making xitami asking pages to iis
trasparently (via some proxying script, or cgi, or lrwp, or anything else)
then simply copying the response to the client. This way you surely have to
have both servers to run, but it could be a good way to migrate to anything
better than ASP, starting using what you just have (3 years of works as I
understand), then translating a little bit at a time in the new language (if
you want to migrate).

But if you don't want to migrate I think the solution is to get locked to
IIS... ASP is born for IIS and viceversa... so why using two tools that
speak different languages (xitami and asp), that will only put some other
software that in the best will slow down your site, in the worst will mess
your life up with security and complexity.

(As you can understand I'm not a real fan of Microsoft, but I think that
everyone has it's own necessities... so if you [ want|need|be forced to ]
use microsoft stuff, well... use it ;-)))
