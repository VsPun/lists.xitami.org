<PRE>I use a lot of PHP, some Perl, and Javascript. Since a version of IIS, which
includes ASP comes with Windows 2000 Pro and Microsoft allows you to install
it and other other programs then I find it hard to believe that they would
let you use everything else as long as it's not ASP. They have been through
all those lawsuits before. Personally I would rather use PHP, I like it and
prefer it. I just figured adding one more feature to the ole toolbelt would
be good. As it sits I can do everything with Xitami that I want to do except
ASP. Where as some of the other products can do everything including ASP.
Don't get me wrong I'm not about to give my my Xitami for one of these other
products. It's just a great many of your high level web designers are using
ASP and getting Xitami to do ASP I think would then blow the competition out
of the water.

Just my opinion.

I don't agree.

There are solutions out there that are just as good, if not better than ASP.

Perl, PHP, Python, REXX just to name a few. All are free, all come with
excellent support. They are all also cross-platform compatible. ASP is
not, it is a solution from a single vendor for a single platform.

Xitami is ran on many more platforms than just Windows. If we are going
to discuss solutions that we want to apply to all, then let ASP die.

I would highly suspect that using ASP.DLL in conjunction with any other
product besides IIS violates the licensing agreement that Microsoft
implicitly makes you agree to when you install IIS.
