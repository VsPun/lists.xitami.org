Ok guys... one step closer to the sorting out all of the nasty bits, odds 
and ends. Many asked before me, I'm sure, if we can run ASP on Xitami 
without having to hassle through IIS and ASP.DLL and so forth. Everyone 
here surely knows that VBScript and VBS for Applications is the root to ASP 
3.0 Now, many also say, Yes we can if you pay this and that much for a 
parser. Well... we're one step closer to the FREE way of doing it. At least 
it seems to work on my Win 2000 Pro box with nothing but Windows Script 
Engine 5.6 freely available from MS web site. Download and install the 
Scipting engine, unless you already have it. ----------- Add the following 
to your MIME specifications in the DEFAULT.CFG file [Mime] # &gt;&gt; Added by 
MRJ Design Vbs=&quot;application/x-vbs&quot; Vbs=&quot;text/vbs&quot; Vbs=&quot;text/vbscript&quot; #

A Simple First Page

==================================================================== End 
adding here, and restart/reset your Xitami... Surf into your page 
<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/TEST.HTM">http://127.0.0.1/TEST.HTM</A> 
==================================================================== Now, 
if this doesn't look and feel like VB to you, then I don't know...

Add the following to your MIME specifications in the DEFAULT.CFG file

    Vbs=&quot;application/x-vbs&quot;
    Vbs=&quot;text/vbs&quot;
    Vbs=&quot;text/vbscript&quot;
# &lt;&lt; Added by MRJ Design
# If you want to make it appear as if ASP is being enabled on your domain, you could
# also add a line saying
    Asp=&quot;text/html&quot;
#It's cheating but looks kinda cool.



====================================================================
Now create a file named TEST.HTM and add the following lines.........................................
====================================================================

&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;A Simple First Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=&quot;VBScript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--

Sub ConvertTemp()
   temp = InputBox(&quot;Please enter the temperature in degrees F.&quot;, 1)
   MsgBox &quot;The temperature is &quot; &amp; Celsius(temp) &amp; &quot; degrees C.&quot;
End Sub

Function Celsius(fDegrees)
   Celsius = (fDegrees - 32) * 5 / 9
End Function

Sub Button1_OnClick
   MsgBox &quot;Mirabile visu.&quot;
End Sub

Call ConvertTemp
--&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;


&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H3&gt;A Simple First Page&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;FORM&gt;&lt;INPUT NAME=&quot;Button1&quot; TYPE=&quot;BUTTON&quot; VALUE=&quot;Click Here&quot;&gt;&lt;/FORM&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

====================================================================
End adding here, and restart/reset your Xitami...
Surf into your page <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/TEST.HTM">http://127.0.0.1/TEST.HTM</A>
====================================================================

Now, if this doesn't look and feel like VB to you, then I don't know...
