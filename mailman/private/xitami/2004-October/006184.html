thank you jacob
for taking the time to reply
 
while viewing the router's incoming log-table, i can clearly see inbound traffic reaching xitami on port-80 as expected.  while viewing the router's outgoing log-table however, it appears that xitami makes use of a very wide range of random outgoing ports, while transmitting it's response to corresponding ip-addresses.
 
since installing some proper router-log capture and viewing software, it's now very clear to see that i was confusing xitami's http-transmission port, with the outgoing service-ports which are logged by the router.  though i did not believe you at first jacob, the new software clearly indicates that xitami is indeed transmitting on port-80 like you said it was.
 
i now have a second question which does not pertain to xitami, but i feel that someone in this forum should be able to assist:
 
this router-logging software (obtained from the router manufacturer) is very basic, and offers very little flexibility for tweaking user-options and comfort settings.  it simply loads at start-up, maximized in a 'normal window', and begins capturing log-data from the router.  closing the window [x], minimizes this tiny utility to the system-tray... where it belongs.
 
i would like to edit the run-key to have this utility load hidden, and directly to the system-tray, but cannot seem to find the correct command-suffix for the task.  i would kindly appreciate any information which may assist me with editing this run-key correctly.  thank you.

Xitami will only use the port its listning on to transmit
on, what you might see is ftp transferes though, as they
use random port, http on the other hand uses only port 80
unless you have configured it for another port.
