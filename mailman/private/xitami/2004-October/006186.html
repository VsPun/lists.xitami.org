<PRE>I have to agree somewhat, this is not ASP running. However it did give me an
idea. What I tried to do was install IIS on my win2k pro PC running Xitami
except put IIS on a different port. That way it would install ASP.dll. (I
don't know any other way to get ASP.dll installed) Once I have this up and
running on Personal Web Server (IIS) on say port 8181, then I would need to
try to get Xitami to recognize it. I have also found other versions of ASP.
One is Chili something or other from Sun, iASP. If you have an idea on how
Xitami could us the ASP.dll let me know.

Reason I would like this to work is because there are a lot of people
wanting to use ASP. And this could open up a lot more doors.

Of course it doesn't: that's because what MRJ have put out is a simple
HTML page (in their Test) that happens to contain &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags
specifying the use of VBScript language --- on the CLIENT machine.

The whole concept of ASP is that the embedded VBScript is executed on the
SERVER.

Keep such parochial languages to the server end alone; at least
Javascript/ECMAScript/JScript is universally supported by browsers at the
client end.

ASP on a server does nothing that other server-side scripting such as
Perl or REXX can achieve.  To persist in the search for a Holy Grail
merely reinforces Redmond's attempted monopolistic tendencies.

   &quot;I don't use Linux. I prefer to use an OS supported by a large multi-
   national vendor, with a good office suite, excellent network/internet
   software and decent hardware support.&quot;
