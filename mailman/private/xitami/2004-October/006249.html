</I>&gt;<i> &gt;If I'm not wrong this list is for asking and giving help about Xitami,
</I>not
&gt;<i> &gt;for commercials of other webservers or other stuff. We've understand that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Protonova is the best product of the galaxy, but we are using Xitami. If
</I>you
&gt;<i> &gt;can help to solve our Xitami related issues you are very welcome, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;_personally_ I'm tired of your way of helping. Nothing personal, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Dario B.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only problem is, I don't know where else it is acceptable to discuss
</I>&gt;<i> ProtoNova with users who might be considering another web server other
</I>than
&gt;<i> those lists that such users are subscribed to.  Put yourself in my shoes
</I>&gt;<i> and what would you be doing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course I could be going about this all the wrong way and you know of a
</I>&gt;<i> better method that I am obviously missing that draws me some more
</I>business.
&gt;<i>  It would be really helpful to give me some very specific places to go to
</I>&gt;<i> on the Internet where people _want_ to hear about such things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At any rate, all mentions of ProtoNova will disappear off this list.  I
</I>&gt;<i> might stick around to help with Xitami-related issues, but will remove the
</I>&gt;<i> ProtoNova &quot;ads&quot; from even my signature if and when I do.  As it is, I have
</I>&gt;<i> effectively figured out how to alienate myself from you and other people
</I>on
&gt;<i> this list and for that I'm sorry and regret what I've done.  I have
</I>learned
&gt;<i> a few things through this experience.  I hope you'll find it in you
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere to forgive the damage I caused.

I'd like you'll keep staying here, I follow this list since early 2003 and I
can say your help can be very useful for everyone.
I think you are not a newbie and you know what generally is permitted and
what not in a mailing list by the netiquette.
