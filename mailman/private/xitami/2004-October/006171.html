</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Normally Xitami reads the config file each 60 seconds (main config 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>screen) so i don't see the need for restarting the server, only activate 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>any change much faster.
</I>
Well here's another glitch then.
I tried first to run the xigui as a service by starting it with the RUNAS 
cmd line.
That worked fine.

What I noticed is I secured it a little bit to good and Xitami didn't even 
get permissions to work as a FTP server and hence, I could not update the 
files, only view the present contents.
It could be because I set all accounts except the main one to not have read 
or write permissions on the C drive :)

Secondly, I had to kill the process and start the GUI again to get it back. 
Not a problem so far.

I added one more domain and logged in through FTP about 3 hours later.
It wouldn't let me because the 60 second auto refresh of the config files 
didn't take.
So I had to terminate the GUI again and double click the icon to start it 
up once more.
That did it.

I'll try to find a work around for it but in the meantime a fix from the 
source side of it might be in place since it doesn't auto update every 60 
seconds.

Thanks for reading.
