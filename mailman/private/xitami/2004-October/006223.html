<PRE>Just to throw in two bits more for you to contemplate. I had an SE box for
an intranet app in an office once. Had some crash problems occasionally,
only needed a reboot to fix the problem, did not happen very often. The
cause seemed to be SE's inablity to release memory, so may need to research
ways to optimize the ram for the op system. And don't let them tell you that
SE is a bad os, just and older one, one that had a very good rep during it's
time.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recently, i don't know why either, i've been receiving hits to my

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; win98se sith blue screen. i am using xitami v 2.4d9 on win98se (don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; laugh).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ran the same combination for 4 years with no major problems. Never had a

&gt;<i> day on that system. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Look in the log folder C:\Xitami\Logs  You will find ac------.log &amp; an

&gt;<i> will tell you what is causing the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The log file should show if there were any dos requests.
</I>&gt;<i> The error file should tell you what happened at that time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, the win98se crash could have been caused by to many users at one time
</I>for
&gt;<i> your system to handle. I believe the default number of users for that
</I>version of
&gt;<i> Xitami is 10 &amp; that may be to many for your system. Try resetting
</I>defaults.cfg
&gt;<i> [Server]
</I>&gt;<i>     Limit = &quot;10&quot;  to 5 &amp; see if you still have problems
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i am wondering has anyone figured out a script that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reset xitami hits automatically, to counter the malicious hits coming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The number of hits doesn't make any difference. The problem is when there
</I>are to
&gt;<i> many people trying to get into your computer at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [p.s. - i have downloaded 2.5c2 from xitami.com but did not see the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install file. i'm so busy on other projects, i can't get it to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right now.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just unzip it to a new folder in C:\Xitami252 &amp; copy the existing website
</I>folder
&gt;<i> the new folder. When you are sure you have everything working you can
</I>remove the
&gt;<i> old version.
