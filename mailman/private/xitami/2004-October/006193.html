<PRE>Here's one solution to make this work in Xitami and ASP and this time I 
mean PURE ASP.
It has ONE drawback and that is you have to specify a port number in the URL.
=================================================================================
1) Install Xitami and all things as you like them set up.
Now go back to the installation disk for Windows 2K, 2k3 or selected flavor.

2) Install IIS 5 or 6 of your choice.

3) Enable ASP pages and set permissions to enable ASP to execute as needed.
Script permissions with read permissions.

4) Now set IIS to open on Port 79 and specify the home page directory to be 
your Xitami/webpages/ directory

5) Point ASP queries to Yourdomain.com:79/YourPage.asp and voila'... it 
works :)
=================================================================================
I'll keep tricking this thing until I get it to run without ASP... oh and

I dont personally believe there is something wrong with PERL, PHP or 
anything else,
  so I would appreciate the same courtesy in return regarding ASP.

Only because I don't use Linux, doesn't mean I will imply or propose to let 
Linux die.
I am sure it has it's purpose somewhere in the midst of things. It just 
doesn't solve my clients problems.




&gt;<i>I have to agree somewhat, this is not ASP running. However it did give me an
</I>&gt;<i>idea. What I tried to do was install IIS on my win2k pro PC running Xitami
</I>&gt;<i>except put IIS on a different port. That way it would install ASP.dll. (I
</I>&gt;<i>don't know any other way to get ASP.dll installed) Once I have this up and
</I>&gt;<i>running on Personal Web Server (IIS) on say port 8181, then I would need to
</I>&gt;<i>try to get Xitami to recognize it. I have also found other versions of ASP.
</I>&gt;<i>One is Chili something or other from Sun, iASP. If you have an idea on how
</I>&gt;<i>Xitami could us the ASP.dll let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Reason I would like this to work is because there are a lot of people
</I>&gt;<i>wanting to use ASP. And this could open up a lot more doors.
