<PRE>I run my own DNS server on the same machine which resolves different domains
to different IP addresses. A good easy to use DNS server is DNS Plus and if
you are on a dynamic IP you can use DNS2GO.com or 2myDNS.com. So as my ISP
changes my IP, daily I might add, DNS2GO and 2MYDSN update their DNS Server
for my new IP Address. So if someone enters www.mydomain.com, or
www.myotherdomain.com or 123.mydomain.com. it will naturally go to the IP
address of my computer. Now what does my computer do with it. That's where
DNS Plus takes that domain name and resolves it to an internal IP which
Windows 2000 Pro can have hundreds of virtial IPs. So it goes like this.

Enter www.mydomain.com &gt; 2MYDNS.com says go to my PC at 200.111.222.111 &gt;
DNSPlus gets it and says go to 192.168.1.12 &gt; which my Xitami default.cfg
says this 192.168.1.12 = &quot;mydomain.cfg&quot; and thus viola the www.mydomain.com
index.html page displays.

If someone enters 123.mydomain.com then DNSPlus may send it to 192.168.1.13
which the Xitami default.cfg says 192.168.1.13 = &quot;123mydomain.cfg&quot;

I know there are other ways to do this but this works well for me. I can
host many VHosts.

You're forgetting that domain names are for people, computers look for IP
addresses.

&gt;<i> Now by default all hits on www.mydomain.com, mydomain.com and
</I>&gt;<i> anything.mydomain.com will hit the base host.

Because the name's resolves to the same IPaddress of the server.

&gt;<i> I also run several VHosted domains with different domain names.
</I>
Different names at the same address get put in the same mail box.

&gt;<i> I specify a cfg and aut file for a VHost path to a different directory now

</I>&gt;<i> I want to set other.mydomain.com to go in this directory only and not to

mydomain.com/other will send to other folder.

&gt;<i> I have also specified it under the Virtual Hosts section in the

You would need different IP addresses for each of the 'other' vhost folders
to
be considered different places.

Xitami is small enough you could run a different site each with it's own
VHost
name on different ports.
IE:
Register ipaddress:80 for main, ipadress:8080 for vhost1 &amp; using different
ports
for each vhost site.

Or just do like the big guys (&amp; the rest of us) do &amp; put each site at
maindomain/~vhost for each different site. Which is a lot easier.

Alex,
