<PRE>XP has the same problem on memory releases as 9X does and so does Win 2000.

You will see after running XP for a longer period of time that the OS may 
be using 250 Mb memory on a large machine.
Also, it will NOT help to add more RAM as the memory specifications are 
more or less false as provided from M$

98 Should run best with up to 256 Mb RAM, try 128 and it's smoother
WIn 2000 specifies 1 Gb max but will not run properly or fast enough unless 
you use 512 Mb max.

Windows XP specifies a max limit of 4 Gb but actually runs faster on 2 Gb. 
Even so you could pull it down to 1 Gb and get a stable result because most 
processes will never even touch the upper or second chip.

Will be fun to see how they resolve this in Longhorn which will require 100 
GB hdd and 1 Gb ram to even run, plus all other hardware has to be 
digitally signed for it to run. At least as they specified it for the 4074 
release.

I run Xitami on Win 2 K and serve about 800-1000 Mb per day at well over 
10-20 000 hits and it seems stable.
The only trouble was resetting the server to get it to refresh the cfg 
files. But that's resolved by a simple &amp; free remote VNC controller from my 
desktop.
In addition I run DNS, FTP, HTTP and Mail from the same box too.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; recently, i don't know why either, i've been receiving hits to my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; xitami server and it seems for the purpose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of crashing it. i mean these hits are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; coming in by the second. usually at hit 861, service will freeze
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; win98se sith blue screen. i am using xitami v 2.4d9 on win98se (don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; laugh).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ran the same combination for 4 years with no major problems. Never had a
</I>&gt;<i>blue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screen caused by Xitami even with many attacks. I often got thousands of
</I>&gt;<i>hits a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; day on that system. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Look in the log folder C:\Xitami\Logs  You will find ac------.log &amp; an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; er------.log.  ------ being the date. These files can be opened with
</I>&gt;<i>notepad &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will tell you what is causing the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The log file should show if there were any dos requests.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The error file should tell you what happened at that time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMO, the win98se crash could have been caused by to many users at one time
</I>&gt;<i>for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your system to handle. I believe the default number of users for that
</I>&gt;<i>version of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Xitami is 10 &amp; that may be to many for your system. Try resetting
</I>&gt;<i>defaults.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [Server]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Limit = &quot;10&quot;  to 5 &amp; see if you still have problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; i am wondering has anyone figured out a script that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reset xitami hits automatically, to counter the malicious hits coming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; through?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The number of hits doesn't make any difference. The problem is when there
</I>&gt;<i>are to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many people trying to get into your computer at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; [p.s. - i have downloaded 2.5c2 from xitami.com but did not see the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; install file. i'm so busy on other projects, i can't get it to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; right now.]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just unzip it to a new folder in C:\Xitami252 &amp; copy the existing website
</I>&gt;<i>folder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the new folder. When you are sure you have everything working you can
</I>&gt;<i>remove the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; old version.
