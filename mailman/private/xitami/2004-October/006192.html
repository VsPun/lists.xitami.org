<PRE>Of course it's not ASP.
It's VBS... then again as Ron is saying here, this is the idea I got too 
but I have not found a way to get the ASP.DLL to react to it yet.
I have the IIS running on port 79 for this purpose and the Xitami on 80. 
Same Idea, lets hope we find the right approach for it.

And in response to the Holy Grail issue, it is simply a question about 
finding a way to reuse three years worth of work that is already integrated 
to many pages written in the past.
Why should I force many people to learn something new and limiting the 
ability of serving something that they would like to use.

Personally I am not to interested in paying for a conversion when I have 
IIS in the worst case scenario and I might as well run it straight out of 
the box.
The old ChilliSoft is some $500 dollars last I looked.

Lets hope one of us finds the solution and posts it in here.
