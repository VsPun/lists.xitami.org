<PRE>I get lockups almost daily, just sitting there running the webserver. I even
bought a auto rebooter for when it stops responding for 3 minutes it will
reboot the machine. I've wondered if it might be a hardware problem and I
think you answered that for me as YES! I suspect I may have a bad memory
module but had to rule out software TCP/IP and Xitami hits.

Ask a hardware guy and he will say it's a software problem, ask a software
guy and he will say it's a hardware problem. Who's corret???

I ran the same combination for 4 years with no major problems. Never had a
blue
screen caused by Xitami even with many attacks. I often got thousands of
hits a
day on that system. :)

Look in the log folder C:\Xitami\Logs  You will find ac------.log &amp; an
er------.log.  ------ being the date. These files can be opened with notepad
&amp;
will tell you what is causing the problem.

The log file should show if there were any dos requests.
The error file should tell you what happened at that time.

IMO, the win98se crash could have been caused by to many users at one time
for
your system to handle. I believe the default number of users for that
version of
Xitami is 10 &amp; that may be to many for your system. Try resetting
defaults.cfg
[Server]
    Limit = &quot;10&quot;  to 5 &amp; see if you still have problems

&gt;<i> i am wondering has anyone figured out a script that will
</I>&gt;<i> reset xitami hits automatically, to counter the malicious hits coming
</I>&gt;<i> through?
</I>
The number of hits doesn't make any difference. The problem is when there
are to
many people trying to get into your computer at the same time.

&gt;<i> [p.s. - i have downloaded 2.5c2 from xitami.com but did not see the
</I>&gt;<i> install file. i'm so busy on other projects, i can't get it to work
</I>&gt;<i> right now.]
</I>
Just unzip it to a new folder in C:\Xitami252 &amp; copy the existing website
folder
the new folder. When you are sure you have everything working you can remove
the
old version.

Alex,
