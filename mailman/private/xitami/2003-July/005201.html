<PRE>I'd do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP. If this fails, at least find out who
owns that IP block.
Compare that with the IP's used by Sitemeter, yourself, and any other
relevant IP addresses.

Do mean that the IP has always made a request, or that the IP has a port 80
connection that it sustains?
If it's simply that is shows up in you log every day, I would guess it to be
port scanner or trojan infected PC trying to find a way in to your server.
I get about 100 malicious requests a day on port 80 alone.

</I>&gt;<i>   Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I've got a problem (I think) and I'd sure like to hear from you guys as
</I>to
&gt;<i> what you think it is, and what to do about it!  I use one of the online
</I>&gt;<i> hit-counter, &quot;Sitemeter&quot;, that lets you check how many hits you have as
</I>well
&gt;<i> as where they come from and how long they stay.  Everytime I check it I&quot;ve
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that there is one particular ip address ALWAYS there!  At first I
</I>&gt;<i> just thought that this person enjoyed my site, lol, and spent a lot of
</I>time
&gt;<i> there, but now I'm getting a bit worried about it!  What could this be?
</I>Are
&gt;<i> they just linked to an image on my site, or are they spying or hacking me
</I>or
&gt;<i> what?  Also, how can I go about blocking that ip addy?  I have seen some
</I>of
&gt;<i> you talking about this in the past, and would really like to know what you
</I>&gt;<i> think this is, as well as what to do about it!  Thanks to all of you in
</I>&gt;<i> advance, and I hope you all are having a good day!  Happy upcoming 4th!
