<PRE>I'll have to disagree with Thomas in some respects. It all depends on what
you are doing with the site. For instance if you are running a forum or a
Blog, PHP to me is the way to go. Of course I went with PHP when I couldn't
do ASP on Xitami, at least not on the cheap. And some of my sites are just
plain html and perl while others are PHP. And my nephew works with Cold
Fusion on his website (on my server). My PHP sites are Blogs and plans are
for these sites to become much bigger. So when Thomas says PHP is good for a
small site I'm not real sure what he means. What is the definition of a
small site? One that gets very few hits or one with very few pages? Take a
look at www.inreview.com It is a forum site with possibly a thousand pages
and thousands of hits per day. Also CourtTV.com uses PHP at least for their
forum.

</I>
PHP is optimal for small sites that have no future growth expectations.  My
old PHP-based website:

<A HREF="http://www.shininglightpro.com/">http://www.shininglightpro.com/</A>

Has long been overdue to switch off of PHP to another scripting language.
That site is a beast to maintain and has thousands of lines of
compatibility code that I should never have had to write, but what really
crossed the line was that the latest versions of PHP kept breaking site
functionality (I have to keep an old version of PHP around just for that
site as &quot;upgrading&quot; would require re-writing thousands of lines of code).
PHP is optimal when nothing else is available (this is from a
professional/technical/business as well as my own personal standpoint).
Performance-wise, PHP compares well against most other scripting languages
(the ONLY thing going for it, IMHO), but this issue is being addressed in
the next few versions of Nuclear Vision and will put NVML on basically the
same performance level as most scripting languages.

Hope this helps!
