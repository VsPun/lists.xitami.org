&gt;<i>I'll have to disagree with Thomas in some respects. It all depends on what
</I>&gt;<i>you are doing with the site. For instance if you are running a forum or a
</I>&gt;<i>Blog, PHP to me is the way to go. Of course I went with PHP when I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i>do ASP on Xitami, at least not on the cheap. And some of my sites are just
</I>&gt;<i>plain html and perl while others are PHP. And my nephew works with Cold
</I>&gt;<i>Fusion on his website (on my server). My PHP sites are Blogs and plans are
</I>&gt;<i>for these sites to become much bigger. So when Thomas says PHP is good for a
</I>&gt;<i>small site I'm not real sure what he means. What is the definition of a
</I>&gt;<i>small site? One that gets very few hits or one with very few pages? Take a
</I>&gt;<i>look at www.inreview.com It is a forum site with possibly a thousand pages
</I>&gt;<i>and thousands of hits per day. Also CourtTV.com uses PHP at least for their
</I>&gt;<i>forum.
</I>
If that is all you need to run (Blogs and forums), most of those things are
generally written in PHP and pre-packaged that way.  However, if you need
to do anything else (e.g. I have a site that is _supposed_ to support
hundreds of software packages, but can't because of PHP's limitations), PHP
is not sufficient as a scripting language for me.  When I say small, I mean
content-wise small, not usage/#-of-visitors small.  However, I should point
out that any site running multiple languages requires all of the people
behind-the-scenes to know all of those languages...which costs more for the
company as those people tend to get paid more than people who only know one
or two languages.  Nuclear Vision is easier to learn and use, IMO, than
PHP.  It is designed as a freeware ColdFusion alternative and not
necessarily a PHP replacement.  Anyway, the OP decided to use PHP...I was
just merely providing an alternative.

Hope this helps!
