<PRE>  Hey Tom,

  Thank you for trying to help me with this!  I&quot;m not sure exactly how to 
best answer you, but I'll try and I hope that someone can please help me 
with it!  All I know is that this ip address: &quot;morrilton.net&quot; is ALWAYS 
showing to be on my site!  Hours and hours at a time, and if it leaves, it 
soon shows back up!  When I click on the site information links at site 
meter, it does show admin info and contact etc. but that don't help me any, 
as I'm not sure what to do with it!  Are you saying that I shoudl contact 
that isp admin and tell them that someone from their isp is always on my 
site, and ask them if they are hacking me?  Or could it be they are linked 
to an image on my site etc?  I'm more afraid that they may have taken over 
my computer as a &quot;host&quot; for hacking, or that they have actually hacked me or 
something like that!  I wish I knew more about this, but since I don't  I 
really appreciate any and all help and assistance I can get here!  Thanks a 
lot and have a good day!  I just need to know what they're doing there all 
the time, and what to do about it!  What would you do? Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i>I'd do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP. If this fails, at least find out who
</I>&gt;<i>owns that IP block.
</I>&gt;<i>Compare that with the IP's used by Sitemeter, yourself, and any other
</I>&gt;<i>relevant IP addresses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Do mean that the IP has always made a request, or that the IP has a port 80
</I>&gt;<i>connection that it sustains?
</I>&gt;<i>If it's simply that is shows up in you log every day, I would guess it to 
</I>&gt;<i>be
</I>&gt;<i>port scanner or trojan infected PC trying to find a way in to your server.
</I>&gt;<i>I get about 100 malicious requests a day on port 80 alone.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   I've got a problem (I think) and I'd sure like to hear from you guys 
</I>&gt;<i>as
</I>&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what you think it is, and what to do about it!  I use one of the online
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hit-counter, &quot;Sitemeter&quot;, that lets you check how many hits you have as
</I>&gt;<i>well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as where they come from and how long they stay.  Everytime I check it 
</I>&gt;<i>I&quot;ve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; noticed that there is one particular ip address ALWAYS there!  At first 
</I>&gt;<i>I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just thought that this person enjoyed my site, lol, and spent a lot of
</I>&gt;<i>time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there, but now I'm getting a bit worried about it!  What could this be?
</I>&gt;<i>Are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they just linked to an image on my site, or are they spying or hacking 
</I>&gt;<i>me
</I>&gt;<i>or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what?  Also, how can I go about blocking that ip addy?  I have seen some
</I>&gt;<i>of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you talking about this in the past, and would really like to know what 
</I>&gt;<i>you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think this is, as well as what to do about it!  Thanks to all of you in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advance, and I hope you all are having a good day!  Happy upcoming 4th!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
