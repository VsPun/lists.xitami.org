<PRE>&gt;<i> I have been using Xitami for damn nearly a decade now.  I have run it on 
</I>&gt;<i> all Windows platforms since Windows 95 and it has yet to fail me once.  
</I>
Same here, although I stopped running it a couple of years ago, because 
I needed better PHP performance on my (then) slow server (the time to 
start PHP as a CGI process is very noticeable) and could trade with the 
much bigger memory footprint of Apache. BUT before THAT, Xitami replaced 
my previous Netscape FastTrack webserver, which it completely trounced 
in every respect. And the Netscape servers were state of the art then 
back in the days.

&gt;<i> I hear what you're saying but I would just love to see Xitami get off 
</I>&gt;<i> the ground again.  It hasn't been changed or updated in how many years?  
</I>&gt;<i> 7? 8?  And it still kicks ass and serves all of my needs and is 
</I>&gt;<i> lightning fast - just imagine if it was even loosely maintained.
</I>
yeah, especially if it could be really stable with ISAPI (or the like) 
it would be a force to be reckoned with, still.
