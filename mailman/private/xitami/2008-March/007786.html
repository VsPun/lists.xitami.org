*sniff* don't be such a hater.  ;-)

I have been using Xitami for damn nearly a decade now.   I have run it on all Windows platforms since Windows 95 and it has yet to fail me once.  I hear what you're saying but I would just love to see Xitami get off the ground again.  It hasn't been changed or updated in how many years?  7? 8?  And it still kicks ass and serves all of my needs and is lightning fast - just imagine if it was even loosely maintained. 

Was just hoping there were some other sentimental blokes like myself who would want to make the effort.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I still vote for a Xitami to be picked up and development 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continued again.  Unfortunately, I am not a C programer - if I were I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have been contributing long ago.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that there are actively maintained alternatives out 
</I>&gt;<i> there. Apache is much more full featured, much less buggy, runs PHP as a 
</I>&gt;<i> module, and it's not even that slow anymore (although nowhere near 
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami for static content). And there is Lighttpd, which is a project 
</I>&gt;<i> with the same goals as originally Xitami, but still developed, with a 
</I>&gt;<i> broader userbase /and/ extreme performance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In all fairness, Xitami is better in some respects than both these 
</I>&gt;<i> products, especially regarding the built-in and quite usable web admin 
</I>&gt;<i> interface. But it has never been &quot;in style&quot;, and I don't see that 
</I>&gt;<i> happening without a couple of high-profile sites adopting it. Which 
</I>&gt;<i> won't happen, because it's not actively maintained. You see where this 
</I>&gt;<i> is going :-(
