<PRE>Show me some documentation that says you can have more than one port 80
listening then try running 2 instances of Xitami. I tried it and it didn't
work. 

Port 80 is set in the header of the TCP packet that's true. 

Here
<A HREF="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=tcp%2Fipport">http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=tcp%2Fipport</A>


It says &quot;A number assigned to user sessions and server applications in an IP
network.&quot; It doesn't say that each IP address has a port 80 only that is
uses port 80 to communicate with the server software. 

If you have documentation that states otherwise please show me.

&gt;<i> Ok let's analyze this a little. Your PC gets an IP address either static
</I>or
&gt;<i> dynamic. If you don't have a router then all traffic to that IP address
</I>&gt;<i> whether it is Http (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21) or eMail
</I>(port
&gt;<i> 25) ***if memory serves me on my ports*** is sent to your PC. (well even
</I>if
&gt;<i> you do have a router)
</I>
Oh boy, where to begin. Firstly, if you have a router, you must forward 
a port in said router to your computer, and /forward it to an IP 
address/. I'm sure you have done this. This should serve as an 
indication that ports are specified /per IP interface/; else, you could 
as well forward it to the adapter's MAC address.

&gt;<i>  You have one port 80, so any traffic is routed to that
</I>&gt;<i> port.
</I>
No, you &quot;have&quot; as many ports as you have IP adresses, including the 
several million addresses in the loopback range (127.x.x.x). In fact, 
you better learn that you don't actually &quot;have&quot; ports; don't think of it 
as a &quot;resource&quot;, rather, a way to address a specific software that has 
registered to be the recipient of traffic tagged that way.

&gt;<i>  Even if you set up many IP Addresses bound to that one NIC card you
</I>&gt;<i> still only have one Port
</I>
No, you &quot;have&quot; one port per IP address, including the several million IP 
addresses in the loopback range (which you don't have to specify).

&gt;<i>  which is why with one click of a button you can
</I>&gt;<i> shut down all web traffic with your firewall software. I have 28 virtual
</I>IP
&gt;<i> Address on my server however if I shut down port 80 all sites are shut
</I>down.

That is, of course, because your firewall works that way, and has 
nothing to do with how TCP/IP works.

&gt;<i> The only
</I>&gt;<i> way I could see more than one port 80 is by having more than one NIC card
</I>&gt;<i> and more than one PUBLIC IP Address. Multiple NIC cards Multiple Port
</I>80's. 

No, you could configure your web server to listen to a specific IP 
address. I don't know how to do that in Xitami (it's probably possible 
but I can't be bothered to look it up right now), but here's how to do 
it in Apache (including the comment):

**********begin quote**********
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses (0.0.0.0)
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 80
**********begin end**********

Now, the commented line &quot;Listen 12.34.56.78:80&quot; will bind the Apache 
process to a specific address. If you don't bind it to an address, 
however, and use the &quot;Listen 80&quot; line, then it will indeed listen to 
port 80 on all IP addresses bound to the computer, including the 
loopback range. But you have the option to run 28 separate processes 
listening to port 80 on your 28 IP addresses.

Nearly all server level software has the option to bind to a specific IP 
address.

&gt;<i> Now am I missing something?
</I>
Actually, without being too blunt, you should really read up on TCP/IP 
on the most basic level before posting more in this thread.
