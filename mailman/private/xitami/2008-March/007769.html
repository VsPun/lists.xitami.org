Yes, it did, but you didn't understand it. Important distinction. I 
actually quoted the relevant part, you still didn't understand it. 
Google &quot;TCP socket&quot;. Then read hit after hit until you understand.

&gt;<i> And I tried it on my server it just to see for myself and it didn't work.

Once again, I'm sure that's not the fault of the fundamentals of TCP/IP. 
Perhaps the fact that I got it to work in less than five minutes, after 
not running Xitami at all for maybe three years, should tell you 
something about our respective amounts of knowledge.

&gt;<i>  Tell me you have it
</I>&gt;<i> working and how you got it to work and I'll try it on my server and eat crow
</I>&gt;<i> if it does.

Download the zip. Unzip in two different directories. Edit the 
defaults.cfg so IP is different (for example, 127.0.0.1 and 127.0.0.2). 
Start the two servers. Does it work? If yes, great. If no, change LRWP 
and FTP port assignment to something different for each process. Start 
again. Now it works. Verify by editing the web pages.

It was very, very, very simple.
