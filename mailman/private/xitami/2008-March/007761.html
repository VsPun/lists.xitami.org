<PRE>Wikipedia was my first stop dude and then the over 100 pages after that and
I did not find one that said there was more than one port 80. And that Wiki
article surely didn't address more than one port 80. And I tried it on my
server it just to see for myself and it didn't work. Tell me you have it
working and how you got it to work and I'll try it on my server and eat crow
if it does.


WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS

The Well Known Ports are assigned by the IANA and on most systems can
only be used by system (or root) processes or by programs executed by
privileged users.

Ports are used in the TCP [RFC793] to name the ends of logical
connections which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of
providing services to unknown callers, a service contact port is
defined.  This list specifies the port used by the server process as
its contact port.  The contact port is sometimes called the
&quot;well-known port&quot;.

Lol, beautiful. &quot;Show me some documentation&quot;. Why not go out and try 
learning something? If you don't believe me OR the Xitami config file 
(!) OR the Apache config file /dealing with how to accomplish this very 
thing/, by all means live in ignorance. If you actually want to learn 
something, PLEASE begin with reading the very simple explanation at
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp_port">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp_port</A>
(which you yourself could have found googling for one second, or just 
trying to search the natural sources of information) and especially try 
to understand this sentence

&quot;Processes implement connections to TCP and UDP ports by means of 
sockets. A socket is a transport end-point, which a process can create 
and then bind to a socket address; in TCP or UDP, a socket address 
consists of a combination of a port and an IP address.&quot;

It can't be explained in a simpler way. If you don't understand that, 
please feel free to disregard everything I've said and believe anything 
that fits you, because then you're truly beyond help.

I'm all for learning people more about networking (even the most basic 
things), but when people start posting obnoxious and ignorant posts 
about something they should know if they actually had any business 
running servers on the net, I get pretty tired. This will be my last 
post on the subject, someone with (much) more patience and time could 
take over trying to explain the absolute basics of TCP/IP.

Oh, and by the way, you mention that you didn't manage to get Xitami 
working this way. I have a very simple explanation for that, that 
doesn't involve Xitami, your computer, or the fundamentals of TCP/IP 
being broken.
