I am still running classic on XP - I see there is a new X5 version out
but it does not as yet support virtual hosts from what I read.

What have you moved to if not Apache ?

I've been a long time user of classic Xitami, now I must bid a fond
farewell. The problems I have encountered after upgrading to MS Vista
have been way too painful. My web server seemed to be down more than up.
So, I have moved on to a different web server. The new web server does
everything Xitami did and more (asp) and no it's not Apache.

Yeah I'm not real happy with Vista at least at work because they kept all
the security crap in it. However here on my home system I turned all that
crap off. Vista seems to be pretty stable but Xitami doesn't play real nice.
As a matter of fact Xitami didn't play well with my XP system either. I
stuck with it because I liked the simplicity and I was use to it. I'm sure
it is fine with Linux though but I'm not a Linux person.

I'm also using Abyss, but i'm not impressed:
- Sometimes forget the correct headers (content-type....)
  In case i use content-encoding: gzip it means the user gets junk
displayed (had to switch off compression!)
- Doesn't perform cgi-bin as well as Xitami
- No hierarchical configuration (need to configure each host separately
instead of using globals)
- No easy plain ini files
- Doesn't handle multiple connections as well as Xitami
  (can't run an exe while objects on a page are being transfered)

It's not a router thing (tried 5 different brands), it's not a OS thing
(win XP SP2), Xitami was running fine on this server before.
Can't switch back since i put a lot of time rewriting all executables to
Abyss format (but i would love if i had plenty of time!)

I'm now a linux guy and I use lighttpd - pretty good comprehensible
CFG files - especially for virtual hosts. I also use httpi (the perl
webserver) for some test places since I appreciate its hackability.
But I wouldn't recommend httpi as a server that the public has access
too in the way I use it....
