Subject: [Xitami] Also in need of help


I have enjoyed flawless Xitami service for three years and suddenly, the
program will not even start on my system.  It appeared that the latest
Norton security download messed this up for me and I've since completely
uninstalled Norton, but Xitami will not start.  I did a system restore and
still nothing.

Thoughts?

Jill


Hello Jill

Norton mess quite a lot in your inner computer settings (System hooks ...)
In more extreme cases it's possible that your computer doesn't have internet
access anymore after unsuccessfully removing norton.

Norton has a remover on his site. (more than one version is available
depending on the norton av version you have).
You should try this first.

The aim is not to remove the application, but to get the system hooks right
again.

System restore will restore applications, but is quite useless in restoring
a system that's not functionning normally.

If everything fails, backup your configuration and do a format.
