<PRE>&gt;<i> In 2004 a friend helped me set up Xitami V. 2.5c1. Originally it was
</I>on  
&gt;<i> Windows 98SE. I upgraded to Win 2000 Pro.  I had saved the Xitami file
</I>and 
&gt;<i> just reloaded it after installing the new O.S.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you please explain to me what is happening and what to do, very  
</I>&gt;<i> clearly and simply? I have computer knowledge, but when it comes to  
</I>&gt;<i> programs like this, its difficult. And I am nervous about messing with
</I>
&gt;<i> something I don't understand well.  
</I>
Did you simply drop the executable file in a folder after the new OS
upgrade, or did you run the Xitami Windows installation file and fully
install it again?

It's not exactly clear from your description, what the problem might be.
More detail is needed about what you did after the Win 2000 Pro upgrade,

ie what kind of a file, named what, inside a folder named what, and did
you get any pop-up messages from your system while you did all these,
etc.

(And please don't send Xitami List e-mails in html format but in plain
text format because it translates into pages and pages of source html
when text Xitami list receives it.)
