Xitami needs other iMatix tools, which are on imatix.com, but I agree
it's hard for people to contribute to the project.

If you want to help, why not start a Xitami development wiki, using
something like wikidot.com, which is a free wiki farm I use for a lot
of projects.  All your questions have answers, but it's probably
better to turn this discussion into usable help for others, than to
discuss by email.

</I>
Xitami was based on a server framework (SMT) which we have rewritten
several times since that time.  We're now using SMT/5 in other
projects, and one of these - a new messaging server called OpenAMQ -
will be released fairly soon.

In OpenAMQ there is also a new HTTP server, still very small, but I
see this as eventually becoming a new Xitami.  There is always space
for a small, fast, easy to configure web server.
