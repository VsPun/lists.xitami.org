<PRE>Just last night I was notified that Xitami Pro was dying a nasty death 
on me..

Windows 2000 Server, latest service packs, running Xitami Pro 2.4d9. 
Other software of note, Microsoft's DNS server, PHP, MySQL and a POL 
(Ultima Online) server.

The message in my event logs was something along the lines of &quot;Memory 
leak, check memtrace.lst&quot;

I can email the memtrace.lst if necessary, I looked at it and it didn't 
tell me much of anything.

The only clue I have is that I had some &quot;person&quot; submitting multiple 
requests for the same file in rapid succession. Some 2000+ requests in a 
little less than 12 hours. The file does exist and is ~2MB in size. At a 
few points in time there were 30 open connections to the same IP for 
this file. Xitami would die during those periods.

I'm not really sure what information is needed, let me know and I'll do 
my best to provide it.
