Looks like you will need to port-forward port 80 in your router to your
Windows hosting machine.  Also, you will need to permanently assign an
internal IP address to your hosting machine.

When the game is over, both the king and the pawn are put into the same box.

  Subject: [Xitami] Running server through a router


  I am trying to run the Xitami web server on my WIndows XP machine that is
connected to the internet via a cable modem (RoadRunner/Motorola Surboard).
The internet connection is split amongst 2 computers using a Linksys router.
When I start the web server everything seems fine, but when I try to access
the web page I have loaded on the server by connecting to my internet
connection's (cable modem) IP address, I am directed to the router's
configuration page.  This also happens when the server is turned off, so
it's not a big suprise.  What is odd is that when I try to connect to the
router's config page by entering the router's default IP address into IE, I
am not taken to the config page as usual, but I'm instead directed to the
web page I have installed on the Xitami web server.  When the web server is
turned off I go straight to the config page as expected.  It seems like
somehow the router's IP is bouncing me back from the router to the computer
with the server installed, and the cable modem's (internet connection) IP is
forwarding straight to the router and never reaching the computer with the
server installed.  I assume this is a relatively simple fix for any of you
that are knowledgeable with networks, but I can't figure out what to do to
fix this &amp; make it work with my set up.  I also cant run the server and a
file sharing program like KazaA or WinMX.  Is there a way to allow for these
programs and the server to all run together harmoniously?  Thanks in advance
for any help, and I apologize if this question has already been beaten to
death.

  Steve
