<PRE>  Hello Tom,

  Thank you for replying!  I saw that too.  This has happened more than 
once!  I use a free DNS  service &quot;Domaincow&quot; (only because I don't know how 
to do it any other way), and 216.204.150.251 is in fact one of the DNS 
servers there at Domaincow..  I have the option of logging in and changing 
that back to my IP address.  Is this what I need to do?  I have read several 
times 'here on this list' about some of you running your own DNS, or DNS 
servers etc;  Is this a better way?  IS it something that I should be doing, 
and what does it consist of if you think I should!  Thanks again Tom!  I 
will wait for you to tel me, and I will then go change the web site address 
back to my own, if I should!  Have a good day!

&gt;<i>   Hello and good holidays to everyone,
</I>
Likewise!

&gt;<i>   I'm not sure how or why, but all of a sudden, the pages on my site are
</I>not
&gt;<i>recognized under the domain name!  In other words, If I wanted to view
</I>page
&gt;<i>&quot;rules/index.html&quot;  in the &quot;rules&quot; directory, I cannot get there via:
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.sorcep.com/rules/index.html,">http://www.sorcep.com/rules/index.html,</A> but I CAN get to it using the
</I>&gt;<i>numerical address of: <A HREF="http://65.68.25.113/rules/index.html..">http://65.68.25.113/rules/index.html..</A>  The ONLY
</I>page
&gt;<i>on my site that recognizes the words &quot;sorcep.com&quot; is the home page..
</I>IOW's
&gt;<i>you CAN get to my site by typing <A HREF="http://www.sorcep.com,">http://www.sorcep.com,</A> but you CAN NOT
</I>get
&gt;<i>past that page, to ANY directory using sorcep.com. INstead you MUST use
</I>the
&gt;<i>numerical address!  Can someone please lend a hand, (advice) on what may
</I>&gt;<i>have happened here?  Thanks much, and again, good holidays to you all!
</I>&gt;<i>

I looked up the DNS entries for both sorcep.com and www.sorcep.com and they
returned an A-record IP of 216.204.150.251

When I go to this address, it is DomainCow. So I assume you are doing so
sort of IP-forwarding? It sure seems like the problem lies there.

Tom
