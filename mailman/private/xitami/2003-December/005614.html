I am trying to run the Xitami web server on my WIndows XP machine that =
is connected to the internet via a cable modem (RoadRunner/Motorola =
Surboard).  The internet connection is split amongst 2 computers using a =
Linksys router.  When I start the web server everything seems fine, but =
when I try to access the web page I have loaded on the server by =
connecting to my internet connection's (cable modem) IP address, I am =
directed to the router's configuration page.  This also happens when the =
server is turned off, so it's not a big suprise.  What is odd is that =
when I try to connect to the router's config page by entering the =
router's default IP address into IE, I am not taken to the config page =
as usual, but I'm instead directed to the web page I have installed on =
the Xitami web server.  When the web server is turned off I go straight =
to the config page as expected.  It seems like somehow the router's IP =
is bouncing me back from the router to the computer with the server =
installed, and the cable modem's (internet connection) IP is forwarding =
straight to the router and never reaching the computer with the server =
installed.  I assume this is a relatively simple fix for any of you that =
are knowledgeable with networks, but I can't figure out what to do to =
fix this &amp; make it work with my set up.  I also cant run the server and =
a file sharing program like KazaA or WinMX.  Is there a way to allow for =
these programs and the server to all run together harmoniously?  Thanks =
in advance for any help, and I apologize if this question has already =
been beaten to death.
