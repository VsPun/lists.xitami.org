Subject: [Xitami] Current status of X5?
Message-ID: <BAY127-DAV9E3B8A7E025888B2FC2B5F8390@phx.gbl>

Hello all.

I haven't heard much chatter about X5 on the email forum and I have gone the 
x5 wikidot site for additional info.  But since X5 was released back in 
February can anyone elaborate on its performance, capabilities and features 
and do so when comparing them against Xitami 2.4x/2.5x versions.  I was 
highly excited to know X5 was going to be revived and would love to move to 
it if it was ready to replace the previous 2.x versions.

How is the development coming along, what are its current features sets and 
what have been users experiences with it?

Thanks for any insights you can provide.

-Russel

Currently X5 is a minimal server focussed on security and scalability.
 It's running live here: http://legacy.xitami.com/index.htm.  The
feature set has not changed since February.

This is not going to be a fast-moving project but X5 will continue to
develop and grow, as it is the front-end for our web-based messaging.
