There are 20 such entries.  It looks to me like this person was trying to

Should not it be 403, forbidden, or do I not have the system secured
properly?

You will only get 403 forbidden if you are using HTTP authentication.

Message-ID: <000e01c62734$e044b660$2002a8c0@achab.it>

Hi everybody,

background: I have a CGI script that runs on xitami web server and parse a template to 
produce an html output
This script works fine on a certain number of installation of xitami webserver (20+)

Now one of my customer is experiencing http error 503 (taken from xitami error.log) when
using HTTP POST to my scripts.
HTTP GET seems to work fine
My customer reported he's using xitami 2.5

Is there any way to get some more info from xitami about what's going wrong?
Is there any particular log file I have to look for (or enable)?


thank you very much for your help
stefano

Message-ID: <6.2.0.14.0.20060203082417.01c9b9a0@mail.mrjdesign.net>


I have been using and testing Xitami with my VB cgi's for some 5 years now.
Never before have I seen such odd behaviour as the past two days.

I built my cgi on a box running XP Pro sp1

I intend to run them on the exact same configuration Xitami 2.5 with XP pro sp1

In this cgi I have a call for the following


sFilePath = App.path & "\lst\_filename.hit"

then open the file and increment a number and close it again... basic hit count

When i run it on the dev station it executes fast and excellent like it should

When I execute this on a setup on my server machine I get


Error msg (if any): X:\webroot\TheDomainName\cgi-bin\lst\filename.hit
The following internal error has occurred:
File not found Error Number =  53


Ohhhh boy

Well to begin with, for some obscure reason, on the server machine it 
doesn't really come back this way.

If I do a set call to the exact path, hard coded, that's what it look like

When I do a call app.path in VB it comes back as

X:\webroot\TheDom~1\cgi-bin\lst\filename.hit

Why in heavens name it suddenly started doing short filenames and paths I 
cannot understand.

Does anyone have a clue as to how to disable this goof ball function in my 
machine so my Xitami will run as a normal machine again?

Thank you in advance.

A little update after testing even more with all settings, including 
running the value - 1 to disallow creation of short file names in the registry.

I can create the file, write to it by using Print #iFileNumber, "0"

but still not read the file or even see it in the CGI.

Windows can see it alright, and I can list it and so on, but the CGI 
doesn't appear to have the right permissions.

I didn't think Xitami was permission dependant on windows for access to 
some folders, when running Xitami as Admin

Problem solved...
Apparently the error through a fit before the actual location in the code. 
As usual, the problem remains the same.
An issue with the device located between the screen parsing data going to 
the keyboard (^^)

(in other words, input error)

The problem was very simple, the output code depends on a text file containing
the formatting for the header and footer in the CGI result, and these two 
files
where missing due to a simple copy error.

I keep having to remind myself, that the error is not what is last 
returned, but what was NOT last returned.
Sorry to bug the board, but perhaps someone can learn from my mistake too.

Thanks.  I've been using WHOIS and blocking the whole range of IPs if they

Hi
I've just downloaded the Xitami and I'm having trouble accessing the admin section to configure the server.

I've read the faq section and it says to create a defaults.cfg file and defaults.aut file.

How do I create them? and what folder do I put them in?

Kind Regards

Mark

Defaults.cfg is an identical copy of xitami.cfg

Just copy and paste it in the same directory, where also your xigui32.exe 
is located.
That should resolve any issues, in fact the need for a defaults.cfg is only 
apparent if
you ever need to reinstall xitami or if you are using virtual servers 
hosting and have to
manage more than one hosted section.

In all other cases it is only a recommendation.

The same for defaults.aut, otherwise it's in xitami.aut

In the defaults.cfg or xitami.cfg add the following settings after 
installing PHP4 and restart your Xitami when done
==================================================================================
Hi,

here the settings for php.

[Filter]
     .php = "D:/PHP/php.exe"

[Mime]
     Php = "application/x-httpd-php"

In the filter section note the forward slahes. I had to use those, 
backslash didn't work for me.

Hi Mark,
as php is running as cgi and using the php.exe I assume it will not
matter. I am still running php 4.3.11
To see if it's working create a file with a text editor like notepad with
the following, you can cut and paste

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

name it phpinfo.php. Make sure that you have the correct extension .php
not .txt
After that, call the file from your browser and if it's working correctly
you should get a purple page with lot's information.

Johannes

In reference to our previous discussion urging the team to pick up 
development of this great product again.

Here is a little sample of me running 4 web sites for the time Jan 27, 2006 
7 AM until today Feb 10, 2006 5.20 AM

RESP.            SUM       RATIO

200              372,868     98.648%
206                     202      0.053%
226                         4     0.001%
230                         2     0.001%

530                         2    0.001%


SUM ALL              377,979  hits from 12,997 Unique IP addresses in this 
time.


I am still investigating what the 404's are but I think their from two 
nasty things.
1) Site pages I pulled off of my server about two years ago still pulling 
up on google and

2) The FireFox browser eternally asking for favicon.ico every time it hits 
a web site, without necessarily one is specified.

Anyway, the server is holding up great, except when I get a lot of hits on 
big files (200 Mb +) and
have more than 8 sim. visitors, they get trouble and the server conks out 
with a 206 response or 403 error.

Less than 1.35 % failure ratio over all is not bad for being a Xitami 
freeware server huh?

I am convinced that this must be a bug in XITAMI. I've eliminated everything

The problem is very easy to recreate. It will occur every time stdio=0 is

I've recreated the failure linking to routines in cgi-bin that I have coded
using two different REXX products and a .bat file. The failure occurs after
the cgi-bin routine terminates.
These files will recreate the problem.

How do I resolve this the best way?

Any file, not directly executable stored in the CGI-BIN can be downloaded 
in a browser by simply pointing at it.
In IIS for instance you can turn that behavior off and only allow execute 
but not download.

Is that possible in Xitami too?

Anwsering my own question after reading up a bit on this, I would assume 
under the Xitami.cfg [CGI] section


#   If 1, allows images, HTML, and other files in the cgi-bin
#   directory. The CGI program can refer to these using relative
#   addressing. If 0, such files are not permitted. Note that in any
#   case, executable files (such as Perl scripts) are always executed,
#   never downloaded.

     mixed-url=1


should be set to 0 to avoid any troubles?

Message-ID: <6.2.0.14.0.20060212072214.01c52b10@mail.mrjdesign.net>

Now I have spent nearly a week working out some minor issues with a CGI 
configuration in VB.

It is not the VB part that is causing grievances, as that I have down pat, 
however the problem is as follows.

My test machine is...

Win XP SP1 with Xitami 2.5 C2 running a single website in the local NAT
It has the default configuration files for the CGI environment as left 
intact from setup.
I have MDAC 2.8, MS Jet4.0 updates and all installed.

My server, live machine

has the indentical configuration as above, with two differences
1) it has twice as much memory and drive space
2) it also has a defaults.cfg file for defining some 10 virtual domains, 
each with the std. setup for each.

One further difference in this is

the workstation works fine

the server station does NOT.

The errors I am getting are almost ridiculous.

Std. windows error #13 Type error.

I pass a internal call in the cgi called CGI_UserAgent which supposedly 
returns the browser data.

It works just fine on the workstation, AND on the server in an other cgi I 
wrote using the same bas file.

It does not in this but gives me this error.

I rem the line, recompile and try again.

Then I get a problem in the very next line, saying the same thing for 
CGI_RemoteAddress
which is just getting the visitors IP address in a string.

This too, works in another cgi on both machines, but not in this one on the 
server.

For reference, the CGI's use standard I/O calls and work just ok in all 
other cases.
Only these bugs are about to drive me nuts.

Does anyone have any idea as to why Xitami suddenly is so unstable??

Message-ID: <6.2.0.14.0.20060212114024.01c66460@mail.mrjdesign.net>

Further, VERY odd behaviors are now noted in this execution.

I loaded the entire load of data for testing over to the server machines 
root directory.
Now, it is loaded in to the default directory of Xitami, bypassing any 
virtual host paths and so on.
This in it self should not have any bearing on the serving of pages, let 
alone the execution of the very same code.

After all I can easily pull the same information in a JS page or similar 
script without any issues.

However, to further complicate the issue.

The server box is running through dual NICs

Assume for the sake of conversation that I have a

http://localhost which is 127.0.0.1

Then I have two (2) IP addresses which are public (Static) to the internet

10.0.0.99 and 10.0.0.98

(of course these are fictitious and should be (83.###.#.##) and something 
else but it's an example)

When I execute the CGI on 127.0.0.1/MyPage.htm and send the call by a 
simple GET to the CGI-BIN the code works perfectly!
Not a single fault anywhere to be seen.

When I execute the code on 10.0.0.99 it bumps me around saying, I executed 
from a non permissable CGI_Referer
HA... the code actually works.

I wrote a thing that disallows cross linking from other domains so you 
can't run the cgi embedded in an other web site and call my pages from the 
other site.

Then, thinking logically...

If the 10.0.0.99 page is disallowed, the page will thereby assume it self 
as running on 10.0.0.98 in this case,
so the thread in Xitami actually waking up to the call to the page is 
located on the other IP.

I opened a page in 10.0.0.98/MyPage.htm instead and executed the click by 
doing a Get for the page

myCGI.exe?Param1=0&Param2=6574&Param3=9&ParamText=

is now returning the same goofball errors as before.

Previously noted above, everything picks up correctly, and is collected as 
should be.
In this case, when being on the correct IP and all, the cgi doesn't even 
allow me to get CG_Referer as a string.
Nor CG_RemoteAddr or any other data.

Talk about  a backwards acting resolution of the system


So in conclusion.


1) I have to remove my IP blocking system and open up for cross linking or 
I have to find a way to allow two or more CGI_Referer values to enable this 
security feature when running Xitami on dual NIC's

2) Has anyone else had any experience with trying to limit callers from 
other domains to avoid getting connections from outside URL's and IP's, and 
how did you solve this?

Thankful for any hints and pointers as usual.

I hope someone can remark on the real causes/solutions you are looking
for. 

You probably knnow these already, buf if all else fails some plain old
solutions: 

In order to restrict requests to the cgi-bin entirely, 
- you could password-protect the cgi-bin directory through a
"mywebsite.aut".

To restrict access to this particular cgi program 
- you can put the program in an individual directory under cgi-bin and
password-protect that one
- you can use a cookies + login module 
- if all your internal IPs are known and permanent, you can use a module
to disallow all other IPs.

However, to further complicate the issue.

The server box is running through dual NICs

Assume for the sake of conversation that I have a 

http://localhost <http://localhost/>  which is 127.0.0.1

Then I have two (2) IP addresses which are public (Static) to the
internet 

10.0.0.99 and 10.0.0.98

(of course these are fictitious and should be (83.###.#.##) and
something else but it's an example)

When I execute the CGI on 127.0.0.1/MyPage.htm and send the call by a
simple GET to the CGI-BIN the code works perfectly!
Not a single fault anywhere to be seen.

When I execute the code on 10.0.0.99 it bumps me around saying, I
executed from a non permissable CGI_Referer
HA... the code actually works.

I wrote a thing that disallows cross linking from other domains so you
can't run the cgi embedded in an other web site and call my pages from
the other site.

Then, thinking logically...

If the 10.0.0.99 page is disallowed, the page will thereby assume it
self as running on 10.0.0.98 in this case, 
so the thread in Xitami actually waking up to the call to the page is
located on the other IP.

I opened a page in 10.0.0.98/MyPage.htm instead and executed the click
by doing a Get for the page

myCGI.exe?Param1=0&Param2=6574&Param3=9&ParamText=

is now returning the same goofball errors as before.

Previously noted above, everything picks up correctly, and is collected
as should be.
In this case, when being on the correct IP and all, the cgi doesn't even
allow me to get CG_Referer as a string.
Nor CG_RemoteAddr or any other data.

Talk about  a backwards acting resolution of the system


So in conclusion.


1) I have to remove my IP blocking system and open up for cross linking
or I have to find a way to allow two or more CGI_Referer values to
enable this security feature when running Xitami on dual NIC's

2) Has anyone else had any experience with trying to limit callers from
other domains to avoid getting connections from outside URL's and IP's,
and how did you solve this?

Thankful for any hints and pointers as usual.

	I rem the line, recompile and try again.
	
	Then I get a problem in the very next line, saying the same
thing for CGI_RemoteAddress
	which is just getting the visitors IP address in a string.
	
	This too, works in another cgi on both machines, but not in this
one on the server.
	
	For reference, the CGI's use standard I/O calls and work just ok
in all other cases.
	Only these bugs are about to drive me nuts.
	
	Does anyone have any idea as to why Xitami suddenly is so
unstable??

What I was looking more or less to do, is adding a way to monitor
A) who the requesting IP is, and block them on 
the fly if they hit to hard or to frequent
B) to log the incoming IP to verify at the same 
time if the CGI referer is local or from an
outside source, in which case I can refuse 
connections and send them to the primary
access page, routing all traffic from the own web 
site to access the page in question.

The later I will likely have to do using a simple 
JavaScript testing the referer vs. the document.domain property.

Thanks for your other hints though.

All you have written below is a little complicated to understand. I
don't write in VB for example, I write in Perl. 

And I haven't been able to understand why the NICs influence what
happens  and how the IP is a problem. Unless you have assigned
independent config files and disabled cgi in each and everyone of these
problem IPs you mention, the IP should not matter. A referrer is a
referrer, a simple url, no matter which IP or domain it is located on.

1) I have not been able to find a Std. windows error #13 Type error. The
ones I know have three digits. Eg: Error Code 121.
What does the #13 Type error say? 

3) If CGI is enabled on all of the 10 different domain configurations,
the http-referer and the remote-addr fields are on the environment hash
by default (environment=0). You do not have to set the environment to 1
in config to have them on the hash. 

4) The http-referer will exist in the environment hash, only if there
actually was a referrer (a mouse click on a link or a submit button on a
real page bringing the user to your url). If the url was typed into the
address bar of the browser, there will be no http-referer. Then your
program  can not read it then from the environment hash.

5) Did you print out the environment hash to yourself, under the
conditions that the error occurs in your browser? What do the fields
say? Which IP do you appear to have when the error occurs? What does the
http-referer say? What does your program do with this information? In
which line of your program does the problem happen? Is your test logic
entirely correct?

Message-ID: <6.2.5.6.0.20060220180742.01bd2810@mrjdesign.net>



The Xitami server I am running, 2.5c2 seems to 
hold up very well as far as running html and some other simple CGI's on.
However I keep have a huge problem. Whenever I 
turn my back on the machine, it crashes.

I'm serious, not kidding, as long I am working on 
the machine or looking at the server, it seems ok and has no crashes at all.
As soon I leave it to itself for a day, I get a hung up on something.

I turned on the debug options and the debug 
option for CGI's as well and I cant even see any 
debug log files for the server in these 
instances, which leads me to believe everything 
is fine with the CGI's and the HTML.

I spent a day the other week cleaning up any 
missing linked background images and so on, and 
that doesn't seem to fix the problem either.

The logs are approx. as follows.

10 % goes to one virtual host which is serving 
practically one or two images to a forum, as an off site image linker only.

20% to another virtual host which has received 
about  19-20,000 pageviews in the past two weeks.
         Multiply this with about 12 for the 
actual number of logged hits to the server logs.

2% of the hits go to a base web site mentioned 
below. This is just a light weight survey CGI 
running up that right now and only some minute hits so far.

All the other hits go to a image archive web 
site, which logs app. 12-14 hits per pageview and 
so far I got 5000 pageviews in the past 5 days.

It's not that big at all when you consider the 
comparative number of hits I can see on Apache servers and IIS machines around.

What actually happens is, two out of three 
crashes state there is a C++ error in Xitami and 
it must be restarted and you are shown the option to restart .

1/3 of the crashes are critical and gives me a 
C++ error and the server simply shuts down. You 
are not show the option to restart in this case.

The really nasty thing is nothing works until you 
manually go in and restart the server in which 
time the sites all appear as off line and refuse connections.

Since I don't have the form titles I cant write a 
program to catch these events as they appear and 
do some automation task to make up for it.

Does anyone have any suggestions in how to resolve this?

Thanks in advance.

If you have enabled FTP, switch it off.  This is one common cause for crashes.

I turned off the FTP completely since I dont 
really use it for this current setup and I am 
looking to use an SFTP solution in a near future.
The FTP does not have any effect on this since It's all off.

Error #13 is MS Error for type casting in VB.
Basically it should only appear if you try to set a Long value to a 
Double or a Long to a String
You should be able to pass anything to a Variant in VB since it's 
accepting anything but not even that worked.

The CGI_Referer is a function in the CGI itself that picks up on the 
servers values.
It works fine and can catch it, except when it started thinking there 
was a type error for some very odd reason.
The only thing I could not understand in this type problem was why it 
works fine on the development machine but not the server and I 
manually checked all config files to validate they are identical indeed.

True, which is quite ok.
Youre not supposed to be able to type in the URL directly nor link 
from a URL outside the domains path to the cgi I wrote.
When that happens it will refer the user back to the index page and 
require they come in the "assigned and controlled way"

The logic of the testing seems OK.
What in fact happens the way it is setup is as follows


Xitami controls the servers and assign all domains to listen to all 
incoming IP's

DNS on the other hand refers all but one of my domains to the primary 
IP number.
The last one, which is the largest one, with most hits, get assigned WWW and
*.Sitename.com access through both IP numbers on the box.

In this way it servers as a load balancing.

The problem is that this will also affect the CGI's on the site as 
the site can internally call itself by the following means

www.Sitename.com
sitename.com
##.##.##.1
##.##.##.2

and all are valid CGI_Referer

This is where it confuses the CGI and the Xitami server but this is 
controlled by the DNS in the end.

I will see if I cant work around this in a bit different way and if I 
find a good solution I might post a message to
the board about it too if someone else would like to have a solution like this.

Now that could be a reason, but I have never had a problem with Norton before.
In fact I have used this very same setup for 
years and never experienced as many crashes as recently.

I am leaning more towards the large numbe of hits 
to different virtual hosts causing some overload and
xitami not being able to a) rotate the logs fast 
enough or b) not being able to route the traffic fast enough.

Very possible, but I have the same problem. it will crash after awhile and I
don't know why. It may run for days before it crashes. I'm not real happy
with the stablility. I'm running about 10 sites, I can site at the server
all day doing any number of things, leave it alone for a hour and crash. Try
to just restart it but it doesn't like that very much so a reboot is in
order. But I can do a reboot then leave it for the weekend come back on
monday and find that it crashed. Sure it might not be playing well with
other services but that's a problem. It needs to play well with others.
 
Anyway enough of my venting.
 
Have a nice day!!!

Definitely agree with you there

I just spoke to a friend who is running an Apache server with 100,000 
files on his site.
He has a log file buildup of about 100 Mb every 24 hours, which is huge.
I am really thankful Xitami doesn't do that to me, since I normally 
get 100 Mb in a week on 100,000 files.

Although, if its not able to rotate that little amount, what will 
happen when I start getting a higher number of hits on say 25 sites?

I have started to learn Apache and have put it on my new win2003 server for
higher end sites. I'll be keeping xitami for some small sites but may
eventually move everything over. Xitami has been good for me for the most
part. It's great for development but I wanted something capable of doing mod
rewrites and ASP with less crashes. I still have about 10 sites on my xitami
server, move 3 off to the Apache server.

Just a quick thought:

    My regular Xitami server (p166 orphan) runs flawlessly for months at a time, although I'm not pushing the traffic you guys are.  However, in order to add some disk space without having everything go down for a while, I moved all server stuff to an older computer (docked Toshiba 205 Laptop) with Win98SE and test ran it.  CRASHed overnight!  My working laptop is also a 205 and since I upped it to Win98SE, I crash regularly, usually with the network pc card installed but sometimes not.

  The best I can figure it is that somewhere a wakeup command doesn't process right and it locks up.  Usually the computer has been inactive for a long while (hour +) and has screen and disks timed off.  Sometimes it wakes up, sometime it doesn't.  Sometimes it went to sleep with IE on screen, sometimes not.  None of this seems Xitami related although an active TCP/IP connection is suspicious.  Running test right now without any software loaded.

I thought display drivers were involved but not.  Thought maybe a TCP/IP hangup (memory leak?).  Just not everything wakes up after a nap. ACPI maybe?  Power Management?

Hope this is helpful,

Charles

Configuration:
Xitami 2.5c2 (virtual host) on P166 (Win98SE) w/ 256mb, Php 4.something, MySQL something,
FD Daemon, Mercury Mail, AVGFree, ZoneAlarm.

Just to see if it makes a difference I turned off 
all power saving related things on the server and 
will leave it at that for now.
I actually once asked a few friends, (just over 
45,000) in a forum to hit the living h*** out of 
the machine while streaming a little video clip on it.
That in it self did nothing to the xitami server 
but it did slow down the connections of course.

That's why I have a hard time understanding why 
the Xitami would react so adversely to log files building up.
Perhaps the power saving is an issue.

You on the other hand is running 98SE and we're 
on NT based O/S's with XP so there is a major 
difference in how TCP/IP is handled I would assume.

Your configuration is
>Configuration:
>Xitami 2.5c2 (virtual host) on P166 (Win98SE) w/ 
>256mb, Php 4.something, MySQL something,
>FD Daemon, Mercury Mail, AVGFree, ZoneAlarm.

and as a comparison I am now testing out the following...

Xitami 2.5c2, (with 12 vhosts) on a P4 3.0 GHz 
Hyper threaded Intel 1 mb buffer, (no PHP or 
MySQL which saves me 12 Mb memory btw.)
I run 1 GB DRAM and have 2 x 250 GB disk space 
200 Gb dedicated for the vhosts and the rest for mail and dns

Norton Antivirus for now, ZoneAlarm for testing 
(I tried outpost too but it locked up the 
services totally and takes to much overhead)
MailEnable Std. Mail server and BIND for DNS serving.

On that note, has there been any new development with Xitami over the years?  Will they continue to develop it at all or will it simply become obsolete?  I run the standard version 2.4d9 on Win2K and am going to probably upgrade to the professional version at some point but I have been on this version for several years now.  The latest version isn't to far past the version I am running which tells me that 2.5c2 was completed years ago and there haven't been any newer versions since.

  I have started to learn Apache and have put it on my new win2003 server for higher end sites. I'll be keeping xitami for some small sites but may eventually move everything over. Xitami has been good for me for the most part. It's great for development but I wanted something capable of doing mod rewrites and ASP with less crashes. I still have about 10 sites on my xitami server, move 3 off to the Apache server.

  Definitely agree with you there

  I just spoke to a friend who is running an Apache server with 100,000 files on his site.
  He has a log file buildup of about 100 Mb every 24 hours, which is huge.
  I am really thankful Xitami doesn't do that to me, since I normally get 100 Mb in a week on 100,000 files.

  Although, if its not able to rotate that little amount, what will happen when I start getting a higher number of hits on say 25 sites?

    Now that could be a reason, but I have never had a problem with Norton before.
    In fact I have used this very same setup for years and never experienced as many crashes as recently.

    I am leaning more towards the large numbe of hits to different virtual hosts causing some overload and 
    xitami not being able to a) rotate the logs fast enough or b) not being able to route the traffic fast enough.

Indeed.  Xitami does have some quirks, but one of the things that
makes it so nice is that the multithreaded engine is very robust
against load.  You should not be able to crash it simply by loading
it, and I've never seen that happen, except with some FTP transfers.

Message-ID: <6.2.5.6.0.20060220205036.01c7d068@mrjdesign.net>


I was sitting here reading through the entire 
online manual of Xitami and found a very 
interesting entry I had not paid attention to previously.

The maual reads...
"32-bit executable .exe files. The files do not 
actually need an .exe. extension; Xitami will 
execute a file with any name so long as it is in 
the CGI directory and 'looks' like an executable 
file (precisely: it must start with the letters "MZ") "

If a CGI is a 32 bit exe-cutable and is not named 
MZ_SomeFileName.exe, would that be the cause of these many crashes then?
Why MZ? since when is that a requirement for any server standard ?

The file must literally start with MZ, as the first two bytes of its
content.  This is the standard defined by some programmer working for
Microsoft, years ago, who's initials were M.Z.

As far I can tell there are no plans on picking up a development on 
the Xitami server from Imatix again, which in it self is really sad.
What I have decided to do for now is wait but I have a friend 
studying in Denmark at the moment who should be coming over here 
shortly and he's a real guru with C and C++.
I will likely try to have my company spend some time and money on 
this guy for a uni project and have him revise Xitami by the open source.

If I can afford to sponsor this guy, I bet it could become a good 
project for developing a very stabile platform
server and also give something back to the Xitami community as a whole.

When the time is right and I start this up, I'll keep this forum 
posted on any such plans as well.

That would be a fun project.  Xitami is actually quite easy to
improve, once you understand how the technology works.  Much easier
than normal multithreaded code.

But it's a lot of work, making releases and supporting a user
community.  Too much work for us, we had to get back to our jobs and
families...

If your friend needs any help understanding the technology, he can email me.

Thank you Peter. I will surely keep your email as a reference for this project.

I am actually, perhaps naively so but still, not 
very concerned about the support and community 
issues as I can easily put together a good system for that here.
Once we come that far, I would certainly be 
interested in picking up some of that load from my servers side as well.

Mike.

I have no use for a screen saver as I don't have a screen on the machine. :)

And no, the native firewall only runs on XP boxes 
that has one. I was not "PutSuitableWordHere"
enough to install the SP2 that adds #Nth errors 
to an O/S that already had 250 on there to begin with.

Amazingly stupid to release a SP that disables 
both generic Norton and McAffee anti viruses.

We'll see how the power save turned off pans out. 
It's still running as is now though since I did.

Message-ID: <6.2.5.6.0.20060221031610.01bd3b20@mrjdesign.net>

Ok... server still hanging in there.
In fact I disabled the access log and retain only 
error log and other logs generated by Xitami.
Disabled all the power saving features and stuff, 
and the server seems to run a little bit more stabile.

Now I have another security related question, and 
more along the files of the contents of the log files and some odd entries.


has anyone ever seen an entry such as this to their log files before???


24.136.142.39 - - [21/Feb/2006:03:00:45 +0000] 
"harset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7" 501 0 "" ""

This is done by the std. CLFX formatted log file 
and pulled from my errors.log after I turned off access log.

There is apparently only one entry in there. Now 
I wonder, did osmeone try to pull a C# or .NET fast one and
accessing my keyboard hooks or is this a thing 
produced by this earthlink users browser suddenly 
not reading all file data correctly?

Thankful for any insight in this since this bugs 
me more than the server shutting down.

Interesting indeed.
The next time it does, will you do me a favor and see if we get the same error.

Catch exactly what it says in the title of the popup window that 
follows the error and I'll see if I cant write a quick-fix for it here.

Mine works outright fine for now since I turned off all powersave 
functions, including turn off monitor or hdd after XX minutes option, 
and I disabled Activity logging and only keep error log, console log 
and Xitami.log enabled.

Did you go into Device Manager, then to the LAN card(s) ->
Properties -> Power Management and uncheck "Allow the
computer to turn off this device to save power"? I just
found that this was enabled on my machine (XP SP2, a
desktop machine), so I presume this is the setting by
default, as long as the NIC drivers support it.
And maybe it is still worth removing Norton Antivirus for a
while, just for the test. If the server is not a file
server, then the lack of antivirus software for some time
won't do it much harm.

This is only on SP2 but default on all XP SP1 and up.
I am on SP1 and that thing is one of the first I kill with any fresh 
install (^^)

Also things like auto update, remote assistance and system restore will
get a well placed kick in the complexity before I go on line and 
update the avir and anti spybot  (^^)

Not needed. But Norton has never done any harm to my setup.
Apparently after turning off log files for activity logging and the 
power save totally, it works fine.

I'm sorry if this post is off-topic, I'm currently following this thread. I 
too had problems with crashes and I didn't manage to solve this. I 
experimented a lot and the problem occurred both in 4 branch as in 5 branch. 
I was using Xitami within a perl  connection to an application server 
connected to MySQL. I have seen posts here that MySQL settings had influence 
on the working of Xitami, but the crashes occurred very irregular, sometimes 
several times a day, sometimes it went well for over a week. It also isn't 
very stable if cgi apps with soap connections are used with similar problems 
(again using MySQL for whatever it's worth). Any similarities?

regards, Albert

I don't use MySQL at all. At least not yet, 
because I noticed that MySQL 5 builds up and 
steals 11 MB RAM just to not do nothing but sit there.
I am not sure what you mean by 4 branch and 5 branch here. Please elaborate.

I don't use Perl either because I like stuff 
that's compiled before I run it, and something I 
can manage to read after it was written /*chuckles

I do however use a frequent amount of ADO and 
MSJet towards Access databases in CGI's made using VB.
They do put a nice load on the server CPU but 
only for very short periods of time and
they don't affect the Xitami at all except for the execution time.

In fact, I have one web site running on my server 
now, using one of my CGI's handling over 45,000 images,
viewer stats and image stats all from one file 
towards a single access database and they don't seem to have
any problems whatsoever getting thousands of hits 
weekly. (20,000 page views in 2 1/2 weeks)

Another web site I host is running straight 
forward HTML and just one JAVA applet and that bad boy
is running up logs like crazy and sometimes takes 
for ever to load individual pages. Especially on the Java part.

The only time I've noticed any trouble with the 
CGI is when there is Perl involved for some reason.
Perhaps an interpreter issue in the back of it. I 
don't know and I am still waiting for my guru in Denmark to show up.

I am not sure how SOAP would compare with that.

Wiht the 4 and 5 branch I meant that I have tested2.4 and 2.5 in several releases, but they gave the same result.  I have p;osted on this discussion list questions about strange crashes but never got any answers. I too like compiled stuff in favor of php/perl, but my applications servers are fed by a very small perl script just passing data through to the app server and back. Under  certain circumstances (I realy do not know when )  the webserver crashes the same way you described. I also have a soap cgi applications (webservice built in Delphi ) running on Xitami giving the same results. Finally I noticed that the FTP part of Xitami is not stable at all. Being honest I was running Xitami for years just doing html stuff without any crashes at all. But since I was using  cgi applications and webscripting I simply couldnt get a stable environment. I'm using Apache now w.o. any problems,  but since Xitami is very easy to maintain (no difficult setup files), very small, I would surely like to use Xitami. But there's some isue here I couldn;t find. That's why I'm very interested in this thread because I hope to find out what I'm doing wrong or to find out it's a bug to be solved...

Thank you for explaining the 4 and 5...

I've used Xitami since I first started doing basic HTML code on my 
own just to have something to test it with,
instead of the old angelfire web sites as where massively popular back in 1995.

I think I am coming to a couple of conclusions in this Xitami bug 
issue, and they may be wrong,
until I get more into the source of the applications themselves, but 
here goes nothing.

1) The FTP server should clearly not be used.
     I have tried several other server versions, but what I like with 
Xitami is the simple and straight
     forward VHosting setup and that has lead me to keep running it 
until just a few weeks back.

    In fact I have always truly disliked Apache because of the setup 
and configuration that is so different than Xitami.

  I have tried RaidenFTP and I really like how stabile it is, how 
relatively easy it is to set up on a single
  machine but it's a nightmare trying to write a cgi myself to add or 
remove users. Xitami is unbeatable on ease of use there.
Also, there has to be some way they can keep a nag screen in the 
program without requiring the user who is
testing it to click on their web site ever 1 - 3 hours to keep the 
server alive. It's not only ridiculous but plain stupidly annoying so 
I dumped it.

Now I am testing Platypus FTP server that also support FTPS however 
it is very sluggish, takes for ever to refresh the remote side window 
in the client application.
Doesn't strike me as stabile at all.

So, in regards to Xitami, I disabled the FTP to begin with. This 
removed approx. 75% of all crashes, and in particular the one popping 
up showing C++ errors.
The C++ error leads me to believe there is something in Xitami that 
was not quite written right for an XP machine. After all, the later 
editions of XP, including later installs of SP1 versions does have 
things now included that did not exist back when Xitami's latest 
version was undergoing the highest attention I bet.


2) The CGI environment. Yes, you're absolutely right that it looks 
like parsing pages through an interpretor takes longer time and puts 
a certain load on your server.

Even more so if you add PHP that require a special parser and MIME 
entry to run. PERL is a bit more stabile here, however, I write 
mostly VB based compiled stuff, and the way I write it, it's intended 
to run server side and just return a minimal amount of data to the 
browser where needed.

Since I can't figure out how I first managed to get VBS to run on 
Xitami, I am stuck relearning a lot of my old JavaScript, and trying 
to reduce the load on the server, by pushing most of the front end 
stuff to the client this way. It's actually fairly simple to do, once 
you get an idea as how it runs behind the scene.

More about this below. but first...

3) The LOG files! Apparently a big culprit in causing errors.

There has to be some majestic buildup of data in this processing 
because of the following.

A) As soon I reach close to or over 8000 hits in the properties 
window field Hits: I risk having a crash.
B) If the sum of all hits add up in the kb transfered field, to over 
1,000,000, I know it's coming sooner or later.
C) If you run several VHost sites, I noticed, simply by opening the 
logs folder, to see that all sites hits are not stored in individual 
log files as one would assume.

Lets assume I have SiteA.log, SiteB.log, SiteC.log

I set the log files to cycle daily, without regard for any max size 
of the log files, and instead I end up with log files like this...

SiteA.log + 10 Kb
SiteB.log = 5,006 Kb
SiteC.log = 490 kb


I know, that this is wrong because SiteA.log should be huge and has 
25 times more hits than
SiteC, that currently stands for more than 95% of my mail servers 
traffic for instance.

In addition, I get Ac20022006log.001, Ac20022006log.002, 
Ac20022006log.003, Ac20022006log.004
all containing hits from all of the above.

How can that be "individual logging" for each vhost?  (makes a note 
to self for this years project with studying Xitami source to stop 
this concatenation of log files.)

I just completed a minor CGI that will write my own logs instead, 
saving each site for instance for my main domain as 
www.mrjdesign.net25022006.log for todays hits.
If I add another vhost, it will log in it's own domain+date and if 
the Cycle24hr is true, then it auto generates a new file every 24 
hours, otherwise every hour.

I turned off, the access log, kept the error log and xitami.log 
active, and voila, another 80% of all crash prone activities died.

In all honesty, I did turn of powersave, "turn off monitor after", 
and the "turn off harddisks after" settings as well.
Why you might ask, but someone suggested there was a backend issue 
with them, and perhaps this leads back
to my original theory above that something in C++ is conflicting with 
how the powersave is handled.

=== In conclusion

Since I did these changes and tests, I have had ONE server crash, and 
it was not on the main server but the developer station,
when I executed a cgi, repeatedly, in fact 1,338 times in the time 
span of less than 30 seconds.

I doubt in this case it was caused by the CGI, but once again a log 
file problem.
The CGI was executed through a javascript that kept calling the page, 
and it could not find one of the components the page referred to.
As such the error log kept building up instead, and thats when it crashed.

=== Now for something much more fun I noticed.

If you execute a CGI, try calling it by passing a action tag through 
JavaScript rather than calling it by other methods.
Why? you might ask.

It's quite simple, if you look at how the processes are executed.

Xitami is pretty strict on the time-out settings fro cgi's, and in my 
case I have it at 60 seconds by default.
Consider the one site I mentioned before, executing a check of 47,000 
images in a mdb file, towards a
VB cgi, running on xitami, its is sometimes dead slow when I have 
many visitors.

On the other hand, I have not yet had a time out error on that CGI, 
and it controls everything from logging
hits per thumbnail, hits per thumbnail page, visitors locations, and 
much more. (including looping and building thumbs pages)

Now, I tried something new, and found to my surprise it actually 
works pretty good.

(lets hope the mail server doesnt think this is a html include here now)

<script src="http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourCgi.exe"></script>

placed anywhere in your html page will execute the cgi as if you had 
clicked the submit button in a form.

So will the following...

<script src="http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourController.js"></script>

containing the script line ...

document.write("<script 
src=\"http://yoursite.com/cgi-bin/YourCgi.exe?PARAM1="+ What 
YouGotElsewhere +"&PARAM2="+ SomeOtherDynamicBit +"\"></script>");


This means, you can execute a huge collection of data through java 
script, build a connect string to your cgi and execute the cgi before 
it does the following...

The cgi in this case cannot push any data back to the calling page 
directly... so now we include a statement in the cgi saying

(this is VB guys)

'get out of the cgi  bin into the webpages directory of xitami...
sFILE = App.path "\..\webpages\temp.js"
FN = FreeFile
open sFILE for Output As #FN
Print #FN, "<!-- //"
Print #FN, "document.write(""Hello World, here is my temp value " & 
varDataFromCGI & """);"
Print #FN, "//  -->"
Close #FN



Since Xitami, and any decent server, slows down while the CGI is 
running, this gives you a whole
60 seconds to run what you are doing, produce this temp file and then 
return the processing to
the calling HTML document again.


Now, once the document is release... we are back in the body of the 
HTML page and there you have the following code...
AFTER the CGI and JS mix...


<script src="http://yoursite.com/tmp.js"></script>

and voila, there is your output, without pushing anything from the 
CGI to the HTML directly.

And from what I can tell, you can do this over and over and over, 
like a energizer bunny with a lot less stress on the server itself.
It's partly because now you pushed some of the details down to the 
user, and the CGI processing is only holding a thread for
the server but not communicating back as much as it otherwise would 
with stdio routines.

Well... I hope this is useful to you all. Otherwise I just spent 30 
minutes potential sleeping time typing for nothing >.<

First things first, stop calling every issue you have with Xitami 
"urgent". Every topic you have started cries wolf that way. Its not only 
annoying, its a good way to get ignored.

Since you seem to be having so many issues with the 2.5 series, how 
about trying an older version? That will give a baseline on where the 
'issues' you are having started.

 From a developers point of view its always nice to know when things 
start breaking.

I've run the 2.4dxx series for over 5 years now with -zero- issues at 
all for 13+ domains running all manner of CGI. Its been rock stable. 
Back up a bit and give us something to work with, it might pay off for you.

I have called two posted messages urgent, and both are referring to 
these crashes that suddenly became ever more frequent.
Having a site up (or 16 of them) and the server suddenly goes off 
line as soon you don't watch it, seems urgent to me, and more so to my clients.

However the many replies in this thread makes the topic stand out 
perhaps. I'll give you that.
If many replies and forwards of a certain thread is reason to ignore 
it, then that would be up to you.

As I said before, and as Peter also knows, I will likely send for a 
friend from Denmark after this semester is over and get to work on 
the source of Xitami.
As such, I'll be around in a whole different way, and hardly anything 
would seem urgent after that.

I also removed the Urgent word from the reply to this message, as it 
might please you a bit better too.
I will also of course follow your advise and pull a copy of the 2.4 
version to see if it will make a difference in this. It would be stupid not to.

Thank you for your advise.

- Mike

Try setting your xitami.aut and the ftpdirs.aut as well as 
ftpusers.aut to reflect the same usage and passwords if you have the 
section [ftp] enabled.
That I recall fixed it for me when I tried to log in using the web

But that was a while ago since I stopped using the web access since I 
find editing the aut files is easier by hand.

Further hints on avoiding some error settings.

I installed and tried the 2.4 version again as was suggested here, 
and I came to the conclusion pretty quickly there are several 
differences between the 2.4 and 2.5
Something that will need further review before I decide to swipe my 
installation on  live server and move all my users around.

So, I reinstalled 2.5 and it took no more than 2 hours before the 
first crash showed up in it's default installation with FTP turned 
off and access logging on.

Now I found an interesting article which could be further helpful in this.

I included a snippet about this below for those interested.

Also see the article on http://articles.networktechs.com/91-p1.php 
for details on how to turn off error reporting.

I have already done this since earlier but so far left critical 
errors as flagged / checked. NOw I am trying without this check mark 
to see if the dwwin.exe might be a culprit as well.

To some individuals further annoyance, I will post one more message 
in this series of topics on the Xitami crashes, and that is as soon I 
have had time to create the tool/utility I am now working on called 
xitamiKeepAlive. Release of this should be later today, Sunday, but 
I'll reserve myself against any bugs coming up along the way.


dwwin.exe Application Error

One of the biggest things being searched for on this site right now 
is dwwin.exe. The reason for this is because it displays during quite 
a few common fatal error messages.

First of all dwwin.exe is Dr Watson which is used by the error 
reporting tool. Alot of security related applications will throw up 
warning flags about this file trying to read, write or modify a 
number of other .exe files. This isn't anything to worry about 
because it's only trying to investigate "events" that it believes is 
causing problems that may lead to crashing.

File can be found:
*:windowssystem32dwwin.exe

The biggest complaint about the error reporting service is it causing 
alot of various applications to not load or crash during use. Quite a 
few of these can be fixed by downloading updates from windows update 
and scanning for viruses/spyware but alot of others simply won't be 
fixed with the currently available updates. In that case you'll want 
to just disable the service! After that 90% of the time the program 
will then run properly. I have been telling people to disable this 
service in quite a few of my guides.

Actually I had more issues with the 2.4 version than the 2.5 so I expect
that what ever was the problem was not addressed in the updated version. And
like Mike, this IS an urgent matter. I too only 12 sites and this tends to
happen at the most inopportune time when I can't get back to the server for
hours or days. But I've just gone almost a week with no problems.

OK. so I promised to release a little gadget that 
might help with the problem of
crashes being permanent and instead restore your Xitami process properly and
instantly, almost. This depends on the settings you chose in the application.

It is called xitamiKeepAlive (xiKA for short) and I uploaded it to my web site.

You can download it now and try it, but please know, I have only been able to
test it briefly on Windows XP since I have no 98, 95 or 200 machines here.
Also I don't use ME so I will not support that O/S

The zip file contains three files, xitamiKeepAlive.exe, xiKA.exe and the PDF
file with help and hints, FAQ and a lot more. Also a read-me file is included
pointing out the section H on page 9 in the PDF file as a vital read.

xitamiKeepAlive.exe is the GUI file to set it up 
and xiKA.exe is for the hidden sleeper processing.

It uses approx. 3.2 Mb RAM and 0.0% CPU while waiting to act.

The application will also allow you to specify regular reboot periods
for your server PC if you want to reset the machine completely.

If you guys want to send me feedback or test results, and perhaps let
me know if it works on your machine, the instructions for this are
included as well in the PDF file.

Please note! This application will only work on Windows and you must have
Visual Basic Runtime 6 SP 3 or higher installed.

And it is ONLY for Xitami 2.5c which has the xigui32.exe file.

My URL is http://www.mrjdesign.net/ and click the XITAMI link in the top menu.

If it doesn't work, it doesn't. But at least we will know, wont we :)
