&gt;<i>Hello !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I know port 119 is used for news.
</I>
If you know this, why are you using that port?  I made specific note of it
and suggested using a different port altogether...but that seems
unacceptable to you for some reason that I'd like to know.

&gt;<i>On any computer, if i type web.verfaillie.com:119 the connection can't be 
</I>&gt;<i>made, since the browser expects a NEWS response of some sort.
</I>&gt;<i>If i type <A HREF="http://web.verfaillie.com:119">http://web.verfaillie.com:119</A> the connection is made, because the 
</I>&gt;<i>browser expects a HTTP response.
</I>&gt;<i>The problem is the latest version of IE (the version you can download and 
</I>&gt;<i>that's included with XP).
</I>&gt;<i>It does tot allow http connections over a news port.
</I>
And I told you why.  HINTERNET is probably interfering and attempting a
NEWS connection.  HINTERNET is how IE communicates its desires for
information across the Internet.  Change the port number to some non-mapped
port that is not 21, 25, 80, 110, or 119 and your problems dealing with
HINTERNET will go away.

&gt;<i>It is not a problem with firewalls and ISP: when using a Netscape browser 
</I>&gt;<i>(on the same computer), the page can be retrieved.
</I>
Your assumption that, at the firewall level, packets are not affected is an
incorrect assumption.  Firewalls can and _DO_ interfere depending on
whether they are passive or not.  They can do anything from just blocking
packets of certain types to modifying the packet itself before delivering
it.  IE 6.0 (via HINTERNET) _could_ be sending out packets that are getting
dropped by your firewall for being ill-formed or redirecting them to the
wrong machine.  I just wanted to make sure I covered all the bases and made
you aware of the fact that your firewall could be the problem.

&gt;<i>For now i suggest users to use Netscape. For now the site is only for a 
</I>&gt;<i>limited user group.
</I>
Well, you will be continuing to limit your user group if you force them to
use older versions of IE or use Mozilla/Netscrape.

&gt;<i>I'm looking for some register fix to allow IE to connect.
</I>
This is probably the best way to lose users/customers...tell them they have
to modify the Windows registry to visit your site.

If I sound a bit upset, it is because:

1)  I gave several suggestions on how to fix the problem and you failed to
address those suggestions in your response.
2)  You attempted to rephrase your problem that I already completely
understood as if I didn't understand the problem completely.
3)  You seek an answer that will destroy your current and future customer
base.

The third reason is what I am most concerned about here.  You seem to have
no concern for your customers...and you will ultimately lose them as a
result.  If you don't deal with this issue properly, you will end up losing
even your most loyal customers.

Hope this helps!
