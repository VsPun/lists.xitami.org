<PRE>Hello,

I'm new to the list, so I'm jumping right in with a question for the group.

I have setup a virtual host through Xitami's WBA setup.  It seemed
relatively simple and when the process was complete I ended up with some
directories that corresponded with the virtual host name that I used.
However, I am at a loss as to how I am suppose to be able to access the
webpages and cgi files for this virtual host through a web browser.  I don't
know what I am suppose to use for a url.

My setup is a personal computer at home.  I am using Xitami to serve a make
believe online business web so that I can test cgi's that I have written. I
like to be as organized as possible, hence the reason for creating the
virtual host.  I want my project to have its own cgi-bin, webpages, etc
directories.  My Internet connection is through a cable modem, so the url
that I use to access the Xitami web server is through that IP address as
well as an internal address, 127.0.0.1.

I hope that I am making sense to someone out there.  If anyone can point me
in the right direction for setting up and accessing a virtual host via a web
browser, I would greatly appreciate the input.

Thanks
Bill
