 As you pointed out, only exe's get run, but the key to getting IIS to accept an exe is a little 16k dll that acts as a 'thunking' layer. The dll is named the same as its larger exe brother..call the dll in the script and the exe is run, which in turn returns the page. I realize now that this applies only for IIS. I had used o'Reilly in the distant past [ and may have to use it again ??] and it recognized the the .exe extension. Xitami appears to make a leap of faith that this is a script [ given the cg-bin in the tag ]

 What I've tried is to NOT use the dll extension and call the exe directly..but use just the file name instead. cgi-bin/MZload1 with no file extension. I get a blank page returned. Look on the bright side at least it found something this time out, and judging by the brief delay it looks as if something is being run.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks. File received, loaded and run succussfully.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  So I guess the issue isn't the mapping but some other setting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I attempted to run my dll [ which is uspposed to call the exe ].
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MZLOAD1.dll and I receive a windows warning 'You area
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attempting to open a file of type &quot;Application Extension&quot; dll '
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and suggests that running a file of this type may be harmful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc. Its as if its trying to download the dll instaed of running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it the same way IIS used to.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CGI runs executable files -- not DLLs. DLLs are not directly
</I>&gt;<i> executable. As the name infers, they are Dynamic Link
</I>&gt;<i> Libraries that are used by applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your DLL is likely an
</I>&gt;<i> ISAPI DLL designed to work with IIS. This has some performance
</I>&gt;<i> benefits since the DLL is loaded once by the IIS exe into
</I>&gt;<i> its memory space, whereas CGI exes must run-execute-close
</I>&gt;<i> each time they are needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Further, a CGI exe must
</I>&gt;<i> conform to the input/output requirements of CGI.
</I>&gt;<i> Try calling your exe directly.
