<PRE>&gt;<i> I have Drewhoo's home page at: sorcep.com/drewhoo/Drewhoo.html and
</I>&gt;<i> you CAN'T point drewhoo.com to that address from Domaincow's DNS
</I>&gt;<i> management!
</I>
Of course not. DNS is for machine-names, not sub-folders.

In DNS:
 sorcep.com -&gt; sorcep.com
 drewhoo.com -&gt; sorcep.com

DNS gets them to your machine. Then you tell XITAMI:

&quot;If they ask for sorcep.com, give them (webpages)/&quot;
&quot;If they ask for drewhoo.com, give them (webpages)/drewhoo&quot;
&quot;If they don't say what they want, give them (webpages)/&quot;

(That last case will happen with version 1 browsers, or if someone
types an IP number instead of a host-name. You can set IP numbered
V-hosts but it is rarely worth the trouble.)

Go into XITAMI's main Administration page, click &quot;Virtual hosts&quot;.
Click &quot;New&quot;.

Create virtual host profile:  [ drewhoo ]
Select IP address: [ (all) ]
Or, enter DNS host name:  [ drewhoo.com ]
Web page root directory:  drewhoo
Create directories if necessary?  [ ] (not checked)
Click &quot;Create&quot;

Since you already have the pages, I told you to NOT &quot;Create
directories&quot; so if you get the syntax wrong, Xitami will complain
and let you guess again.

The way you are set up now, (webpages)/drewhoo/ will pull up a
directory listing, unless you have an index.html in there. You
probably want to rename Drewhoo.html to index.html, so it will pop
up when drewhoo.com/ opens (webpages)/drewhoo/
