Hello Robert,

Welcome to the wonderful world of owning a webserver.  You want to look for
the IP netmask option in the Xitami configuration and add the offending IP
address to the list.  Restart Xitami and cross your fingers that the
setting takes hold.  The DoS can still carry on for a few minutes but
should subside as they realize nothing is happening.  You might also want
to consider turning the bandwidth restrictions on.

Robert,

You've been found!  Usually doesn't take long.

Another trick to defeat these things is change your working HTTP port from
80 to something other.  Since doing this, I've gotten ZERO DoS scans.  The
trick is to set up a CNAME for your domain and forward your web page to the
new port via this "alias".

Example:
Say I want my HTTP port to set at 450.  This is done as an offset setting in
defaults.cfg file.  Next, I set up CNAME with my DNS service (either at my
domain registrar (e.g.NetSol) or a DNS service (e.g. ZoneEdit)).  Last, I
forward
          www.mydomain.com
to
        ww2.mydomain.com:450/index.html.

and voila, no more DoS scanners.  I now only receive "legitimate" scans from
robot hunters and search engines.  And these folk are generally identifiable
in the logs.

The standard "48 to 72 hour" propagation delay will apply the first time you
do this due to the new "domain."  Forwarding changes are instantaneous.

If you use Virtual Domains, you will need to add the new ww2.mydomain.com to
your domain list.  Unless you want it to go someplace different, point it to
the same configuration file as www.mydomain.com.

Happy serving,
Charles

You can't _BLOCK_ ip ranges, you can only _ALLOW_ ranges (default=* : all 
allowed).

Isn't this done completely internally in Xitami when you change the 
portbase simply?

In other words, chaninging the port base would simply alter the port it 
sends the queries to,
but in the name servers you still only specify the IP number it should 
respond to.

This would have the same effect since the server would know to open 
everything at a certain port but not display this, doesn't it?

I have been running a small web site on Xitami for a few years, first
the console version and now the GUI. I would like to run it as a service
if possible, but I can't get it to go that way. The documentation hasn't
helped much. Running xisrv32.exe does not seem to do anything. I have
placed it and the Control Panel (xicpl32.cpl) in the Windows System32
folder, but although I can see and open the Xitami Control Panel,
nothing happens when I try to start it. The control panel shows its
status as suspended. I can launch any of the standard executables
(xitami.exe, xidos32.exe, and xigui32.exe) and the web server starts
right up. If any one out there has managed to run Xitami as a Windows
service, can you let me know what it is I need to do? I have not been
able to get it to work with either Windows 2000 or Windows XP. Thanks.

Message-ID: <000901c4da28$abe6e780$6501a80a@comcast.net>

Sort of.  Name servers don't allow you to change off of the standard port
(80).  They just point a shotgun at the IP and expect it to deal with
whatever comes its way.  Also, when you change an IP in a name server, it
takes the 24-72 hour propagation time to be usable.  Forwarding is instant
(nearly).

I use this analogy to get a handle on all of this.

Say, you have a private post office - your IP address.

As with everyone else at their own post office, you accept mail at PO Box 80
(standard HTTP port).  All your friends and friendly strangers write you
there.  This is also your default published address to the world (DNS
standard).  Occassionally (actually all the time) you open your mail box
(query) and get and process everything in it.  This, unfortunately, includes
the bulk mailers and scammers.

So you're tired of all that bulk garbage.  For that matter, it fills your
box so you can't get things you want.  So you tell your post master (Xitami)
to "shift" your mail box by 370.  Xitami adds 80 (the original) to this and
starts processing  mail for you at port 450 at the next work shift (reboot
of Xitami).  So dutifully you now query for your mail at box 450.  Box 80 is
physically still there but the clerk doesn't put anything in it, and mail
falls to the floor and it gets cleaned up by the bit bot (night crew).

The problem is that your friends still think your address is box 80.  That's
what your DNS server is telling them anyway and unless they know that your
address changed, their requests will end up on the floor, too.  This can be
handled in two ways:

    1.  Send your friends a change of address card.  "Hi.  I moved.  My old
address of www.me.com:80 (the actual default query for www.me.com) has been
changed to www.me.com:450 (or, heaven forbid 10.999.999.001:450).

    2.  Create a Canonical domain (CNAME) name say ww2.stillme.com and the
have your DNS service forward any web queries to www.me.com to
ww2.stillme.com:450/default.htm.  Masking optional.

The second method allows you to instantly change PO boxes on a whim,
changing the forwarding, and no one is the wiser.  I've done both and the
second is definitely preferred.  It is akin to setting up mail.me.com or
ftp.me.com and processing the query by content.

I'm actually starting to see more web sites doing this forward trick.
Probably to diminish/eliminate the same things you want to
diminish/eliminate.

caveat:
1. port shifting will also shift the FTP port.  I don't use Xitami's FTP so
I don't care.
2. When you "open" a page in IE (and others), they don't understand a query
that has a port number added on.  They make you address with "HTTP://"

Simple is good!  Hope this has been helpful, if not amusing.
Charles

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to =
figure
out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you figure =
out
what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami
2. In the \xitami\win32 folder, copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory. Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type "cd\xitami" to change to the xitami
directory. Then type "xisrv32.exe -i" to install the service. The =
service is
now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run "xisrv32.exe -u".

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into =
services
and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and start it =
there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you =
may
need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with an
account that has access.

Thank to all for their answers
The idiots were in another departement of "my" university (they want to
kickout the site..)
the "incrimineted" site was  the site behind the graphic "Jean Louis" at
jean.kgw.tu-berlin.de
And in my opinion this fact (to obstruct a satire) is in summa a good

Okay, looking for the LAST word.

Windows 98SE and xisrv32.exe - can it be made to work?

Thanks,
Charles

config:
Xitami 2.5c2 (xidos32.exe called in STARTUP); Win98SE on P166 old timer with
256MB.
Other stuff: Fictional Daemon FTP, Mercury Mail, PHP, MySQL, ZoneAlarm, AVG.
No partridges or pears.
All seems to play well together and its been 55 days since last reboot.

BTW: latest version of Xitami has defeated a wierd "smthttp: error on socket
160" error I kept getting previously.  Yeah!  Don't know what it means.
Glad it's gone.  error <=> bad!

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to figure
out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you figure out
what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami
2. In the \xitami\win32 folder, copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory. Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type "cd\xitami" to change to the xitami
directory. Then type "xisrv32.exe -i" to install the service. The service is
now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run "xisrv32.exe -u".

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into services
and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and start it there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you may
need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with an
account that has access.

Natively, no. There might be some third party software out there that =
added
services capability to Windows 9x. If so, I'm not aware of it and it
probably isn't very stable or resource friendly. I think apache =
experimented
with making a 9x service but not sure how it turned out.

This says it all, make sure the XP abomination of a firewall can or will

 While I would agree that SP2 does introduce a lot of fixes so that
people will be safe from themselves, I would not recommend dumping it.
In addition to the point and drool enhancements, there are a lot of
security fixes included.  If you are gonna use XP, you need to make sure
your security patches are up to date.  Much better to either turn off
what you don't need (does not take that long) or make sure you apply all
the individual patches that apply.

Windows XP SP2 enables by default Microsoft's feeble attempt at a
firewall.  Have you turned off Windows built in  firewall for your LAN
connection to which Xitami is attached?

I apologize for my previous too long e-mail.

I ''ve installed Xitami 2.4d10 on my Windows XP SP1 PC. Until now
everything works well. Having upgrade XP with SP2 now I've got Xitami
service failed to start. Did anynone have any suggestion to solve this
problem ? To help understading the problem I've attached some log and
config files from my Xitami installation.

I have just tried to disable MS Internet firewall not only on the network=

connection on
with Xitami  is binded but for all the network and xitami does'nt work an=
yway.
I hope to properly have made all the needed operation for disabling the
firewall and then 
did you know if exist any xitami patches for bypassing this problem ?

Thanks

Says the oh-so-savvy computer user that:
    1) top-posts an answer above the original quoted material;
    2) does do in both plain ASCII *and* HTML, when the original poster
    at least had had the courtesy of eliminating *that* particular
    Microsoft abomination;
    3) Has the temerity to include a binary:

    background to the latter post.
    
I would suggest removing the beam from thine own eye.

Moreover, with what are you suggesting that the inquirer replace XP/SP2?

Surely he is unable to make the transition to a real[1] operating system
all that easily?  Or were you suggesting removal of the SP2 fix-pack?  If
he did this, his system would be vulnerable (read: FAR FAR MORE
vulnerable than it is at present) to any of the many exploits
circulating.  Are you unaware that a vanilla-installation of XP cannot be
connected to the Internet for more than a few minutes (under ten, and a
few seconds in some environments) without being exploited by many of the
viral worms circulating?  At least having SP2 present avoids a lot of
that infestation.

[1] OTOH, if the original poster is prepared to ditch Windoze, then
eComStation <http://www.ecomstation.com/> provides a viable alternative,
that is totally unaffected by any anti-Windows malware.  Xitami runs
under this (use the OS/2 version).

I use SP2 across the board and without problems and SP2 actually has
enhanced wireless support - my laptop runs much better with it than what it
did with SP1.

Not that I run a web server over wireless or anything :P

I, of course, have turned everything "security-wise" off (firewall, some
parts of automatic updates, auto-detection of anti-virus software, and the
tool that annoyingly decides how to secure my own PC that resides behind
two heavily guarded routers/firewalls).

Also, between the new built-in IE6 popup blocker AND the Google toolbar, I
don't see any more popups (Google's toy was starting to fail when the IE6
blocker came out).  What the IE6 blocker misses, the Google toolbar
catches.  The only thing left that unfortunately still works are the DHTML
ads that "pop-up" on some webpages to obstruct my view.  I understand why
they aren't caught since they are a part of the webpage and to stop those
would also mean stopping drop-down menus from showing up.

Also, as Craig mentioned, SP2 comes with a junkload of security fixes and
rollups.  The SP2 package was delayed forever because corporate users kept
finding problems.  The SP2 Beta was interesting because it included debug
trace builds of core OS components - each one contained developer contact
information (names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses).  I'm sure that during
that time, developers got a lot of calls from outsiders when bugs were
encountered.

So, SP2 is for everyone who wants to secure their PC.  Disable the Windows
firewall, put a real hardware firewall (e.g. a router) between you and the
Internet and everything should work great.

See my recent post below and the response from Steve Winn. It worked
perfectly for me, although I am using the standard version, not Xitami
Pro. Xitami 2.5c2.

Subject: RE: [Xitami] Installing Xitami as a service

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to
figure out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you
figure out what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami 2. In the \xitami\win32 folder,
copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory. Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type "cd\xitami" to change to the xitami
directory. Then type "xisrv32.exe -i" to install the service. The
service is now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run "xisrv32.exe -u".

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into
services and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and
start it there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you
may need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with
an account that has access.

Hello,

        I changed my default1 entry to point to index.shtml which is as follows;
<html>
<head>
<title>OUR FAMILY</title>
</head>

<body Text=#ffffff bgcolor="#000000">
<CENTER>
<BR><BR><BR>

<MARQUEE>This page is under construction.</MARQUEE>
</H1>
<BR><BR><BR>
<!--#INCLUDE VIRTUAL="cgi-bin/time.pl"-->
</CENTER>
</body>
</HTML>


</html>

I placed my perl in cgi-bin time.pl it looks as follows;
#! /usr/bin/perl

$ENV{"TZ"} = "EST5EDT";
($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) = localtime(time);
if ($hour >  12)
{
 $hour = $hour - 12;
 $ind = "PM";
}
elsif ($hour == 12)
{
 $ind = "PM";
}
elsif ($hour == 0)
{
 $hour = 12;
 $ind = "AM";
}
else
{
 $ind = "AM";
}
$day=(Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday)[$wday];
$month=(January,February,March,April,May,June,July,August,September,October,November,December)[$mon];
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
printf ("%s %s %02d %4d, %02d:%02d %2s", $day, $month, $mday, (1900+$year), $hour, $min, $ind);

exit 0;

The problem is when  I attempt to open the page as localhost the system seems to hang for a long period of time I don't know what is wrong if anyone could tell me what's wrong I'd really appreciate it. I run the same shtml doc and cgi on a apache web server and it works perfect. Any help would really be appreciated.
I am running on WinXPHome  xitami-25 version as a service(xisrv32.exe);

Thank You,

Stephen S. Disbrow

Subject: [Xitami] FTP and XP Pro Security Set Up
Message-ID: <20041227095053.D6BD03DF0@xprdmailfe8.nwk.excite.com>

I have been running Xitami since 1999 and I have had great success on windows 98, SE, ME, 2000, and XP pro until now.
Currently I am running XP pro and Xitami v2.4d10 

I have set up users and passwords pointing to individual directories in my ftproot. I had this running very well pre SP2 and there were no problems.  I'm not sure what happened.  I have since reinstalled XP pro with only SP1.  I am still experiencing the same problem.  My ISP (an educational institution) had poked holes in the firewall back in 1999 for http and ftp for my IP address.  I checked with them and nothing has changed.  
FTP works in house, but not outside the LAN.

So what might be at issue here?
How do I set up security permissions in XP pro for Xitami?
Do I have to set up set up "matching" user accounts in XP pro to allow users access to their directories?  How do I set up file permissions in XP pro folders?

I had done this in the past and it worked with matching user names and passwords.  But now things are not.  Help......

Same as previous messages have pointed out in here.
SP 2 has the bad habbit of installing a default firewall that will decide by
itself to close anything and everything out.

I know of no sure way to uninstall SP 2 to make it work or disable it since
I shunned the SP2 and dont use XP for server hosting.

The only thing I know I had to do was to re-install my entire box and
reinstall without SP2 to make it work with all my apps again.

Message-ID: <41D2ECD3.9040508@gmail.com>

When I boot up, Xitami tries to start but keeps failing.  If I close the 
inetinfo process in windows XP (sometimes I have to close it once, and 
sometimes 100 times in a row) it will eventually load.  I don't know 
what the heck is going on here.  Can anyone help?

Isn't INETINFO a part of IIS?

Your IIS would take over port 80 if installed and you need ot exit it before
being able to run Xitami on port 80.

Disable IIS and you should be able to run it.

I may be wrong so please excuse any erroneous info.

You can run windows IIS on a different port if you need ASP. I run my Xitami
on 80 and ISS on 85 for the same directories.

What is IIS or ISS?  I saw both of those things quoted here... how would 
I disable it, and how would I change it's port?  Most importantly, what 
does it do, so I know if I should disable or reroute.  Thanks for the 
help folks!

IIS is Internet Information Services
The integrated web server that comes with XP and NT based O/S from Windows.
The IIS verision on XP and W2K is no. 5 and W2K3 is IIS 6.
They work slightly different.

You need to

right click the my computer icon on your desktop
Select MANAGE
Click Services And Applications
Select the Services Icon on the left hand side..

Look for the listing IIS Admin Service
Right click it in the right hand screen.
Select PROPERTIES
Under startup type, select DISABLED instead of AUTOMATIC
Click STOP
Click OK

That should do it.

Well, AVG scans any file that gets opened either for reading or writing for
viruses.  I never have had a problem with Xitami slowing down.

What AVG probably does is hook the CreateFile() API using a global hooking
mechanism (DLL).  If it leaks resources while handling the hook, it could
slow down the whole system, but not just one application.  Disabling AVG
won't remove the hook DLL.  Those things can be difficult to downright
impossible to remove.

Thomas,

I've been running AVG for over a year and it is not the problem, there is
something else going on. I'll keep stabbing away at it and see what I can
figure out. I know that there are some new viruses out there that may not be
in the virus definitions yet. One in particular infects phpBB and may infect
other php sites. I'm not running phpBB though.

Ron

  I placed my perl in cgi-bin time.pl it looks as follows;

If you're running PHP I suggest upgrading that to latest set.
We just had another site go offline becuase someone infected and took over
SMTP on a server with PHP and a basic forum.
If you run volic forum you should get their latest patch for this as well
and upgrade your MySQL files.

Apparently the system can be taken over and start running smtp bulk mailing
from infected machines.
Not sure if it applies to your system but worth a checkup/notice.

Haven't experienced slow downs since installed latest Xitami (2.5c2 on
dedicated Win98SE box).  Used to have problems after 6-8 weeks of up time.
Had this strange "smthttp: error on socket160"  error that also went away
with the update.  Re-boot, of course, fixed everything.

Which version of AVG are you running?  They quit support for V 6.0 today to
switch to version 7.  Today's V6 update requires a reboot which will mess up
my "been up since" 10/7 record.  Oh well maybe tomorrow - New Years and all.

Happy Merry,
Charles

The problem wasn't Xitami at all, it was the drive I had Xitami on, it was
corrupt. I did a repair of the drive and all is good now. Now the next
question, what caused the corruption? If I figure it out I will report back
with my findings.

I've been running AVG for over a year and it is not the problem, there is
something else going on. I'll keep stabbing away at it and see what I can

Well, AVG scans any file that gets opened either for reading or writing for
viruses.  I never have had a problem with Xitami slowing down.

What AVG probably does is hook the CreateFile() API using a global hooking
mechanism (DLL).  If it leaks resources while handling the hook, it could
slow down the whole system, but not just one application.  Disabling AVG
won't remove the hook DLL.  Those things can be difficult to downright
impossible to remove.

If you're running PHP I suggest upgrading that to latest set.
We just had another site go offline becuase someone infected and took over
SMTP on a server with PHP and a basic forum.
If you run volic forum you should get their latest patch for this as well
and upgrade your MySQL files.

Apparently the system can be taken over and start running smtp bulk mailing
from infected machines.
Not sure if it applies to your system but worth a checkup/notice.

The problem wasn't Xitami at all, it was the drive I had Xitami on, it
was
corrupt. I did a repair of the drive and all is good now. Now the next
question, what caused the corruption? If I figure it out I will report
back
with my findings.

Thomas,

I've been running AVG for over a year and it is not the problem, there
is
something else going on. I'll keep stabbing away at it and see what I
can
figure out. I know that there are some new viruses out there that may
not be
in the virus definitions yet. One in particular infects phpBB and may
infect
other php sites. I'm not running phpBB though.

Ron

Well, AVG scans any file that gets opened either for reading or writing
for
viruses.  I never have had a problem with Xitami slowing down.

What AVG probably does is hook the CreateFile() API using a global
hooking
mechanism (DLL).  If it leaks resources while handling the hook, it
could
slow down the whole system, but not just one application.  Disabling AVG
won't remove the hook DLL.  Those things can be difficult to downright
impossible to remove.
