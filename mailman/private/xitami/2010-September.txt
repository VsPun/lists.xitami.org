Hi,

This bug was mentioned on this list around the time that it was first
identified:

http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/2001-December/001716.html
http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/2002-March/002726.html

Perhaps it is related to Opera's reported problems with Xitami:

http://www.saunalahti.fi/~tapio18/////////Teaching/SelainsuosituksetSpeed.php3

Any chance the developers know if & when this was fixed?

Was it found to only affect Windows 2000?

Is it likely that this problem is still out in the wild?
The securityspace isn't very helpful to work that out. ;-)

Also, the git hub link on xitami.com needs to be updated.

To Pieter (or anyone who might know)

In searching for a solution to an issue I was having, I found a 1 Dec 2009
post on Wikidot which indicated that if a DOCTYPE line was present that
Xitami would not respect the formatting in the CSS file.  I am having the
same issue with both Safari and Chrome.  Pieter had suggested that this was
a "pure HTML" issue and encouraged the poster to ask the question in this
forum but I don't see that he ever did.

In anyone's experience, is there a DOCTYPE that will work with Xitami
(V2.4d6) on Safari and Chrome?  Or is there otherwise a solution?

Thanks

Phil
