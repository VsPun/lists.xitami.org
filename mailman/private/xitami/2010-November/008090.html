<PRE>I saw this same response on welovecss.com
www.welovecss.com/showthread.php?t=4075 when I was searching for an answer
to this issue.  I wasn't sure if the poster, meesa, was saying that they
never heard of Xitami or that they never heard of the problem.  Was that
you?

The problem for me is that my version of Xitami 2.4d6, the version that I
have used for 9+ years without a problem, with the new Chrome 6 only appears
to work properly with DOCTYPE of &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; - anything more in the angle
brackets and the page doesn't respect the CSS.  Weird.  I agree that it is a
Xitami issue.  Previously, for some reason, a &lt;!DOCTYPE ... /&gt; of anything
in the brackets but ending in a '/&gt;' worked for all browsers but never
passed the validator.w3.org test wit it like that - but it worked.

When I posted this a few weeks ago, I was asking whether anyone else had
experienced this but yours was the only response so I made the issue a bit
clearer above and again ask for comment.

Thank you.

  Looks like Xitami is the one with the problem here. I wouldn't worry about
it though. I've personally never even heard of it before, thus, it isn't
very popular.
