<PRE>Gordon,

This did NOT work for me.  I added the line in the defaults.cfg with a
&quot;normal&quot; DOCTYPE and page was wacky.  Tried restarting Xitami.  No change.
Tried adding line to MIME section of xitami.cfg with and without a restart -
no difference.  For me the only thing that works is using a DOCTYPE of
&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;

Would you mind giving me the page address that now works for you.  I'd like
to see what you have in your CSS. Thanks.

Phil

Whoops - found the solution.  Now Chrome works with external stylesheets.

Edit defaults.cfg and add the two lines:

[Mime]
     css=text/css

I didn't even have to restart Xitami.

I said:
I have been having unreliable results with external stylesheets with Xitami
2.4d10 under Windows with Chrome browser.
The same test site that fails with Chrome browser when served by Xitami
works fine with Apache.
I tried everything to do with DTD and @charset etc.
Unless someone can identify why Xitami does this it's time to move on ...
