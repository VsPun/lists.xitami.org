Subject: [Xitami] can't turn off computer after running xigui32.exe
Message-ID: <BAY13-F216140F11983D8CC83E56181B50@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I am using a windows tablet PC (Toshiba M200) and Xitami 2.5c2.  I am having 
a slight problem.  Initially I start xitami by running xigui32.exe.  That 
opens up a small icon in the windows tray.  I then start a computerized 
questionnaire I programmed for collecting some hospital data using microsoft 
internet explorer.  When I am done running the questionnaire, I close 
internet explorer and right click on the xitami icon to shut it down.  But 
here's where the problem starts, even after terminating xitami, I can't shut 
down or log off windows.  When click "start --> shutdown" the screen 
flashes, and I am still logged in.

Any suggestions?
thanks,
Dan

Hey,
I've noticed that, from time to time, Xitami will lock up (port 80
will close) and I'll have to kill/restart it by hand.  While I place
the blame for this soly on the unholy mess of Perl scripts that it is
serving, I'd like to know if there are any facilities Xitami provides
to debug these lockups.  I've tried using the "debug" flag in the
config file, but it does not seem to provide any useful information.
Alternately, if there was a better way to kill/restart Xitami when it
goes down, it would be nice to know about... Right now I've just got a
script that queries the server every 30 seconds, and if the query
fails it kills/restarts it (which is neither terribly clean or
effective).
Thanks for the help,
David

i'm likely way off base with this one...

but is it possible that you may have another application running on that
machine (like a messenger client), that opens and steals port 80 away from
xitami?

My problem was that xitami would not let go of some connections, and they 
would pile up and cause a lockup or crash every couple of days. I am using 
it on a PC with XP Pro, and my solution was to make xitami a service, then 
use the "scheduled tasks" feature to stop and start the service each morning 
about 3:45 AM...... Haven't had any problems at all since setting it up this 
way, and I also run a ton of perl scripts on 5 domains using a DSL line.
I am even running two instances of xitami, using the second one to reset the 
main one when a new password is added for a "protected folder" area. This is 
needed because Xitami's "refresh" doesn't seem to work in the newer versions

Ah, this seems like it could be it!
I'll give it a try.
Thanks,

Subject: [Xitami] problem building Xitami on Linux
Message-ID: <620142177.1148555146@[192.168.2.170]>


I'm attempting to build Xitami under Linux, but am having a problem.  The 
file 'c' appears to be missing from the tar of both the 2.4 and 2.5 
releases.

Is this an oversight, or is there something I just don't know...

Thanks, David Buckley.

I had the same problem and just like you tracked it to missing 'c'  I asked
and
the reply i was given from this list (and the solution did work) is just
below:

---quote---
Xitami uses a number of components from other iMatix packages to build.  The
'c' script being the one you need to compile (others are used when modifying
the source code).

The simplest solution is to download the Base package from http://
www.imatix.net/pub and extract the 'c' script you'll find in base/boom.
Place this on the path somewhere.

Alternatively you can build the full Base package, after which Xitami will
be
happy to compile.

I'm sorry for the broken Xitami source package.  I'll get around to fixing
it,
one day.

---end quote---

Hope this helps
