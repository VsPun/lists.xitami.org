<PRE>&gt;<i> Is a static ip necessary? I use TZO
</I>
Nice but not necessary. Using TZO to associate your name address to your
hopping IP number will give momentary glitches, but works well for many
people. 

In particular: if someone hits right after your IP number changes, they won't
connect until TZO gets updated. Since you say &quot;checks it once a minute&quot;, that
should never leave you invisible for long.

A bigger issue, and I am not sure how this works, is that various ISPs may
cache DNS records on their own DNS servers rather than keep going to a DNS
server in authority. That's standard practice, the authoritative DNS record
can give a suggested time of updating, and I suppose TZO must be setting their
update suggestion shorter than a DNS system full of hard-wired &quot;permanent IP&quot;
machines like mine. But other ISP DNS servers are free to ignore it, and use
cached DNS records as long as they want. 

&gt;<i>  Ping and tracert 
</I>
By name, I assume. What happens if you call them on the phone, tell them the
IP number you are on at that moment, and they ping that number? i.e. is it a
DNS issue or is your IP number just not reachable? 

FWIW: ping 66.32.68.16 at 7:10 PM EST fails for me; tracert stops tracking
after three hops inside MindSpring. Omitting known route through my campus
routers and my usual ALTER.NET backbone routers:
