<PRE>I know that is what I said but it wasn't what I meant. Yeah that is true dns
has nothing to do with ports and you know now that I think about it I don't
have port 8080 turned on for forwarding on the router. Sometimes one misses
the obvious. Give it a try now.

Your confusion is understood, I was there once myself. DNS has nothing to do
with ports, it only serves to translate a name to an IP address. Your router
takes care of port forwarding and translating between external and internal
IP
addresses.

With that in mind, open up port 8080 on your router and have it forwarded to
192.168.1.3. Make sure that webcam.ackerman-family.com points to your
_external_ IP (which it does, nslookup reports that).

Then use one of the redirection techniques that have been suggested on the
list. The following type of redirection will be supported by most modern
browsers (and doesn't require JavaScript):

&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT=&quot;0;
URL=<A HREF="http://webcam.ackerman-family.com:8080/"">http://webcam.ackerman-family.com:8080/&quot;</A>&gt;

Just make sure you place it in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML document.

To get to the document, all depends on whether you have virtual domains
setup
or not.

If you don't, you just need to create an HTML document with the above in it
and place it in your webpages folder. Which means you'll need a link of some
kind on another page to get to it.

Personally what I would do is put the above in a basic HTML document and
save
it as index.html in a folder off the webpages folder, say 'webcam'. So you
would end up with:

\xitami\webpages\webcam

Which could be used as the [Server]webpages entry in the cfg file for a
virtual domain.

Does that help any?
