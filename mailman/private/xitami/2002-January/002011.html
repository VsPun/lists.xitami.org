<PRE>I am not sure that the problem is not much more simple than everyone has
made it, as it has been a couple of days since the original post, and I am
able to connect just fine.  I have had similar problems as I have had other
companies host my sites up until recently.  In trying to find a good
provider, I often moved my site.

I found DNS updating to be a long and slow process.  It always seemed that
within  2 days or so of pointing my Domain at a host IP, half of the
internet could connect to my site, and half couldn't.  It often took more
than 2 weeks before I could trace route my site from servers everwhere (you
can do this at www.tracert.com).

If you have just recently set up your server, and pointed your domain at
your dynamic ISP service, be patient.  I know its very frustrating.  Within
a couple of weeks everyone will probably be able to connect to your site.

Good Luck,

Jay Aldrich
