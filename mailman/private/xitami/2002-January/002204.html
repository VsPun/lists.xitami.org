</I>&gt;<i>Win98, I don't know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Let me explain my setup and when the problem occurs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The server I'm running xitami on has two network-cards. Basicly the
</I>&gt;<i>setup is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Internet  --CableModem  ---- Server(NIC1)
</I>&gt;<i>                        ---- Server(NIC2) ----- LAN
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, the server has two NICs, one for the 'outside' and the other for
</I>&gt;<i>the Lan. The server runs Win98 and serves my homepage with Xitami.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>People on the LAN can do anything they want on the internet because
</I>&gt;<i>the server is also running Sygate software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now  the  problem is that everytime someone on the LAN connects to the
</I>&gt;<i>homepage (either on the local or external ip-address), the
</I>&gt;<i>internet-connection is lost! After about 30 seconds, the
</I>&gt;<i>internet-connection to the outside is back again. Pretty strange
</I>&gt;<i>right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Could this be due to:
</I>&gt;<i>a) The workings of Xitami?
</I>&gt;<i>b) The OS; Win98?
</I>&gt;<i>c) Sygate?
</I>&gt;<i>d) Something funny the ISP has done to the CableModem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>For the record: with 'External' I mean that via the LAN people connect
</I>&gt;<i>to the homepage on the NIC1 IP-address instead of NIC2.
</I>&gt;<i>(So, NIC2 having the local 192.168.0.1 address).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Suggestions thta the problem is Sygate and/or Win98 seem likely to be 
correct.

I reformatted the HD of my gateway machine and installed smoothwall 
(www.smoothwall.org) and then was a vrey naughty boy and installed 
Xitami on the internal LAN port precisesly what Smoothwall doesn't want 
you to do. It works a treat!
