<PRE>Thanks. Why would the redirects bother some and not others? The two on
roadrunner have the exact same setup but one can hit and the other can't.
(same computer, same everything) I don't want to get a static ip address
unless I know it is the fix for my problem. I'm inclined to think it is
something on my end but I could be wrong. That is why I am using this avenue
to see.

No, I turn all the power saving features off. I only have a screen saver.

It's only on this computer because it is the only one I have at the moment.
I do want to get a dedicated one but I need to work through these issues
first. I have plans of hosting another virtual site and want to get the
kinks out first.

   The simple fact is, the fewer redirects you have, the better.

One other thought occurred to me. Do you have power saving
features turned on? If you do, you might wanna turn them off.
My experience, and the experience of others is that all they do
is get in the way.

   Like the other person says, it sounds like you have multiple
problems.

   Also, if your server isn't dedicated, you might wanna make
it so. Strip it down software wise, don't put anything on it
that isn't necessary for WEB management.

   Xitami is fast, there is NO reason to use such a powerful
machine as you describe. It's a waste really,  all you really
need for top performance is any computer capable of
handling a PCI NIC. I run mine on a 586 dx4 100, it just putts
along in my backroom. I then use another computer for my
personal use.

Hope this helps..

ITL, Bruce
