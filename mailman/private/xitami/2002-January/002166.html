<PRE>Melle,

My gut reaction here is that Sygate is the &quot;problem.&quot; I have a lot of
experience with Sygate AND Xitami on a Win98 box. Whenever I use Sygate as a
NAT (connection sharer), any servers (software daemons, and not just Xitami)
run in that machine act strangely ONLY when you try to access them from a
LOCAL machine.

What I THINK is happeneing here is that Sygate is tring to redirect the
incoming request out to the Internet, but only after some time passes does
it figure out that the request is actually intended for ITSELF, and then let
it through. In so figuring out what to do, Sygate sort of goes beserk for a
little bit, and fails as a NAT until it regains its composure.

There are plenty of solutions. Personally, for the home office, I have been
using a Linksys DSL-Router for NAT duties. It is much more stable than
sygate, more flexible for port forwarding, and it never requires rebooting
;-). With Sygate off of your Win98 server, it can be free to run Xitami
quite happily. Just tell the Router to forward port 80 (and port 21, if
using FTP also) to the Xitami machine.

I have a Win98 machine running Xitami, a separate FTP server, a mail server
(pop and SMTP), a remote access server (sort of like PC Anywhere), plus it
serves out a laser printer to the LAN and provides a shared Windows hard
drive. I restart it every 80 days just out of habit. Though it is not being
slammed by hundreds of users daily, serving speed is NOT an issue, nor is
stability. And this is a Pentium 133 with around 80 megs of ram I'm talking
about here.

My point here is to say that Win98 can be fine for your server if there
aren't dozens of concurrent users slamming it.

&gt;<i> I've got another problem with Xitami, or at least: I think Xitami may
</I>&gt;<i> be causing some troubles. But maybe it's due to TCP stack troubles on
</I>&gt;<i> Win98, I don't know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me explain my setup and when the problem occurs:

....


&gt;<i> Could this be due to:
</I>&gt;<i> a) The workings of Xitami?
</I>&gt;<i> b) The OS; Win98?
</I>&gt;<i> c) Sygate?
</I>&gt;<i> d) Something funny the ISP has done to the CableModem?
