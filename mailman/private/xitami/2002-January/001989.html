Forgive my ignorance Gunner, I'm a veteran C++ / Database &amp; embedded systems
programmer but I've only been doing web programming (mostly with php) for about
12 months. I'd like to know more about robots, what they can do, their
architecture &amp; implimentation. Are there any web refererences you can give me
that explain more ???

By removing any and all forms from the VB project and using modules and classes
... you can get an EXE down to 28 - 32k that loads in a flash.

Yes, the VB virtual machine must also load. There are tools that allow you to
keep these DLL's in memory, along with ADO.

This will provide even better response.

I only prefer VB because I've been programming in it for years. Of course ...
there are other solutions, and VB is a Windows solution.

I'm not a MS freak, quite the contrary. I do Front end work in Shockwave. But
for back end work, VB on an NT machine
running Xitami is quite nice.

Furthermore, I use VB and Director Shockwave EXE's as robots to read incoming
emails.

I only use CGI for 'insecure' stuff ... stuff I don't care who sees.  For
security, I encrypt emails and have robots read and decrypt the email content.

Very nice, all works quite well on the same server.  A 166 mhz Cyrix !

As I get bigger, I will put email server on another box, mySQL on another box
and yet another box for the robots to execute.

ps. NT must be secured. Out the box it's insecure.
