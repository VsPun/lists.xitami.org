</I>I just tried to access your site using wget (a CLI program to get 
webpages). Got some interesting results, whihc also partially appear in 
my browser (Mozilla).

First a default page which gets redirected to index.html (ignore the .1 
thats caused by the fact I had an index.html in the wget diretory)

C:\temp\wget&gt;wget <A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/">http://www.hanleytime.com/</A>
--15:24:41--  <A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/">http://www.hanleytime.com/</A>
           =&gt; `index.html.1'
Connecting to www.hanleytime.com:80... connected!
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 1,979 [text/html]

    0K                                                         0% @   
0.00 B/s

15:27:38 (0.00 B/s) - Read error at byte 0/1979 (No such file or 
directory). Ret
rying.
..
^C

Now an attempt to get a non existant page - standard Xitami error returned

C:\temp\wget&gt;wget <A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/index1.html">http://www.hanleytime.com/index1.html</A>
--15:27:59--  <A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/index1.html">http://www.hanleytime.com/index1.html</A>
           =&gt; `index1.html'
Connecting to www.hanleytime.com:80... connected!
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found
15:27:59 ERROR 404: Not Found.

Now an attempt to get a page that exists but with no redirect.
C:\temp\wget&gt;wget <A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/index.html">http://www.hanleytime.com/index.html</A>
--15:28:03--  <A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/index.html">http://www.hanleytime.com/index.html</A>
           =&gt; `index.html.2'

HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

0.00 B/s

15:28:07 (0.00 B/s) - Read error at byte 0/1979 (No such file or 
directory). Ret
rying.

On the other hand even my browser can download 
<A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/images/">http://www.hanleytime.com/images/</A> and get a webpage with the contents of 
your images subdirectory AND I can also download and view 
<A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/images/buttons.gif">http://www.hanleytime.com/images/buttons.gif</A> so it looks like the 
problem is somehow related to .html pages.

Using a really basic perl script that uses IO::Socket, what happens is 
that the socket gets closed abruptly after the header is sent. This 
looks like a OS problem where Xitami is for some reason not able to open 
the file to read it because the error pages are correctly downloaded 
although I suppose it could be a router problem. Given that I can 
download images though I'm really confused

I probably of limited use for testing since I have to go through a proxy 
or 2 to get on the internet so its hard for me to tell exactly what is 
going on...

PS late breaking news. I just tried to download a different image 
(<A HREF="http://www.hanleytime.com/images/xitami1.gif">http://www.hanleytime.com/images/xitami1.gif</A>) and it has stalled.
