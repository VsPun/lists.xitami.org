Doh!

PASV (and all those other &quot;four-letter&quot; commands, like USER) are the
commands used over the sockets connection between the FTP client and the
FTP server.  Few FTP clients will accept such commands at their user CLI.
These commands are what actually /constitute/ the protocol itself.

Some FTP clients will recognize a QUOTE command, which can push a
complete File Transfer Protocol (guess why I wrote that in full) command
over to the server for execution.

Anyway, the long and short of it is that to take advantage of an FTP
server, like Xitami, which supports &quot;passive FTP&quot; requires that you have
a client that utilizes passive FTP.  

I don't know, for instance, whether the command-line client included in
Windoze uses it: that code (as can be seen by extracting the Copyright
string from the executable) is based upon old BSD code of 1983 vintage.
Is that what you were using above, generating the &quot;ftp&gt; &quot; prompt?
