Well he was a grad student :-)  (At least in the early 1980s when FTP
was first being invented; the later RFCs/standards simply consolidated
things somewhat.)

Some of the generality of FTP was useful once (such as translating from
old IBM mainframes to ASCII based systems and such like), but much of it
has outlived its usefulness.  That combined with the fact that FTP and
firewalls badly disagree with each other means that I'd be pretty happy
to see FTP go away for good.
