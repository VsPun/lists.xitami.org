Subject: [Xitami] cgi-bin directory
Message-ID: <000e01c7f1cb$848c97d0$6501a8c0@tp2>

Hi all,

When someone tries to get a file that resides in my cgi-bin directories that is not a .cgi or .pl file, it is downloaded to the browser. I have several virtual hosts under the webpages directory and thier individual cgi-bin dirs below them.

I searched for parms in the conf files that might be related but I am stumped!
Any ideas how to remedy this?

Randie

In your config file:
[CGI]
   mixed-url = 0

and restart the server

Hi,
What could cause memtrace.lst to grow to be very large? By large I mean
over a Gig. These systems are used with an LRWP application of ours.
Only one site in about 80 is doing this. For the rest, memtrace.lst
remains small.

This is in version 2.4d9
Thanks,
Brian

Memory leak, in some component written using the SFL library, so
either the web server, the LRWP agent, or the application if written
in C/SFL.

Can logging to memtrace.lst be turned off so it doesn't fill up the hard
drive?

Our LRWP application is written in C and uses the SFL.

Rather than switch it off, you should fix the memory leak - it looks
like a problem in your LRWP application.  It's quite simple - the
first page of the memtrace.lst file will show the file and line number
of the allocation.  (If you don't see this, rebuild with -DDEBUG).

If you don't fix the leak, the application will eventually kill the
machine in any case.

 Is there any way to beautify the Xitmai directory lists? I have found the

 file type listed in the directory. That is, a custom mini image for rar, zip, gig,

hi simon,

i've beautified my directory lists extensively. i will send you my set of
custom icons off-list, and let you help yourself, if you please.

corresponding icons are simple... it's all in the naming "dirzip.gif" (for
zip-file icons), dirtxt.gif, dirhtml.gif, etc... and they all just magically
fall into place  :)

Thanks a lot, much appreciated. Icons received :-)

Yeah,  I thought that was supposed to be the case. Obviously something amiss
with  my  set  up  somewhere  as  the  naming  convention I used seems to be
correct;  it's  just  that  the  default  question  mark  image displays for
everything in my lists rather than the corresponding image.

I'll have to go back and try and work out what's going on/wrong.

Well  they  do  now  :-)  Strange, never had a duff Xitami setup before. All
fixed  now  though.  Thanks  for  the heads up, and the images.

I shall most definitely customize directory lists now, and the error pages.
I do feel a few style sheets coming on.

Does this show that it's the Xitami application leaking the memory and
not our LRWP application?

Subject: [Xitami] Max Server connections
Message-ID: <BAY105-DAV208AE087B5FE68CE093223F8B00@phx.gbl>

I am running windows 2003 server on a pretty loaded Pentium IV, dual core, 4Gb RAM server.  The documentation says that "max server connections" defaults to 20 for windows systems and that 0 means "no limit".  I have tried setting mine to 0 but when I save it its not setting.  If I set it to 0 it simply disappears after I save it and leaves the field blank...if I save it to any thing higher than 0 it will save properly.

Does this mean that Xitami isn't allowing a 'no limit' on windows machines and overrides with the default 20?  What is a realistic number for this setting?  100, 500, 1000, 5000?  I expect high volumes of traffic and think the physical  server can handle the loads I am anticipating (at least for a while).

In addition, what is a realisitic keep-alive number for my server and loads described above?

Thanks

Blank means '0', so should be fine.  Realistically your server can
handle 2k or more connections at once, but your network link will
probably saturate first, depending on what kind of pages you're
serving.

5 seconds will probably be fine.  The higher you set it, the more
connections will remain open at once, and anything above a few seconds
is probably not helpful.

The best answer to tuning issues is to run tests against the server
using a bunch of web stress clients.  Usually 2-3 PCs can bring down a
server (on a private LAN) and you can see exactly where things break.

Hi guys,

I've been running xitami on various Windows boxes for years now (NT4 first
-> 2000 -> and currently 2003) and have accumilated a large list of vhosts
(friends, family, etc). The thing is, I want to now shift over to a NetBSD
based machine and am trying to compile from source. The problem happens when
running the build.sh script - which generates a "c: not found" error. 

Looking through the mailing list archives, I found the thread quoted below
and also a mention of downloading base from www.imatix.net/pub and
extracting 'c' from there. I've downloaded base-1.2d7-src - but it doesn't
contain 'c'. Seeing as this thread was from May '06 - I'm guessing it's
changed since and been dropped?

Does anyone know how to get around this problem please?

Cheers!
Stuart
