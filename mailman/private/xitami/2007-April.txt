Subject: [Xitami] Port 80 mystery
Message-ID: <4616A9EB.5020206@Gaia-Enterprises.org>

I have just installed Xitami but when I try to start it, I get a message 
saying that Port 80 is not available because it is being used by another 
server.  I don't have a clue what it is, and doing searches for "server" 
and "localhost" only turn up Xitami stuff.  Can't find anything else 
that looks like a server to me.  There must be a way to look up 
something in the system that will tell what is using Port 80 but I don't 
know what it is.  The only idea I have is that I might have installed 
something with Dreamweaver as a test site a long time ago.  Can anyone help?

Toni

is this on a windows box? my guess is that you have iis running already. 
turn that off in services.

Try netstat /? for more info on netstat. You should find the command
you need there assuming you're running XP.

Hi, Magus...

  Netstat is SO COOL!  Using netstat -b, it showed me the executables 
that are using ports.  Now my problem is that I'm not sure which number 
is the port number.  Is that PID?  Local Address?  Foreign address?  All 
the numbers have four digits; I think I remember that anything that has 
80 or 81 as last two digits is port 80, is that correct?  So I saw that 
Foldershare, MS's web-based service for syncing documents between 
computers, showed 2280 so I closed it.  When that didn't solve the 
problem I uninstalled Foldershare completely and restarted the computer, 
and STILL I get the same message.  Now only thunderbird and google 
notify are using ports and  none of the numbers end in 80 or 81. 

In Xitami's FAQ it says that the port for Xitami can be changed by 
creating a file default.cfg and designating a different port.  So I can 
try that but I'd rather identify what is tying up port 80 because it 
bothers me not to know.

I'm running xp.  I think you sent this before getting my later message, 
but you've given me next steps and these details are extremely helpful.  
I'll go do these pending your next.  This is a great learning experience 
for me, by the way, and your help is much appreciated.

Search for each executable name listed for what it is and what it does. 
  Local address is the one that should specify the port.

netstat -a -b

Gives much more information.  It also takes a while.

You're looking for the Local Address that shows:

TCP  YourComputerName:80  YourComputerName:0  LISTENING  SomeProcessID
[ExeFileInTaskManager]

Search Google to see what that EXE is.  Actually, you should know what 
ALL the executables currently running on your system do.  Searching 
Google turns up the results for everything usually with significant details.

Hi, Thomas...

Here's what I just sent Magus.  I just don't see any port 80 in there.  ????

Here's the stuff that came up with netstat -a -b.  I don't see anything 
but mysql server -- is that the problem?  Or am I missing something?

I shudda included this before -- part of the error message is 
(WDAEADDRINUSE).  I assumed it was just the system's language for saying 
the port is in use but maybe it means something more specific?

Jason, I didn't see your message for hours because Thunderbird tagged it 
as junk and it sat in the Junk mailbox until I checked it this evening, 
and guess what!  You're right!  Xitami is now running.  Thanks!

However, when I turned off IIS I got a message box telling me that it 
would also turn off SMTP services, so we'll see if I can send this email.

Thanks to Magus and Thomas, too, for trying to help.  Although they 
hadn't got to this answer yet, following their suggestions taught me a 
lot of stuff I needed to learn, so your time wasn't wasted!

If Xitami refuses to let you into the browser based configuration then you
have to make some changes in the authorization configuration files.

Change to c:\xitami and use Notepad to create two files:

   1. defaults.cfg:

   [Security]
       filename=defaults.aut

   2. defaults.aut:

   [/Admin]
       admin=verysecret



Now use userid 'admin' and password 'verysecret'. (From the Xitami 'FAQ.')

Stop Xitami and then restart it so that it reads your changes.

Toni,

create a new file default.aut with notepad. When saving in notepad, put
this in the box "default.aut."  The " will prevent windows to add the
default .txt file extension to the file. In this way it is not a .txt file
Put this in the file

[/admin]
    your username here = "your password here"
    Webmask = "192.168.100.*"

Replace 'your username here' with your username and 'your password here'
with your password. Please leave the " around the password
And the above IP range change with yours. This tells xitami which IP range
or even only one single IP if you wish, will be allowed to use for
webaccess to the admin area. I liked more reading and configuring with the
files itself.

And If you make changes to the configuration file, please make a new one.
DON'T change xitami.cfg, make a new defaults.cfg which contains your
customized settings.

Take the time to read the xitami.cfg file and you will learn most of the
handling/working of xitami.

Johannes

I was not successful logging in using either this method from Johannes 
nor the one in the FAQ (which I had missed somehow and Rick told me 
about).  I have checked and doublechecked to be sure I entered 
everything correctly, for both techniques.  ???  I see only one thing 
that might make a difference.  My Xitami start window has TWO IP 
addresses, 198... and 127....  Both bring up the Xitami welcome page in 
the browser.  Does this change the way I need to set up the defaults.aut 
file?  I even tried using a different browser.

Message-ID: <000701c77852$5dccc220$1f0a6552@lbd>

Hi all,

Has anyone tried to make a LRWP client in PERL?
I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I can't seem to get any response from
the LRWP agent when my script is connecting :

---- start of script ----
# name of the server extension programme (accessible with
http://localhost/test)
$nameLRWP = 'test';

push @INC, 'G:/Prog/perl';
use IO::Socket::INET;

# launch TCP connection
$canalLRWP = IO::Socket::INET->new('PeerAddr', '127.0.0.1', 'PeerPort',
'81', 'Proto', 'tcp');
$canalLRWP->connected() or die 'can\'t connect!';

binmode($canalLRWP);
$canalLRWP->autoflush(1);

# send the startup string
print $canalLRWP "$nomLRWP\xFF\xFF";

# echo back (to STDOUT) whatever was read from socket, and output a simple
message to the LRWP agent
while($request = <$canalLRWP>)
{
print "Request :\n$request\n";
print $canalLRWP '000000009', 'All right';
}

# close the socket
$canalLRWP->shutdown(2);
---- end of script ----


In the DOS32 console window, XITAMI tells me that the connection was
successful (xilrwp: Peer test connected for <any> host), but no answer on
the socket (should be "OK" or "ERROR ..."). Besides, even a simple HTML form
cannot seem to POST its data to my program. It seems the whole thing can't
get past that OK/ERROR part of the protocol.

Any clue anyone?
Thanks

Bruno

Subject: [Xitami] LRWP problem (no more)
Message-ID: <001301c7787d$5b1fbc00$230a6552@lbd>

My bad. I stumbled upon the testlrwp.pl file in an old Xitami install (in
the addons directory) and tested it with no problem. It appears my problem
has nothing to do with the Xitami LRWP agent but rather with my own lackings
about how the <> operator works in PERL. <> reads in data up to the input
record separator ($/), which is usually \n or \r\n. Because communications
between a LRWP programme and the LRWP agent don't use any string terminator
character, I assume my script waited indefinitely for a \n to show up on the
socket after receiving the status message (OK or ERROR...). That's why the
Xitami team used sysread instead, in the LRWP test file.

All is well, then. Have a nice day, people.

Bruno

Toni,

as Rick mentioned, you have to create the defaults.cfg file with the
reference to defaults.aut . I actually forgot about this, as I am no
longer using xitami activially. Please check your files and entries.
You should be able to call xitami in the browser with http://youriphere/admin

This should bring up the username/password window

Hi, Johannes...
Yes, I did create both the cfg and the aut files.  I realized that I 
need both even though you didn't mention the aut file specifically.  
I've been going through this over and over this morning and just can't 
find anything wrong, the username/password window DOES come up but it 
just doesn't accept the ID and password I set up, whether I use admin 
and verysecret from the faq, or my own.  I feel sure the two files need 
to go in same directory as xitami.cfg, right? I am wondering if 
something is missing in the installation of Xitami, any other things I 
might need on my system.  When I received this message from you I was 
reading through documentation but haven't come across anything yet.  It 
appears I only need to decompress the zip file and put the folder on my 
c: drive.  It doesn't appear to install anything in registry, is that 
right?  Have been wondering about that.

I appreciate your help.

Toni

Toni,

correct, both files go in the same directory and because the
username/password box is coming up the setup is correct. You MUST have
something wrong with the username password entries. That is the only spot
I can think of.

Well, I cut and pasted from FAQ, so I don't think the username password 
entries can be wrong.  Did the same thing with your suggestions, and 
with Rick's.  And Notepad has four different options for encoding when 
saving; I saved in all four (ANSI, Unicode, etc.).  Stumped.  I even 
totally reinstalled Xitami.  I'm out of things to try. 
Long experience as a computer user tells me that when the answer 
emerges, it will be something maddeningly simple.  Sigh.

I guess it's time you just show us your files by marking the password /
username with xxxx
Did you write correct the .aut file in your .cfg file ? Can you check that ?

Johannes, I appreciate your hanging in there with me on this, but as I
said in last message, I don't see how the files can be wrong when I cut
and pasted from FAQ and have checked and rechecked innumerable times.
But because you asked for it, here they are (I have substituted the
sample ID and password from the FAQ for my own):

The defaults.aut file:
[/Admin]
   admin=verysecret

The defaults.cfg file:
[Security]
    filename=defaults.aut

FWIW here's my defaults.cfg security entry:

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"

Here's what I would use in defaults.aut:

[/Admin]
    admin=verysecret

Also check xitami.cfg, not defaults.cfg, to make certain that in the
[Security] section you have: admin=1 and not admin=0. If I remember
the source code correctly the admin item is only good in xitami.cfg.

The only other things I can think of are silly errors, remember that
the case of admin doesn't matter when you type it into the User Name
box but that case for the password _does_ matter when you type it into
the Password box in the Prompt window.

Also the top line of the Prompt window should read 'Enter username and
password for "/admin" at http://127.0.0.1' if you type
"http://127.0.0.1/admin" into the location bar of your browser. If you
type in some address other than 127.0.0.1 for your Xitami server such as
'http://brewhau.dyndns.tv/' then that address should be substituted
for the http://127.0.0.1 in the top line of the Prompt window.

I hope this helps.

hi toni,

i just took a look at my own files to compare...
you might want to try writing it out like this (with spaces and quotes) to
see if it betters your mileage.

[/admin]
    Admin = "verysecret"

&

[Security]
    Filename = "defaults.aut"


and remember to restart xitami immediately after making these edits.

Hi, Magus,

OK, I checked xitami.cfg and admin does =1. I put the defaults.aut file in quotes as you suggest. I am always conscious of case when entering passwords, so that isn't a problem either.  I checked the top of the prompt window and it does say "http://127.0.0.1". Unfortunately, still nothing.

What just popped into my mind is that I might have a corrupted download of Xitami.  This happens often enough that I should have thought of it sooner.  So next thing I'll do (but probably tomorrow) is trash the whole thing and redownload.  It's gotta be something like that because I AIN'T DOIN' NOTHIN' WRONG that I can see, and I have been diligent in searching for mistakes as well as taking everyone's suggestions. I'll report back when I have done that.  

This is making me crazy and it's nice to have folks on this list trying to help, makes it a little less crazy-making.

Hi, Rick....

Nope.  Didn't work.  By the time you read this, you will seen my message 
to Magus saying I'm gonna try redownloading tomorrow (Sunday), that I am 
wondering if I got a corrupted download.  This is too crazy, I have done 
everything right with great care.  So that's what occurred to me 
tonight.  I'll report back after I've done that.

You're not the only one this is making crazy Toni, it's not doing all
that much for my sanity level either. 8=))

How do you propose to check whether or not your download is corrupted?

May I suggest that if you are using Firefox 1.5.xx to download the
installation archive (zip file) with, that you obtain mdhashtool from
http://mdhashtool.mozdev.org/installation.html and install it to
Firefox 1.5.xx. If you are not using Firefox 1.5.xx then I suggest you
use md5sums from http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/ Either tool
will let you generate a MD5 hash (checksum) from the file you
download. Follow the instructions for installing md5sums into the Send
To menu. I find md5sums a handy little free tool beaten only by
mdhashtool since mdhashtool allows both MD5 checksums, which are known
to be able to be compromised and SHA1 checksums which have not yet
been shown to be able to be compromised.

Next you need a md5 checksum to compare to. Since the author of Xitami
does not provide one, my reference version of Xitami 2.5c2 has the md5
checksum of 6e1e8c7499a3142498069cea49882f7b.

I generated this checksum by downloading the source code, compiling it
and archiving the result with WinZip. Next I downloaded a copy of
xiopen_2_5.zip. Then I ran a MD5 checksum on both. The results were
identical. I then individually compared the compiled files and the
downloaded files with Windiff. No differences were found. Both the
compiled and downloaded versions were run and provided identical
results. I therefor conclude that the above checksum is highly likely
to be correct.

 Magus

Hi, Magus

The big news is, this morning I installed a different version of Xitami 
and had NO TROUBLE logging in to web-based admin with my ID and 
password.  I got this version with Web Hosting Kit Pro, but when I 
realized that the version of Xitami provided is not current (it's 
2.4d9), and the instructions for using MyDomain.com are useless because 
MyDomain.com has completely revised their interface, that's when I 
decided to trash it and start over by downloading Xitami 2.5 directly 
from Xitami site.  So current status is that I am up and running with 
Xitami, but not the latest version.  I am NOT abandoning efforts to run 
2.5, I will continue to try to get it to work.

You asked how I determine if a download is corrupted.  I have a much 
simpler way than the way you suggest.  I simply trash the current 
installation, download again, and if the problem disappears, 
voila--strongly suggests my first installation was corrupted.  Not very 
techie, but hey, it works for me.  8=).  Diagnosis by cure. 

However, I AM using Firefox 1.5, and will take your suggestion to 
download mdhashtool, and will use it as you suggest simply because this 
is something else for me to learn.  You're gonna make a techie out of 
this ol' gal yet, Magus. 

By the way, I also checked Zone Alarm to see if it was interfering 
somehow, but it seems to be OK with Xitami 2.5, which I put in Zone 
Alarm's Trusted Zone.

Subject: [Xitami] From My Crash-Log
Message-ID: <20070419235302.QBOT1625.simmts5-srv.bellnexxia.net@smtp8.sympatico.ca>

I've been running Xitami/2.5c2 on a stand-alone WinXP-Pro(SP2) machine, "trouble free" for ages.  It's a very lean machine, with no extraneous software installed, that usually runs very well, and hadn't experienced a crash for at least six months prior to April 6.

Since April 6 however, I've experienced six Xitami crashes.  A clip from the crash-log is pasted below.

========================================

Abort at smtsock:Send-Timeout-Event-To-Self: (Getting-Event, No-Activity-Event)

========================================

I'm wondering if any of you might know what's causing this... and perhaps suggest a tweak that might help make it go away.

Between the point of good and bad, nothing on the machine or Xitami-configuration has changed... other than the addition of the usual Windows patches.

Personally, I think this "may" have something to do with the Windows (DST) time-zone patch KB931836... which I believe was applied on March 18, but have no idea how I'd go about working around that.

Any suggestions would be kindly appreciated.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami freezes after several hours
Message-ID: <5BA6EC56479B8F49AB43C808445E031E992CF2@sbsserver.tiltrac.local>

Hi, Have been using xitami for years with an LRWP processes. Out of
dozens of sites, xitami freezes at one. When the browser makes a
request, it hangs for a long time. I have seen it come back and start
responding again after a very long time, say maybe 15 minutes. Usually
by then somebody has noticed that its down and has restarted the server.
All sites have 2.4d9 installed on them and I tried 2.4d11 with the same
results.

Its not hanging on an LRWP request. It hangs on just serving up a static
webpage. In the access log, I can see the request to get the page, then
some graphics on the page, but it all gets back to the browser.

This happens after the server has been running awhile, approximately 4-8
hours.

Does anyone have any idea what it could be, or what I could look at next
to diagnose it?

Thanks,
Brian

Are the static files on a networked drive?

Since it's always happening on the same machine, I'd suspect either
interference from another process, or hardware issues.  When Xitami
blocks, pull up the task manager and see what is going on.

Ok, this may be a clue. I was getting ready to stop and restart the
service using the control panel applet and as soon as I opened it - you
guessed it - xitami took off. I noticed it because I had a browser page
waiting on a response the whole time I was looking at it. As soon as I
opened the control panel applet, the page completed loading.

That might have been a cached page from the browser cache.  IE will do 
that - other browsers might too.

Does your computer, by any chance, sleep/hibernate?  Check your "Power 
Management" settings and see if any components go to sleep after a set 
amount of time.  Check your screensaver settings as well.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami freezes after several hours
Message-ID: <5BA6EC56479B8F49AB43C808445E031E992CFC@sbsserver.tiltrac.local>

It did it again! I opened a browser and it hung waiting for the
response. As soon as I opened the control panel applet, the page loaded.
I'm going to leave the applet open for a while and see what happens.

As for power options the computer is set to always keep disk and monitor
power on. The screen saver is set to go to a blank screen after 1 minute
and prompt for a password to come out of it. The LAN card has no "power
saving" options checked.

Thanks for the suggestions,
Brian
