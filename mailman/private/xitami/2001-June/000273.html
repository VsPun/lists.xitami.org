I was having problems with both browsers as well until I added some meta tags:

&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;expires&quot; content=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot;&gt;

In theory this tells the browser to not cache anything and that the
document expires immediately.  I haven't had problems with updating normal
content, but Netscape won't refresh images when they change if they are
available in the cache.

Now, there would be a useful utility:  something that resides in the system
tray and when you right-click, you can flush the memory and disk caches of
IE and Netscape.  I'll bet something like that exists...hmm...guess not
(searched both ZDnet.com and download.com).  Anyone up to the task?  Disk
caches are fairly easy, memory caches are another story.
