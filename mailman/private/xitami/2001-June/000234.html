<PRE>Hi:

Although I have been coding HTML for about 4 yrs now, I have yet to 
setup a server and am having a bit of trouble.  I am running 
Win98SE.  I downloaded 2.5b4 and installed it and ping 127.0.0.1 
without any hitches: setting up virtual hosting has eluded me so far.

I have several website projects underway right now and on some of 
their servers, I can use SSI and Perl and would like to code and test 
as if I were using their servers.  My hard drives have many partitions 
and as a result, Xitami is installed on H:\Xitami and my websites are 
located at O:\WebSites\... for example, O:\WebSites\stc, 
O:\WebSites\mndm, O:\WebSites\cuac, and so on.  I would like to 
setup Xitami so that when I use SSI on the stc site, the server will 
run it properly.

I tried setting up virtual hosts so that one IP address may be used 
for multiple sites such as 127.0.0.1=stc.cfg, 127.0.0.1=mndm.cfg 
but I didn't know how to call up the sites using my browser.  I then 
tried the DNS approach and set virtual hosting to 
www2.stc.com=stc.cfg but when I typed www2.stc.com in my 
browser's location bar, it dialed in and tried to find it on the 
Internet.  The help notes mention something about setting up a DNS 
server but I don't know how to do that.

For my purposes, which method is better and how do I set it up and 
how do I call up the &quot;local&quot; site?  I read the FAQ and the help notes 
but I either didn't understand or I didn't see what I was looking for.

Jules
