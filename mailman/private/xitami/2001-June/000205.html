<PRE>In message &lt;000501c0f96e$a216dce0$<A HREF="mailto:830a5f82@hm.uwa.edu.au">830a5f82@hm.uwa.edu.au</A>&gt;, &quot;Don Gordon&quot; writes:
&gt;<i>Debug log for 2nd RealAudio file. Does this info give any clue to where the
</I>&gt;<i>problem is occuring. I have also included the previous page which has only
</I>&gt;<i>one RA file which plays fine.
</I>
Unfortunately it seems that the debug log doesn't show the detail I was
hoping.  We'll just have to make do with the access log: it should show
a &quot;401&quot; response (authentication required) for the ones that are going
to prompt for passwords, and a &quot;200&quot; response (found) when it sends the
file out.  Possibly the order in which the requests come in, and which
ones get a 401 response will give us some idea what is going on.

&gt;<i>From what you've said it appears for some reason that IE doesn't send
</I>the authentication information with the second Real element on the page
(or Xitami doesn't accept it for some reason).
