<PRE>Hi Espen !

I downloaded xitami2.5b4 for beos from bebits and installed it.
The result - generally I can say that it works. I can suppose what confused
you.
This is not a gui app, it's a console version. If you accepted default
location for installation then you have to:
start the Terminal
cd /boot/apps/Xitami    (mind case sensitivity)
xitami -s (to run Xitami in background or)
xitami -S (to run in foreground, default)
Use xitami -h for options.

Anyway I encountered some problems. I belive all files included in the
package are the same as for windows distributions which I use except the
binary itself. Thus I guess it wasn't properly compiled, something wrong
with paths. For example the images located in ./webpages/images do not load
if I type <A HREF="http://localhost/images/image_1.gif,">http://localhost/images/image_1.gif,</A> but they do if I type
<A HREF="http://localhost//images/image_1.gif.">http://localhost//images/image_1.gif.</A> On the other hand
./webpages/xitami/images works fine and
<A HREF="http://localhost/xitami/images/image_1.gif">http://localhost/xitami/images/image_1.gif</A> displays as desired. Probably for
the same reason an image map on the front page doesn't work. When I click
for testcgi.exe url on the map, it resolves as http:/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe
CGI themselves work fine, as well as SSI.
Perhaps, some tweaking can be done with configs. Didn't have time to try it
yesterday. All I wanna say that it didn't install well from scratch as my
windows version did.

Another serious issue for me is that when Xitami is started, cpu load for my
amd duron 750 goes up to 100% and stays there until I stop the server. I
have no idea what's going wrong. Never experienced that with any other BeOS
app.

I hope this info will be of value to you and I would like to hear your
comments on whether you'll be able to get it going.

Mike.
