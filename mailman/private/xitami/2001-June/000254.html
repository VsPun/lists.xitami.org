<PRE>     I have two friends who run FTP sites but they don't use XITAMI.  When I
use the Windows 98 based FTP client to look at their sites I can't see other
disk drives.  These people have several hard drives full of information but
I can only see whichever drive I end up on when I log in.  In order to see
the other hard drives on their sites I have to use one of the other popular
FTP clients such as Cute or WSFTP.  I'm running XITAMI and I can see my one
other hard drive fine with the Windows 98 based FTP client.  Is there
something different about XITAMI or is it the way they have their sites set
up?  I much prefer the Windows 98 FTP client when it works.  If I get my
homework done maybe I can convince them as to why they should switch to
XITAMI.
