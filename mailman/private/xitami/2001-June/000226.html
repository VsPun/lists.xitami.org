<PRE>on ssi_insecure:

I'm running Xitami 2.5b5(gui) now on w2k and test also on w98/wME.
The same result for all these - ssi_insecure applies only to #exec cmd. Also
with b3 and b4.
Can't say much about 2.4d7 or earlier, I was running d6 for a short time and
switched to betas as soon as I've faced the virtual path limitations in
perlssi. I have my cgi-bin outside the web root.

|<i> Did not set it and can still do SSI? I would think that the version your
</I>|<i> running may have a play in that cool have you or were you able to do
</I>|<i> this in earlier versions of Xitmai as 2.4d7 and lower I don't know
</I>|<i> enough about W2K and its operating system I am curently running Redhat
</I>|<i> 7.0 and windows98 98 needs this and was just going by the doc's for NT
</I>|<i> Hey I am going to have to download Xitmai for Linux and see how it goes
</I>|<i> Just compiled perl apache/php and mysql this week and got it running
</I>|<i> still new to Linux and having fun.....
