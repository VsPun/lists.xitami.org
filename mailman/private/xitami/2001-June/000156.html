<PRE>&gt;<i> the RAM drive resides in non-paged memory pool, therefore the data it holds is never written to disk 
</I>
Hmmm... I don't think I even addressed the issue of writing. 

&gt;<i>  changes to data if any are written on an hourly schedule.
</I>
And certainly I'm sure you know that a RAM drive doesn't copy to disk by
itself, so I guess you'll be using a timer and script to handle that bit. 

I used RAM drives a LOT, back in MFM days when hard drives were slightly
faster than a telegraph. I'm aware that they are still useful stages for
program compilation, where there is much disk work but only the final result
has to be saved. 

But on a web server, my guess is that disk speed is almost never a limit.

Try it and let us know.
