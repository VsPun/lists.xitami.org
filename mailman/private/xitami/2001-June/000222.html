<PRE>&gt;<i> file transfers on my LAN are where they should be now.
</I>
I have NOT had my morning coffee yet, so don't trust these numbers until you
run them through your abacus. I've probably dropped decimal points all over
the floor. So all this may be wrong. 

&gt;<i> 340 Megabytes in 6 minutes on my 10 MegaBit router.  
</I>
0.94 MegaBytes/Second, 7.5 Megabits/Second is excellent for a 10-speed
connection. That shows that the LAN hardware is running a full 10-speed. I
have seen a shade higher (1.1 MegaBytes/Sec) on a new 10MBPS switch-- have not
seen that since everybody else on the floor got hooked up. 

&gt;<i> FTP from inside my LAN  About 340 MegaBytes in 30 minutes 
</I>
Even allowing for FTP overhead, 0.189 MegaBytes/Sec (1.5 Megabits/Sec) inside
a LAN is not great, but not shocking if the line is 10 MBPS. If both computers
and the hub are supposedly working at 100 MBPS, it sucks. 

I just FTP-ed 8.3 MegaBytes from the (Xitami, P-133, 10MBPS) server down the
hall in 11 sec. 0.75 MegaBytes/Sec, 6 Megabits/Sec. 

Are the PCs old and slow? Have you burdened the FTP server with aliases or
many-many Vhosts it must figure out? (You don't have Napster running I hope.)

Note that your cable-router does NOT have to be your internal LAN hub. I have
100 MBPS around the office on this floor, but a 10 MBPS link to a router in
the basement. When I find two 100 MBPS PCs to talk to each other locally, I
get over 3 MegaBytes/Sec. (I keep a 10 MBPS card in the web server partly so
it can't clog the LAN.)

&gt;<i> 340 MB in 5 hours through ISP
</I>
0.019 MegaBytes per second, 150 Kilobits/Sec, sounds like a throttled
connection to me. That's 3 or 4 times better than 56K modem. That's probably
what home cable providers aim for: as you say they don't want you running a
high-traffic site on a home-price account, but I guess they don't want it to
be &quot;worse&quot; than a 56K phone modem.
