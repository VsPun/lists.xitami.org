When Xitami &quot;freezes&quot; what is happening?  Is a CGI being started?  From
your description it sounds like you've got a virus scanner checking each
thing that gets run (including CGIs started by Xitami), and perhaps also
ZoneAlarm checking things that are running too.  Given that when you
have these turned off, you don't have the problem, perhaps one or both
of them is intercepting Xitami's attemmpts to run CGIs, etc?

Generally I'd say you'd be better off not scanning things Xitami runs as
they are run, but just scanning the files when you put them on the
machine.  And if you want to run CGIs, you'll have to configure any
security products you might have installed to allow Xitami to start them
automatically.
