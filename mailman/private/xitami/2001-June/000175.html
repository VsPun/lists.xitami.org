<PRE>Hi!

Perhaps that info can help:

Before I started exploring Xitami on w2k I used to run GUI version of Xitami
on Win9x,ME (xiwin32.exe). There is the way to start Xitami at pre-login as
a service.
You simply hack a registry a bit. Go to
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\RunServices. Create new
REG_SZ there. Moify it to contain C:\Xitami\xiwin32.exe (or whatever your
path will be). Bingo. Now your Xitami will start early before anyone logs in
and stay running after logout till you shut down.
Limitations: you will have no tray icon, you'll have to ctrl-alt-del/end
task the server if you wish to stop or restart (except wba) the server.

Mike.


|<i> This is largely because no one knows the answer :-)  Windows 95/98
</I>|<i> really are not intended for running services on them; any attempts to do
</I>|<i> otherwise are at best somewhat hopeful and as you have found.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> Basically from what I've been able to find out any &quot;services&quot; you run
</I>|<i> under Windows 95 generally start when you log in, and stop when you log
</I>|<i> out, and there's relatively little you can do about that.  Apparently if
</I>|<i> you install the NT Service version (bs3224d9.exe) under Windows 95 it
</I>|<i> will register itself in basically the way that you have found.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> Alternatively you can run the DOS console version in a minimised window
</I>|<i> as you have done (the &quot;-s&quot; switch doesn't do anything under DOS/Windows
</I>|<i> other than print out the message you saw; it does useful things only in
</I>|<i> Unix and OS/2).  However as you've found, it'll be stopped when the user
</I>|<i> logs out.
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> Basically if you'll need to choose between: (a) having Xitami running
</I>|<i> when a user is logged in, on a user workstation OS like Windows 95/98,
</I>|<i> and (b) running Xitami on a more server oriented OS (Linux, Unix,
</I>|<i> Windows NT/2000, even OS/2).
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i> Sorry about that.  But unfortunately it's inherient in the way that
</I>|<i> Windows 95/98 works: it's not intended to run &quot;services&quot; in the way
</I>|<i> server OSes are, and Microsoft went to some lengths to make it more
</I>|<i> difficult.
