Did not set it and can still do SSI? I would think that the version your
running may have a play in that cool have you or were you able to do
this in earlier versions of Xitmai as 2.4d7 and lower I don't know
enough about W2K and its operating system I am curently running Redhat
7.0 and windows98 98 needs this and was just going by the doc's for NT
Hey I am going to have to download Xitmai for Linux and see how it goes
Just compiled perl apache/php and mysql this week and got it running
still new to Linux and having fun.....
