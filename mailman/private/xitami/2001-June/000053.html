<PRE>Xitami Lives!  Long Live Xitami!
--------------------------------

Rumours of Xitami's demise have been greatly exaggerated.  &quot;It's just
been sleeping&quot; said iMatix CEO, Pieter Hintjens.  When questioned he
admited that Xitami was a rather deep sleeper.

Yes folks, it's Xitami release time again.

&lt;music type=&quot;cheesy&quot;/&gt;


Xitami 2.4d9 production version and Xitami 2.5b5 beta version
-------------------------------------------------------------

New versions of Xitami are now available from www.xitami.com.  Get them
while they are hot.

Xitami 2.4d9 is now the current production release.  Changes since
Xitami 2.4d7 (Xitami 2.4d8 has been skipped due to version numbering
confusion):

  - A more thorough fix for the &quot;Windows Device Names&quot; denial-of-service 
    problem reported by <A HREF="mailto:neme-dhc@hushmail.com">neme-dhc@hushmail.com</A> to Bugtraq.

  - The Windows GUI and NT Service versions are now open source.  The
    source code is included in the source archives at www.xitami.com.

  - LRWP binary/large files fixes

We strongly recommend sites hosting with Xitami on Windows upgrade to 
Xitami 2.4d9 (after making suitable backups of their existing system).

Xitami 2.5b5 is now the current &quot;beta testing&quot; version that includes 
GSL, a built SSI handler, and more.  Changes since Xitami 2.4b5:

  - A more thorough fix for the &quot;Windows Device Names&quot; denial-of-service
    problem reported by <A HREF="mailto:neme-dhc@hushmail.com">neme-dhc@hushmail.com</A> to Bugtraq.

  - The Windows GUI and NT Service versions are now open source.  The
    source code is included in the source archives at www.xitami.com.

  - LRWP binary/large files fixes

  - The NT Service version should be back &quot;in sync&quot; with the other
    versions, and not suffer from the confusion over &quot;templates or schemas&quot;.

Xitami 2.5b5 is NOT recommended for production use.   It is intended
only for experimentation with the new features.  If pain persists, take
two aspirin and call the doctor in the morning.  We have had reports of
problems that will cause Xitami 2.5 to crash, including malformed SSI
pages.  Take care out there.  Look both ways when crossing the street.

However if you want to experiment, we recommend experimenting with Xitami
2.5b5 rather than earlier 2.5 versions.

&lt;music type=&quot;jaws&quot;/&gt;


All your favourite bugs lovingly preserved
------------------------------------------

The updates listed above are the only updates that have been made.  &quot;All
your other favourite bugs have been lovingly preserved&quot; said iMatix CEO,
Pieter Hintjens.  &quot;We had developers working night and day to ensure
your favourite bug survived.&quot;

This version is the &quot;fix that Windows device names Denial-of-Service
problem, and get everything back in sync&quot; release.  We hope it will be a
safe &quot;drop in&quot; replacement for the existing versions with no hidden
surprises: if it worked before it should work now, and if it was broken
before it should still be broken now. 

We recommend you make a back up before installing the new version, just
in case.  Computers are good at finding surprises where none existed
before.
