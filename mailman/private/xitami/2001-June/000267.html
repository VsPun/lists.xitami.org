&gt;<i> As I was playing around with IE, I noticed that the headers contain some

</I>&gt;<i> this interesting idea that Xitami could do something horribly non-standard
</I>&gt;<i> and pass all of the headers onto my CGI (filter) through another
</I>&gt;<i> environment variable.  Here is what I propose:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)  Create a configuration file option to turn on/off the COMPLETE_HEADERS
</I>&gt;<i> environment variable.
</I>&gt;<i> 2)  During runtime, if the environment variable option is on, then the
</I>&gt;<i> COMPLETE_HEADERS variable is created.  Xitami stores the headers into the
</I>&gt;<i> environment variable as a zero-terminated URL encoded string.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of particular interest to me (and probably a few others) are the headers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> UA-pixels: 1152x864
</I>&gt;<i> UA-color: color16
</I>&gt;<i> UA-OS: Windows NT
</I>&gt;<i> UA-CPU: x86
</I>
Try reading the official definition of HTTP v1.1 (in RFC 2068 et seq) and
you'll discover that those &quot;headers&quot; are completely non-standard and will
be found only on requests coming from some of the computers that have
been blessed with Mr Gates's crap.

It's just another example of Redmond &quot;inventing&quot; an &quot;extension&quot; to a
standard in order to suborn the world into using Windoze, when those
standards were designed for interoperability between ANY computer
systems.  Such extensions are best ignored.

Besides, the principle of good web page design dictate that the page
should present itself in a manner that clearly communicates its
information content to the reader, independently of any paramters such as
those above.  Remember &quot;This page is optimized for ANY browser&quot; is the
best precept.

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
