 Well, it's listed as running on two threads here. I'm quite familiar
with the situation that I'm seeing problems that no-one else is
encountering... &lt;g&gt; Please note that it must have been something that
changed after v2.4d6.

 whenever you have something to test (assuming that Bernd Hohman had
volunteered to do the compilation for an OS/2 version) I'll be happy to
run it here.

&gt;<i>And it's useful to know that single-threaded Xitami is very stable.
</I>
 It's not making it single-threaded. Execmode only restricts the
software from accessing both processors and puts all the workload for
that package on processor #1; effectively making a given software as if
running on a uniprocessor system. From what I learned by following
other SMP-related bugs I came across it could be more of a timing
problem (or the like).
