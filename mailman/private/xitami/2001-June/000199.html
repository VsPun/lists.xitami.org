<PRE>Thank you for the reply.

The HTML file is located in a password protected directory while the sound
file (109k) and movie file (188k) are in subdirectories of the above. The
problem does not occur in Netscape and is occasionally fixed if the page is
refreshed in IE, but not always. I have also experimented using .ra as well
as .rpm files, no difference. The problem does not occur if the web page has
only one RealAudio file or if tested on the same computer as the server. I
have also tried setting same usernames and passwords to the subdirectories
with no effect.

You can check the test site at <A HREF="http://130.95.10.131/test/lesson01-08.html.">http://130.95.10.131/test/lesson01-08.html.</A>
The username and password are both &quot;test&quot;. The site is normally set up for
an intranet so loading may be slow. If by some small chance the page plays
normally, clear IE's temporary files and reload.

Further assistance would be appreciated.

</I>writes:
&gt;<i> &gt;Using Xitami v2.4d9 on Windows 98. Have set up directory password list in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;defaults.aut. This setup works fine except with IE when it encounters a
</I>web
&gt;<i> &gt;page that contains 2 Real Audio files. The page loads ok but when you
</I>click
&gt;<i> &gt;on the play button IE requests the Username &amp; Password again before it
</I>will
&gt;<i> &gt;play the file. The problem does not occur if password restrictions are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it IE requesting the username/password again?  Or real player?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's two things I can think of which might be going on here:
</I>&gt;<i> (a) the files are in different directories, and you've got two sets of
</I>&gt;<i>     protections being applied, with different realms.  You can work
</I>&gt;<i>     around this problem by setting the realm name in the .aut file
</I>&gt;<i>     for both protected directories to be the same (and making sure the
</I>&gt;<i>     same usernames/passwords apply to both).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (b) IE (which gets the authentication for the HTML page) and real player
</I>&gt;<i>     (which gets the authentication for the audio) do not talk to each
</I>&gt;<i>     other to exchange authentication information.  Which mean that both
</I>&gt;<i>     have to ask for that information.  This is certainly the case when
</I>&gt;<i>     real player is used externally, but I'm not sure if it is the case
</I>&gt;<i>     when it is embedded in a webpage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically if you are going to password protect both HTML and audio, and
</I>&gt;<i> use two applications which don't talk to each other to exchange password
</I>&gt;<i> information, then both will have to ask the user for the password
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are ways to design a system that protects the HTML and audio
</I>&gt;<i> without requiring the password to be entered twice, but it requires
</I>&gt;<i> server-side code (CGIs, LRWP, servlets, etc), and doing much of the
</I>&gt;<i> server-side authentication handling yourself, rather than relying on the
</I>&gt;<i> webservers build in basic authentication.
