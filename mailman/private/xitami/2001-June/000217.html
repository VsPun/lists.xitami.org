<PRE>     Paul thank you!  My network cards are 10/100 cards and I set them to
auto-negotiation and file transfers on my LAN are where they should be now.
I can transfer 340 Megabytes in 6 minutes on my 10 MegaBit router.  My FTP
transfers are still slow.  About 340 MegaBytes in 30 minutes from inside my
LAN
and 5 hours from outside the LAN both from within Adelphia.Net and outside
on another cable service but I suspect my ISP Adelphia.Net has a throttle on
this.  They don't want people running any sort of servers and all technical
information about their network is treated as a big secret.  I suppose I'll
just have to bide my time until we get a real ISP in the area.  I had the
network cards set to 10 MegaBits.  I thought it made sense since I had a 10
MegaBit router and I thought it would speed things up.

are they set to auto-negotiation?&quot;

     Thanks and take care.
