How do you call them in your HTML? Where did you put them so Xitami
would find them and know that they are to be executed? &quot;Xitami seems
to ignore them&quot; is really not much clue.

But back up. Do they run from the command line? Assume you have
compiled &quot;amy.c&quot; to &quot;C:\Xitami\cgi-bin\amy.exe&quot;. Open a DOS command
window and type &quot;C:\Xitami\cgi-bin\amy.exe&quot;. You should get a whole
lot of gibberish. If you look fast (or capture it in a file), the
first few bytes spell &quot;GIF89a&quot;. (Actually, I think it says
&quot;Content-type: image/gif&quot; and two line-feeds before that.)

Does it do that?

It might not, because the code tests the environment variable
&quot;PATH_INFO&quot; (probably doing things different depending on if it
thinks a webserver called it). So try it this way:

C:
CD \Xitami\cgi-bin
set PATH_INFO=foo
amy &gt; amy.txt
copy amy.txt amy.gif

(I assume that OS/2 command line syntax is DOS-Windows-ish. Check
it, especially the exact syntax for SET.)

Open amy.txt in a text reader, it should start &quot;Content....GIF89a&quot;
and be a lot of gibberish after that. Open amy.gif in an image
viewer, it should be a picture.

If it works from command line if PATH_INFO is not blank, the problem
may be that Xitami does not always supply PATH_INFO. in amy.c,
change PATH_INFO to SCRIPT_NAME (twice) and re-compile.
