Most ISP ask for some authentication of their users, so their server is not 
used as a 'open relay' so that bulk mailers can use it to send their junk.
The most used (imho) is 'pop before smtp' that mean you have to check your 
mail account just before sending your mail: the ISP's server remember your 
ip address and will allow you to send your mail through their server. THis 
is the simpliest solution for non-business users since there is basically 
no settings to adjust.
Another method is smtp authentification, you send your login name and 
password when connecting to the ISP's server. How you do that differs from 
server to server (your server, not the ISP's since the procedure is fixed).

Instead of sending your mail to the ISP, that acts as a relay, you can 
directly send mail to the recipients mailbox. Your server will have to do 
dns resolution of the mx record and connect directly to the recipients 
mailbox (this sounds more complicated than it realy is). This is the best 
solution if you have a permanent connection to the internet, but don't use 
it if you have a dial up since connecting to some mail servers can take a 
long time. It is the best solution because you have absolute control how 
you send your mail (some isp's won't allow sending out mailings, that is a 
single mail to too much recipients).

I'm using both Mercury and Merak and can inform you how to configure it.
