<PRE>Hi David,

Thanks for the info on POSADIS. I've downloaded it and installed it. I
have to admit that I'm having problems getting it to run, probably
because I don't know what the heck I'm doing. Do you have any examples
of the configuration files? I've read the documentation, but since I've
never worked with DNS servers before it's like reading greek. I put in
the default values in the configuration files, but when I try to run the
program it gives me error messages such as unknown command, but the
commands I've used are in the documentation.

If you or anyone out there can help with sample config files I would
really appreciate.

Kelly

  Have you explored a product called &quot;posadis&quot;?  It is free and is
  available through <A HREF="http://www.download.com">http://www.download.com</A> - it does require some
  configuration which must be done manually, but there is info on
  how to set it up so it is authoritative only for any internal
  domains you may be running.  It will run on the same machine as
  Xitami, AFAIK.

  Good luck,

  David

  I'm looking for a free or inexpensive DNS server that I can use
  within
  my company for my own needs. Is there anything like this out
  there? Can
  it run on the same machine that my Xitami is on or does it need to
  be a
  different machine?

  Thanks,
  Kelly
