FTP is secure enough, and is one of the oldest protocols on the internet. 
It is also one of the most efficient protocols to use for transfers of large
amounts of data.  There are other options, such as rsync over SSH, but this
would require a public key to be placed on the host server, and requires
root access, or at the minimum an anonymous rsync server.  FTP happens to
still be the most reliable and efficient client/host solution for data
transfer.  Any security issues with FTP is based on the server setup itself,
not with the protocol.  I consider giving a client FTP access to a server
much safer than giving a client SSH access.  Somebody with SSH access can
execute shell commands, while FTP clients are more limited in their
capabilities since they are designed to only transfer data.  If packet
snooping is a problem, use encrytped or EFTP, which is every bit as secure
as SSL.

Part of the &quot;problem&quot; with the FTP protocol and firewalls is that FTP
servers listen on port 21 while data connections are initiated by the server
from its port 20, to a port on the client identified in a PORT command. 
This port will be a random port number that is probably closed by the
firewall.  Using the PASV command is usually the way around this, but be
aware that there are FTP servers out there, that in violation of STD 3,
RFC1123 [2], do not properly honor the PASV command.  I do not know if
Xitami's FTP server is one of these.

As always, for any server administrator, whether you run a single &quot;hobby&quot;
server on your cable modem, or manage a WAN, a review of the appropriate
RFC's would be in order to make sure that you understand what you are doing,
and are doing it properly.  In this case, you would want to refer to RFC1579
and RFC959.
