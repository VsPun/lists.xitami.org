<PRE>Hello Toni,

You're not the only one this is making crazy Toni, it's not doing all
that much for my sanity level either. 8=))

How do you propose to check whether or not your download is corrupted?

May I suggest that if you are using Firefox 1.5.xx to download the
installation archive (zip file) with, that you obtain mdhashtool from
<A HREF="http://mdhashtool.mozdev.org/installation.html">http://mdhashtool.mozdev.org/installation.html</A> and install it to
Firefox 1.5.xx. If you are not using Firefox 1.5.xx then I suggest you
use md5sums from <A HREF="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/">http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/</A> Either tool
will let you generate a MD5 hash (checksum) from the file you
download. Follow the instructions for installing md5sums into the Send
To menu. I find md5sums a handy little free tool beaten only by
mdhashtool since mdhashtool allows both MD5 checksums, which are known
to be able to be compromised and SHA1 checksums which have not yet
been shown to be able to be compromised.

Next you need a md5 checksum to compare to. Since the author of Xitami
does not provide one, my reference version of Xitami 2.5c2 has the md5
checksum of 6e1e8c7499a3142498069cea49882f7b.

I generated this checksum by downloading the source code, compiling it
and archiving the result with WinZip. Next I downloaded a copy of
xiopen_2_5.zip. Then I ran a MD5 checksum on both. The results were
identical. I then individually compared the compiled files and the
downloaded files with Windiff. No differences were found. Both the
compiled and downloaded versions were run and provided identical
results. I therefor conclude that the above checksum is highly likely
to be correct.

Best regards,
 Magus
