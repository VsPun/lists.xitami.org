Yes, it is.  So was the prior version.  I understand where the spaces can
be a problem for some clients whose filenames can't have spaces in them,
but this seems to be a different twist on a similar issue.  I failed to
mention in my original post that I understand that the %2E syntax is a hex representation of the the ASCII '.' character.  Interestingly, the ASCII
' ' (space, %20) character does not come through similarly encoded.

Thanks for the suggestion.  If push comes to shove, I will try de-installing
and re-installing Xitami in a root directory.  Incidently, this raises one
other thing; Xitami is installed on my D: drive, not the C: (boot) drive.
Anyone know whether this could be a problem?  Again, this is the same setup
as the previous version, which worked fine.
