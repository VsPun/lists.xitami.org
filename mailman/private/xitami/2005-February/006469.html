<PRE>This isn't specifically aimed at your post Johannes, but I feel I must 
correct a common misconception: Adding an IRC channel, webforum or 
whatever will NOT remove the mailinglist. It will still be here, it will 
still be used. The other tools are there to improve on the Xitami 
community, not degrade it.

The more methods we have available for communication, the better. A lot 
of people hate mailinglists, a lot of people can't stand forums and 
quite a lot believe IRC to be the work of the devil. It is impossible to 
satisfy everybody, so why not enable Xitami users to use whatever form 
they personally feel best?

Of course it would be best if the people behind Xitami just took care of 
all this and made the best information hub ever, but seeing as that 
probably wont happen, I believe it is up to us users to take the helm 
and move the community forward.

Here's my opinion:

IRC chat &gt; Great!
Webforum &gt; Great!
Mailinglist &gt; Great!

Why this reluctance to try something new? If it fails, we can always 
fall back to the current system. It's not the end of the world.  :o)

Sincerely,
Thomas
