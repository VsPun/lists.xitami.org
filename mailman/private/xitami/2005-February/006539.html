<PRE>As far as I know there are no major security risks with Xitami, I have used
it for several years without any problem. There are a few Denial of service
vulnerabilities in older versions of xitami but I think most are patched
now. I love Xitami so much I purchased the pro version. There are several
advantages to running Xitami; speed, stability, ease of configuration, but I
think one major advantage of running Xitami is often overlooked. That
advantage is that there is such a small installed base out there that there
is very little incentive for hackers target it.

Subject: [Xitami] How secure is Xitami as a Web Server


Are there any known security risks or issues in using Xitami on Windows 2000
/ XP Pro? I run an LRWP application, but do not run PHP, Python, etc. What
about buffer over-runs, etc?  Has any body ever been &quot;hacked&quot; where the
perpertrators got in through Xitami?

I need proof to show that Xitami is secure before some of our customers will
agree to use it.   Of course, showing them a printout of a post from this
list is not conclusive proof, but it's a start at what to look at.

I seem to remember reading in this list about Imatrix will do some security
updates from time to time.

Thanks,
Brian
