Again, the needs of the one out weigh the needs of the many.

You need to have a few words with your company.  I can understand IRC
being
blocked, but a web forums too???? That's rediculous.

IRC CHAT,  WEB FORUM, or usenet are not allowed on my company network
either.

I agree that an upgrade of the Xitami website and the interface to the
already existing archieve material, keeping everything under one roof,
is much more feasible for users who are concerned with the Xitami
webserver itself.

General chat, exchanging experiences on website publishing or with third
party softwares is not something that needs Xitami webserver's name and
this is not the actual purpose of the Xitami mailing list.

I personally can tolerate these to a certain extent on the mailing list,
and occasionally do enjoy reading them; but I do oppose strongly third
party software advertisements.

Subject: RE: [Xitami] Community

this discussion is not the topic for which I signed up for.  if this
type of
thread is what will be on this list, then it might be time for me to
look
at other options for a web server. add that to a program that crashes at
random times, and which I have not found a way to add CGI support and so
on,
it looks like even the email isn't helping me.  there is another free
web
server that does have built in CGI support, and that seems easier than
adding it to a server that crashes at random.

if the forum is changed to an IRC CHAT,  WEB FORUM, or usenet or other
format, I would not be able to participate since those services are not
permitted on my office network. there are others who may have this
problem
as well. The archives can be made searchable, and the FAQ's can be
updated
which would make an email list more productive.

I agree, a usenet forum would be even better than a web forum.

Agreed. And I am a bit suprised that a web forum is being persued
instead of
a usenet forum which would be accessable by both newsreader and google,
and
archived by google as well. Personally, I would not use a web forum.  I
find
web forum UI's are mostly idiotic and do not have the patience to wait
for
the web, slow updates and viewing one message at a time.  But if the IRC
is
going to be pushed, we might as well push it by network rather than
server,
if the server is on a network.

I am bit surprised that a real-time community (IRC) option is being
persued
instead of web forums which allow for differing schedules (time zones)
and
IRC-unfriendly firewalls.

Bennett, Craig wrote:

As I mentioned, that the IRC #xitami channel is good idea, but Thomas
recommended a bad nickserv.  The concept is still a good one,
people just
need to join the main IRC.  You can find me on irc.qeast.net or
irc.mindspring.com (nicks; Docmarten and Netramcod)


Instead of telling people to join a server in particular, it might be
helpful to tell people which IRC Network to join. Net splits aside, if
you log into an efnet server you should be good to go.
