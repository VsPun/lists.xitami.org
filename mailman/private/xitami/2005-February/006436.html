<PRE>Well,

I do think the Xitami Email list should be changed to a better forum with
searches, posting, replies, threads, etc.  Xitami email list is extremely
outdated.  On another note, I do use IRC all the time - from home and from
work - because it is a great instant resource.  With IRC you don't need to
wait hours for answers.   Having been a user for quite some time, though, I
do recommend using another base server besides irc.freenode.net.  I was on
it last night and realized that the freenode.net server is very isolated
from the rest of the IRC servers.  On the other servers no one was on
#xitami - I had to switch over to freenode.net in order to find Mr. Thomas
who recommended we do this to begin with.

I use irc.qeast.net and irc.mindspring.com = they are very well connected
and tap you into the largest IRC communities.  There are plenty other
popular ones as well but those are the most convenient for me.  Someone
should create a bot for the #xitami channel too, that way there is always a
presence on the channel.

I also believe if the iMatix folks simply list it next to their support
information that Xitami users will automatically gravitate to it.  An iMatix
endorsement is what its going to take for any forum to work.  Its like
asking &quot;who wants to play basketball?&quot; versus &quot;who wants to play basketball
with Michael Jordan?&quot; - which do you think will get a bigger turnout?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="mailto:thomas@kenshi.dk">thomas@kenshi.dk</A> asked me about an IRC channel.  My reaction was &quot;sure,
</I>why
&gt;<i> not?&quot;  Now, this reaction has gotten me into deep water often but a Xitami
</I>&gt;<i> IRC channel seems harmless enough.  Not like that time with the... but
</I>&gt;<i> that's
</I>&gt;<i> another story.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now Mark Doigny points out that there have been alternatives to this
</I>mailing
&gt;<i> list proposed before, and they tend to fizzle out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's my position on this?  Well, first, I think any party succeeds only
</I>&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;<i> the guests are fun.  What I mean is: iMatix can sponsor or encourage
</I>&gt;<i> different kinds of forum but it comes down to what you, our guests and
</I>&gt;<i> fellow
</I>&gt;<i> party goers, want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IRC can be fun, especially for quick answers to easy questions.  It's less
</I>&gt;<i> intellectual than email lists.  Perhaps after all these years of being
</I>very
&gt;<i> serious with Xitami it's time to try to get onto bash.org.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I'll join #xitami on irc.freenode.net and follow the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally.  If the IRC channel seems useful, we'll announce it on
</I>&gt;<i> xitami.com.
