<PRE>FTP now working on virtual domain!  Thanks, Johannes Prost!!

</I>&gt;<i>Sorry, but that is totally wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>You don't need to do that. As I desribed in my previous post, you enable 
</I>&gt;<i>the
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;virtual ftp server&quot; in the advanced tab in the router under
</I>
Finally dumped the FTP settings and only had enable, and tried logging in 
using domain.yi.or and port 8 8021 in ftp client..   That worked.

During the initial testing, we had tried using the external IP with 8021 and 
kept logging in, but no directories or data port 8020 connention in pasv. 
mode.  From these test we falsely assumed that a hard IP was necessary in 
the FTP default.cfg settings to make passive FTP possible because of the 
following:

xitami FTP  behind  [router firewall] ----- connecting -----  [user 
firewall] client behind firewall.

As Johannes Prost kept trying to say that none of my previous setting were 
necessary, we finally tried it the SIMPLE way and it worked.

NOTE: I did have to open more than port 8021 and 8020, I had to open a range 
from 8020 - 8030 and if I had more than 3 or 4 FTP users I would have to 
extend the range.  I believe this is necessary due to my tester's FTP client 
software.  Using the hard previous hard IP config, he always received the 
data port on 8020. After changing to domain setup, his client would change 
from 8020  thru 8025, during our test.
