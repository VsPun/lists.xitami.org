<PRE>I just happen to host a few lists myself... and this sort of thing &quot;just happens&quot; from time to time... it's actually quite common.  I've never personally been able to nail down any one particular cause for it, nor have I ever been able to catch my equipment misfiring when the problem's been reported.

I do know how to fix this problem though.

You must sit patiently for a day or two and twiddle your thumbs.
There's something very magical about thumb-twiddling that just makes it go away.

My mailbox is receiving the posts only once, so I'll guess the problem is either with your provider, or somewhere en route to your provider.  I know from experience though, that nobody in that chain is likely to admit knowing anything about it, even if they're able to see the problem happening right in front of them.  Believe a mail-tech as you would believe an information minister from Iraq.

Hope this helps.  Have a nice day!
