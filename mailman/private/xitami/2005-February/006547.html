<PRE>Once again, Thanks to ALL offering help and support!!!

FTP now working!   BUT!

First note, I have a dynamic IP.
To get FTP server operating I had to put the external IP in the default.cfg. 
  Also Force IP to on.
In addition Ports 8020, 8021, and range 8020 - 8030 were openned in the 
router.
BUT, having to put the hard IP in default.cfg, means that I will have to 
manually edit the default.cfg every time my dynamic IP changes.  Not a good 
solution.
Here are my default.cfg

[Ftp]
    enabled = &quot;1&quot;
    Limit = &quot;25&quot;
    Pipe = &quot;64k pipe A&quot;
    User-file = &quot;ftpxxxxts.aut&quot;
    ipaddress = &quot;63.163.33.138&quot;
    force-ip = &quot;1&quot;
    passiveip = &quot;63.163.33.138&quot;

Please commit if you have a solution for dynamic IP other than the current 
hard IP I have to use.
I did try putting the domain mysite.yi.org as ip addr, and passive ip, that 
didn't work, could connect but not get the data port working, xitami kept 
returning the local ip.  The only way so far to get the external IP returned 
so passive data transfer on 8020 worked was the above config.

If I am stuck with the above solution, can someone recommend a utility that 
will get a string from a file and then replace a string in another file, 
this has to be all command line or ini file initiated.  I have a Dynamic 
Update Client that saves a IP.txt with the current IP, and the same client 
will execute another program upon update of IP with dns service.  So Update 
client saves IP, utility will grab IP and replace the old IP in default.cfg. 
   (it would be great if Xitami did this with the DDNS module).

Again thanks to all who offered help......
