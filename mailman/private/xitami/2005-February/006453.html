I concur with that. personally I find Gmail does a good job of
archiving stuff and I don't need anything else.

I've broken Xitami a couple of other ways - GSL for example - and I've
seen weird crashes when windows is nearly out of memory. But on the
whole Xitami has proven to be rock solid and reliable and I've used it
on a variety of machines since the 1990s. Is it perfect? no. but it is
good enough and that alos applies ot the support. Its good enough but
not perfect.
