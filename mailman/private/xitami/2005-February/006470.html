<PRE>the problem with having three seperate channels for people to use is when a
user has a question on say, the mailing list, and the people who have the
answer are not checking the mailing list because they are using the web
forum, then those people are not a community. they don't interact. when you
enable several different forms of communication, each reach a different
audience of people. if there were possible to integrate the web forum and
email list so that you post to the email and it were also posted to the web
forum and the reverse were also possible, then you would have a better
option.

an irc chat only involves those people who are online at that moment. unless
those chats were archived, it only helps the people in the conversation.
then you have issues with irc chats for people who can't use them due to a
print disability and need to use reading software to access their computer.
they cant use irc even if they wanted to because information moves so
quickly that it is impossible to keep up.

Thanks for taking the time to read this,

/David

This isn't specifically aimed at your post Johannes, but I feel I must
correct a common misconception: Adding an IRC channel, webforum or
whatever will NOT remove the mailinglist. It will still be here, it will
still be used. The other tools are there to improve on the Xitami
community, not degrade it.

The more methods we have available for communication, the better. A lot
of people hate mailinglists, a lot of people can't stand forums and
quite a lot believe IRC to be the work of the devil. It is impossible to
satisfy everybody, so why not enable Xitami users to use whatever form
they personally feel best?

Of course it would be best if the people behind Xitami just took care of
all this and made the best information hub ever, but seeing as that
probably wont happen, I believe it is up to us users to take the helm
and move the community forward.

Here's my opinion:

IRC chat &gt; Great!
Webforum &gt; Great!
Mailinglist &gt; Great!

Why this reluctance to try something new? If it fails, we can always
fall back to the current system. It's not the end of the world.  :o)

Sincerely,
Thomas
