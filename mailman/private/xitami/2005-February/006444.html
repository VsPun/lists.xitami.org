<PRE>this discussion is not the topic for which I signed up for.  if this type of
thread is what will be on this list, then it might be time for me to  look
at other options for a web server. add that to a program that crashes at
random times, and which I have not found a way to add CGI support and so on,
it looks like even the email isn't helping me.  there is another free web
server that does have built in CGI support, and that seems easier than
adding it to a server that crashes at random.

if the forum is changed to an IRC CHAT,  WEB FORUM, or usenet or other
format, I would not be able to participate since those services are not
permitted on my office network. there are others who may have this problem
as well. The archives can be made searchable, and the FAQ's can be updated
which would make an email list more productive.

I agree, a usenet forum would be even better than a web forum.

Agreed. And I am a bit suprised that a web forum is being persued instead of
a usenet forum which would be accessable by both newsreader and google, and
archived by google as well. Personally, I would not use a web forum.  I find
web forum UI's are mostly idiotic and do not have the patience to wait for
the web, slow updates and viewing one message at a time.  But if the IRC is
going to be pushed, we might as well push it by network rather than server,
if the server is on a network.

I am bit surprised that a real-time community (IRC) option is being persued
instead of web forums which allow for differing schedules (time zones) and
IRC-unfriendly firewalls.

Bennett, Craig wrote:

As I mentioned, that the IRC #xitami channel is good idea, but Thomas
recommended a bad nickserv.  The concept is still a good one,
people just
need to join the main IRC.  You can find me on irc.qeast.net or
irc.mindspring.com (nicks; Docmarten and Netramcod)


Instead of telling people to join a server in particular, it might be
helpful to tell people which IRC Network to join. Net splits aside, if
you log into an efnet server you should be good to go.
