<PRE>Hello Members,

here my opinion to this discussion

IRC chat &gt; absolute not
webforum &gt; ok, accepted
mailinglist &gt; preferred

I had a look at the archives and the only thing which is missing for convenience sake is, to make 
it easier to search. 
I'm with this list now for a bit over a year, and i can't get rid  of the assumption that, as Ted 
pointed out, there are a lot people subscribed and lurking this list, but they are not &quot;active&quot; 
members. Why should the behavior change with a IRC or webforum ? Would those people more willing to 
help and give answers because we would have now a forum or IRC ?

I'm not familiar with php, perl, cgi, to be able to answer the questions as I would like to, but 
the ones I can, I try to. And with a mailinglist I can stay in the same way tuned as with a 
webforum. I can only read the mail (answer) as soon as it is sent, not earlier ! 
Those 30/ 60 seconds difference, hey come on, that's even nonsense to argue about.
And in regards to IRC; what's about timezones ???? Is everyone really sitting 24/7 in front of the 
computer to make sure to catch every message which arrives ? What is then about the not so active 
members i mentioned earlier ? What is the one sitting 24/7 waiting for ??

I'm in no way upset or disappointed, but those are only some objective views/thoughts I want to 
through into this discussion. The &quot;newest and fanciest&quot; stuff is not every time the best what it 
looks in the first place.

Johannes
