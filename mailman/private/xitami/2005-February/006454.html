<PRE>Wow, this turned into a real hot topic and it's probably time we moved on.
But one last promotion for a web forum. In a web forum you can have an area
for different topics and this could be one of them. Just about every piece
of descent software has a good forum and even some crappy software have a
forum. I think Xitami is great and will continue to use it. I have gotten
resolutions to everything I can think of here and have my own archive of all
most all of the messages for the last couple of years and sometimes refer
back to them when I need to. A forum just keeps things neat and tidy and
helps keep thoughts and areas where they should be.

I'm done,
Ron

I concur with that. personally I find Gmail does a good job of
archiving stuff and I don't need anything else.

&gt;<i> PS: to the twit who moaned about &quot;not using xitami anymore&quot; due to this

I've broken Xitami a couple of other ways - GSL for example - and I've
seen weird crashes when windows is nearly out of memory. But on the
whole Xitami has proven to be rock solid and reliable and I've used it
on a variety of machines since the 1990s. Is it perfect? no. but it is
good enough and that alos applies ot the support. Its good enough but
not perfect.
