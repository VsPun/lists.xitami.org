<PRE>&gt;<i> The users said they did noticed a big performance boost

</I>
That shouldn't be the case, seeing that Apache can run PHP as a 
module instead of as a CGI (I guess you are using a PHP based forum 
as that's what most forums are made in nowadays). Apache should smoke 
Xitami, as the latter needs to start up one CGI process for every 
page request. Of course, for HTML pages and images, Xitami runs 
circles around Apache.

&gt;<i> My question, is there any way Xitami will handle this kind of setup or
</I>&gt;<i> is it too big or am I doing something wrong?
</I>
I have been on this list for a few years, and I have never seen 
anyone even approaching that size of hosting with Xitami. I guess no 
one knows if it's possible beause no one has done it. Anyway, I would 
never consider Xitami for a project of that size because 1) the 
server is pretty much abandoned and has no future upgrade path 2) it 
is really only good at serving static content, meaning no dynamic 
pages (on the other hand it's probably the best server there is for 
that task). I'd consider other servers.
