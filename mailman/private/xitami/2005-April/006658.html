<PRE>Hello members,

first off, I am not involved in any way and I don't want to make &quot;advertisement&quot; for 
sqirrelmail. This is a xitami list, but sometimes one has  a need for a program to work 
with a webserver, and that is the case with sqirrelmail.

The answer is plain and simple:
Sqirrelmail is a webmail interface with which one can connect to his e-mail box from 
anywhere over the internet. The only need is a browser, as long as there is an imap 
mailserver where the mailbox resides on.You don't need a mailprogramm to check your 
mail. 
And it is not a mailserver and for sure not ment to sent mail to the authors of 
squirrelmail.

The reason for the project:
As I have different mailboxes for the business and privatly, I wanted to be able to 
controll my mail from &quot;anywhere&quot;. There are several webmail interfaces out, to just 
name a few; Horde, Ilohamail, and more and there is as well the www.mail2web.com 
which I used a lot over the time. But I wanted my own one, especially as I am running 
my own mailserver for over 3 years now, for privat and business. And a small 
challenge.
Everyone was talking Apache, IIS with ISAPI and by searching the sqirrelmail sites I 
found that someone got it running on xitami CGI. And that got me thinking and I just 
asked here on the list if someone had experience with setting up sqirrelmail on xitami.

I got 2 responses, Ron and Fokke Nauta. Fokke tried it and didn't got it to work and I 
thought, lets try it, if its not working, okay I have still the other options. But it worked and 
one reason more to stick with xitami.

As I mentioned yesterday, if there is interest, I will share my experience. If there is more 
then the 2 requests so far, I will sit down and create some simple websites, otherwise I 
just make up a description and sent it by mail off list.







Johannes
