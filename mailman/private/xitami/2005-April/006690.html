<PRE>  Mine is strictly experimental and I've not had time to check it out very 
much, but I wanted to try to set up a simple &quot;free&quot; mail server on my xp, if 
for no other reason than to give my site, and those that help with my site, 
a &quot;site-branded email addresses&quot; so I went with the ArGoSoft mail server, 
and it seems to be right on!  Very simple set up, free version, small but 
powerful, and will work with current email client; ie: outlook ex. etc. You 
will need the Pro version for an IMAP module, but it's not much, and 
ArGoSoft is a fully functional SMTP/POP3/Finger server &quot;for Windows&quot; which 
is a major plus for me!   I hope this might be useful to someone, and 
although I've not had time to work with mine much at all as far as security 
etc; goes, if anyone wants to take a look at the webface or even try it out 
you can check what I've got so far at: <A HREF="http://www.sorcep.com:8010">http://www.sorcep.com:8010</A>  and you 
can get your own or check it out further if you'd like at:

   thanks guys; take care!   harth


&gt;<i>Ok, love Xitami.  Love my mail server - MailEnable Standard 
</I>&gt;<i>(www.mailenable.com). The Strandard version is free but does not come with 
</I>&gt;<i>IMAP built into it, which is required for Squirrel Mail to work.  
</I>&gt;<i>MailEnable Professional has IMAP and HTTPMail built into it and costs $220, 
</I>&gt;<i>but if I upgrade to MailEnable Professional for the IMAP feature required 
</I>&gt;<i>for Squirrel Mail then I won't need Squirrel Mail at all b/c ME 
</I>&gt;<i>Professional has HTTPMail built into it.  Total Catch-22.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>SSOOOOO - anyone know of another good, free, easy to manage mail server 
</I>&gt;<i>that has IMAP built into it so I can get Squirrel Mail to work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Man, all this trouble isn't worth saving $220.  I might as well just bite 
</I>&gt;<i>the bullet on this one, pay the $220 and get a fully enabled MailEnable 
</I>&gt;<i>Professional that has WebMail built into it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>arg!
