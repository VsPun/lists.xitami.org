Subject: [Xitami] Can't connect to port 80
Message-ID: <3B142293.17543.335605@localhost>

Greetings;

This is my first post, and I hope someone has some help for me.

I am running Xitami on NT 4.0 SP 6. Once in a great while Xitami 
crashes and when I tell it to restart I get a message back that says it 
can't access port 80 because some other server is using it.(?)

So far the only solution I have found is to bounce NT, and that is a 
royal PITA!

Is there an alternate way out of this?

TIA,
Dennis

Hi!

I'm using Xitami 2.5b4.  When I upload a file thru FTP, the file is
automatically converted to all lowercase.  How can I turn this off?

Thanks,

When that happens, open the site in a browser and see what server
is sitting on port 80. I'd guess PWS, the mini-IIS webserver form
MS.

What version of Xitami, as a service or started manually?

Hi dennis go to taks manager and find the xitami process and shut it down
then restart

this should save you having to restart windows all the time

With some TCP/IP stacks (I don't know if it applies to NT 4), if a
server is stopped "suddenly", then it can't be restarted for a few
minutes after it has been stopped (to allow all the old connections to
die off).

One way to check for this is to run:

netstat -na | more

and look for entries with port 80 (".80" or ":80" at the end).  If there
are entries like that and it is telling you that you cannot restart
Xitami, then try waiting a few minutes until they go away, and see if
you can restart Xitami then.

If that works (ie, if it's the cause of the problem) we'll see if NT has
any equivilent of the Unix "this is a server, let it restart and use the
same port again immediately" option.

I have set

in xitami config file, but still see the server listening to port 81 and
accepting telnet, for example. And of course visible to port scanners. Why?
It can be a security hole in this case, I guess.

Subject: [Xitami] New mailing list system
Message-ID: <200105300938.VAA03799@pagoda.wgtn.cat-it.co.nz>

As you will have seen by now, the Xitami mailing list has been moved
from its old home at ec-computers.net (run by Scott Drake) to a mailing
list server at iMatix HQ (lists.xitami.org).  (The Xitami-Dev mailing
list has also been moved to lists.xitami.org; it was moved late last
week.)

We'd like to thank Scott Drake a great deal for hosting all of the
Xitami lists so well for so many years; it has been a great service.

The new mailing list system is running Mailman which provides a web
interface for subscribing/unsubscribing/changing your preferences at:

http://lists.xitami.org./mailman/listinfo/xitami

We have tried to ensure that all users who were getting the "digest"
form of the mailing list are getting the digest form again; and all
those getting the standard form are getting the standard form.  The user
list was transfered over yesterday so should be basically up to date.
In addition Scott Drake has agreed to forward the old ec-computers.net
addresses to the new server for a little while to help with transition
-- thanks Scott.

If you'd like to change your preferences, subscribe or unsubscribe,
please visit the webpage listed above.  You'll need your passsword to
access it: you can ask Mailman to mail this out to you by entering your
email address.  If you have any problems get in touch with me directly
(<ewen@imatix.com>).

You can also access the archives of the "new" list from that webpage.
We'll see if something can be done to make sure the old archives are
also available at least for a while.

For some reason Xitami is not recognising your option, and is starting
the LRWP module anyway.  Check that you have set it in defaults.cfg as

[LRWP]
  enabled = "0"

Which version of xitami 2.5b4 are you using (ie, which OS, and if
Windows which of the builds)?

Unfortunately there is no easy way to do this, because the ServletRunner
doesn't currently have a way to say "all files with this extension" to
Xitami, and hence GNUJSP cannot get its hands on them.  (The [filter]
section is for CGI-like programs, such as PHP, PerlSSI, etc)

The closest thing you can do that I can think of is put all your JSP
pages in one directory (or under one virtual host), and then tell the
Servlet Runner to ask to handle all files in that directory.

The "can't specify by extension" is on our list of known issues.

Thanks for the bug report.  I've put it onto our bug list.  I suspect
that the problem may have been fixed from within Xitami by now, but
we'll try to check on this before releasing a new major version.

Can you give the exact error message that is reported?  "slm isn't a
file or folder" is not one that I recognise, nor can I think why it
might be reported.

If this is in the config file, then for many of the variables Xitami
tries the value as an environment variable name before trying it as a
filename (that's how TEMP works :-) ).  So you could try just:

  variable = LOGS

And see if that will work for you.  (Since I'm not sure which option it
is you're trying to set, I can't check for you whether this "try as an
environment name" will apply.)

Message-ID: <3B150CD6.A420E427@trmail.triumf.ca>

I've recently upgraded to 2.5b4 on Win95 (!), and now whenever 
I try to download files from it using either the FTP server or 
using an http: URL, the FTP client or browser sees the download 
filename as one long name with the period(s) represented as %2E, 
or in the case of Netscape on Linux, the percent sign is converted 
to an underscore.  This behavior did not appear in my prior 
installation (2.4d2?), and I can't seem to find any configuration 
item to unset the behavior.

I haven't noticed anyone else describe this bahavior on this list,
so I'm assuming it is some peculiar setup I'm using, but I can't
see anything I can do to fix it.  Please help.

Yes, it is.  So was the prior version.  I understand where the spaces can
be a problem for some clients whose filenames can't have spaces in them,
but this seems to be a different twist on a similar issue.  I failed to
mention in my original post that I understand that the %2E syntax is a hex representation of the the ASCII '.' character.  Interestingly, the ASCII
' ' (space, %20) character does not come through similarly encoded.

Thanks for the suggestion.  If push comes to shove, I will try de-installing
and re-installing Xitami in a root directory.  Incidently, this raises one
other thing; Xitami is installed on my D: drive, not the C: (boot) drive.
Anyone know whether this could be a problem?  Again, this is the same setup
as the previous version, which worked fine.
