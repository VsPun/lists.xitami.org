Hi Everyone

I had a change of IP address and reinstalled xitami
  which changed the IP on the program.
But when I go to 'setup' it has the old IP as the 'site'
It says 'enter network password' but
password won't work.

Needless to say my website won't display either.

Thanks for any help.
Linda

You will probably need to manually edit the Xitami.cfg and the Defaults.cfg
files.  If you reinstalled Xitami it would have over written certain files
in the Xitami folder, others such as Defaults.cfg get created independently
of the install and only get created by the admin.  In fact, you didn't even
need to reinstall Xitami at all, all you needed to do is edit those two
files and manually change the IP address.  You can manually change the Admin
too in the passwords.cfg file (or what ever the file name is).

Stop the Xitami service, edit the Xtiami/Defaults.cfg files to correct the
IP, edit the passwords file to edit the clear text password, restart the
Xitami service.  It should all be good to go after that.

Thanks for your reply. i did back up the 
original xitami folder whcih I put back 
in place of the new overwritten one. 
There is no password file. I read all 
the config files looking for the IP and 
password and did not find my password or 
ip anywhere so there was nothing I could 
change. I tried to put them into the 
xitami cfg file where there were spaces 
there to put them (although they weren't 
there originally) and when I tried to 
save the file a message came up saying I 
was about to save as a text file and 
would lose formatting. saved it anyway 
because I didn't know what else to do, 
but still not working.  There was not 
much info in the defaults file and again 
nothing to be found about passwords and IPs.

Have you tried creating a "defaults.aut" file inside the Xitami
directory and placing inside the file an entry like this: 

[/Admin]
    your_name="the_password_you_want"

Thanks, I did notice there was no 
defaults.aut. What exactly goes where 
you put.. your_name. Is that the user 
name that I originally had? Also I don't 
know how to create a .aut file!!!

As far as I understand, your old user name and password are gone with
your old "defaults.aut" file. You can pick another name and password
then and create a new file.

The file is a normal text file. You can create it as "defaults.txt" with
the Notepad, type in the required entry, save it and then rename it to
"defaults.aut". 

To create the entry, give a linebreak at top of the file and then copy

 [/Admin] 

and then give another line break and then type in the formula
name=password and then give another linebreak.

But check first and make sure the "defaults.aut" does not already exist
in Xitami directory. If there is such file, then prefer to open the
existing file with Notepad and type in the above-described entry.

it is not really relevant to this post, but I thought to mention it here as I am tired of
the renaming of the files when using notepad and you don't want a .txt entension.

Just create your file as usual, save it with the option "save as" and put in the name
field your desired name with desired extension, but in "..." Example: you need your
defaults.aut > go to  save as and put in "defaults.aut" and it will be saved without the
.txt extension.

When you read a sentence like this:

"Also I don't know how to create a .aut file!!!"

this means, the person asking the question is not aware that a file
extension is merely something you choose to extend to a file name.

There is no harm in explaining a newbie that it is a text file just like
a file with the extension ".txt" and that you can open it with notepad
and you can even rename it.

Why does it bother you that I chose to phrase my reply this way? Does
everybody have to be a programming wizard to use and configure Xitami?

Hello Ayhan,

alright... i'll admit,

there were several very simple points in this thread that were flying
clear over my head until reading this last post, and realizing where
some folks in this forum may be getting confused or having
difficulties changing file-extensions.

one of the "stupidest" defaults (in windows at least), is how it hides
file-extensions from the user.  this (in my opinion) drastically
reduces a users' control and overall experience... and could easily
wind up leaving them vulnerable to all sorts of other nasty little
things that simply cannot be detected at a glance.

when setting up or taking charge of a new windows machine for personal
use, one of the very first things i do, is disable the extension-mask.
   - in windows explorer, click the [tools] menu
   - select [folder options]
   - go to the [view] tab
   - and 'un'-check the [hide file extensions for known file types] box
   - [apply], [ok]... and carry on

this 'should' allow you to see clearly, all file-extensions right
across the board... where they can be changed, simply by renaming the
file.
   - right-click / rename
or
   - single left-click a file-name that's currently highlighted

q )  how do i create a ".cfg" or ".aut" file???
a )  i don't.  i create a simple text file, then rename it.  :)

i personally fail to see anything difficult or complicated about that.

Actually BOTH posts were great tips and 
I was glad to have the two views.
I use Total Commander and renaming is 
not a problem with a right click.
Thankyou both. I'll let you know how it 
goes.

Hi Rick,

thank"s for the tip. What MS-OS are you using than ?
I still use the "old" NT4 and looked it up, but there is no such option.
I really have to go through the DOS-box procedure and that was the point
to mention that. If that's done with the "right click" on the newer
systems, he fine with me !!
But again, thank's; will keep that!I maybe will using a newer
system one day. :):)

Hello Ayhan,

sorry that it came over that way. It was certainly NOT my intention.

But, do you know that the person knows the way to rename the file ? With
"the right click"; that 
doesn't work. I tried my self and found out that I have to go through
the process of opening a DOS 
box every time for that. And that is what's bothered me and I just

Good on you guys. Well apart from not 
being able to get into admin, the main 
problem is that my site is still not on 
line. i made the .aut file and still no 
admin or anything.

Default.aut here makes and modifies itself with a very little effort
and by making it in the console you have ip access restrictions, realm if 
needed, login/passwords.

Basicly mine;

http://192.168.0.11/admin    (from my laptop)  takes me to the console.

click Configuration button,     at top of page click the link     'Security'

Password file  name it,   defaults.aut   if its not existing.
Define button ...
  /admin  webpages/admin 192.168.0.12,192.168.0.11,127.0.0.1

Click /admin     username  password

pretty much everything is done with defaults except there are a few fill   
text boxes and add some checks marks along the way.    Takes moments.

I can see my site in the browser using 
this: http://127.0.0.1

When I type: http://127.0.0.1/admin It 
puts up the screen asking for password 
and I get no further. I had the password 
written down so I know it was the right 
one but didn't work. So I can't get to 
console.

When I go to the url I get the error page.

If I have to make the defaults file 
manually (I've tried but nothing worked) 
can someone give me a clear example of 
the layout and exactly what must go 
there. In the copy of xitami that I had 
backed up, there was no defaults.aut 
only defaults.cfg and that only 
mentioned the virtual host that I made a 
while ago.

okay, here we go. Attached is my default.aut file exept the password. put yours in and you should 
be ready to go if your LAN addresses are 192.168.100.*

In case the attachment is stripped, create your file as desribed in the other mails and put the 
following lines in:(without the ---------) copy/paste 
only make sure you have a space between = and " otherwise it is not working for me here (2.5c2)
----------------------------
#*END

[/admin]
    username = "yourpassword"
    Webmask = "192.168.100.*"
---------------------------------

With this you should be able to open the console in your browser with :
1.  http://computername/admin
2. username password 
3. console window

I am using this webmask so I am able to connect from any machine in my small LAN

Subject: [Xitami] FTP Rename directory problem
Message-ID: <000501c5fa7d$bb39cab0$0701a8c0@BARTOK>

I'm using Xitami 2.4d9, and I am unable to rename directories.  All I get is 
"550: No such a file or directory" as an answer to RNFR command.  I have 
also tried Xitami 2.4d11 and 2.5c2 with no success.  Is there some solution?

First make sure your firewall isn't blocking port 80 & if you have a 
DNS  such as www.Linda.com make sure it points to your current url   
203.97.121.175

Stop xitami.
Look for defaults.cfg then put your defaults.aut in the same folder.
Mine is in  D:\xitami-25\app\defaults.aut

defaults.aut should look something like this;

#  Created at installation time
#
[/Admin]
    username = "password"[Private]
  
You can copy this using note pad,
change username & password to what you want,
save as defaults.aut
then start xitami,
type: http://127.0.0.1/admin & use your username & password to get into 
the console.

The defaults.aut on my system (XP Pro) is attached. It works fine
without spaces or the #*END. 

If you want to use the singular form of the file name as: default.aut,
then your defaults.cfg file should contain a line like this: 

[Security]
    Filename=default.aut

Because that's how Xitami knows the name of the file which is to contain
the authentication data and spelling of the name does make a difference.
The name of the file Xitami looks for by default (if nothing overrides
that in cfg) is plural defaults.aut and if not there then xitami.aut.

I've also attached the xitami.aut. It serves as the ultimate format
example for the aut files.

okay, here we go. Attached is my default.aut file exept the password.
put yours in and you should 
be ready to go if your LAN addresses are 192.168.100.*

In case the attachment is stripped, create your file as desribed in the
other mails and put the 
following lines in:(without the ---------) copy/paste 
only make sure you have a space between = and " otherwise it is not
working for me here (2.5c2)

    username = "yourpassword"
    Webmask = "192.168.100.*"

With this you should be able to open the console in your browser with :
1.  http://computername/admin
2. username password 
3. console window

I am using this webmask so I am able to connect from any machine in my
small LAN

If you do not have the default.aut then I believe by default it means
administration is disabled. Anyways, if you create a text file named
defaults.aut in your Xitami dir with the following format, it should resolve
it. Shut down Xitami and restart it after you create the file for it to take
effect.

Defaults.aut:

[/Admin]
    Username="password"

Just change username and password to what you want. Hope that helps.

Steve

Thanks for that. It would have taken me 
a long time to work that one out.  That 
gets my site online. Password still not 
working yet. Will keep trying.

Linda,

Your defaults.aut:

You don't have a linebreak after the name=password entry in the
defaults.aut. It goes one record per line and a line ends with a
linebreak. Add a linebreak to end the record. Actually add many
linebreaks to the end of the file so this won't happen to you in future
again.

Other than that, the format is perfectly fine. You don't have to have
anything else in the file. I don't and it works.

There are other things to say about your virtual hosts bur I think you
should get your admin password working first.

Ayhan

What happens if you manually type at your browser: http://12.34.56.78 with your actual new IP-address?

When your site appears then try http://12.34.56.78/admin

Thanks. I got the site online. The 
internet provider did not think to point 
the url to the new IP address. I told 
him they should check whether someone is 
hosting their site next time they change 
someones IP address.

It's an invisible combination of characters (linefeed and return) which
marks the end of a line, and it's the thing that allows you to break
text into consecutive lines when it does not automatically wrap in your
screen.

It is the "enter key" (the large one with a right-angled broken arrow?)
on your keyboard.

Do type it by hand because the character combination differs from OS to
OS, and when you press the "enter" key of keyboard your OS inserts the
appropriate invisible characters.

From tuncer at dalan.com.tr  Wed Dec  7 11:18:40 2005

Subject: [Xitami] Re Change of IP address
Message-ID: <EE5D17F9BCAE5645B246C3307D855072461431@mailsrv.dalan.local>

Linda,

Firstly, 

[/Admin]
   ltdeditions = "mypassword"[Private]

is not correct. Remove the [Private] and the brackets. If your pasword
does not contain spaces, remove the quotation marks around the password
too.


Secondly, there is something wrong with your virtual hosts.

>From what I've seen in your attached files, ltdeditions has a cfg file
and an aut file in your Xitami directory. But it is not in your
defaults.cfg as a virtual host. Your only virtual host according to your
defaults.cfg is the solarcharts.

The entry in your defaults.cfg is like this:

[Virtual-hosts]
    * = "solarcharts.cfg"

If I'm not mistaken, this means everything is solarcharts, ie no matter
which host name or IP the browser used to arrive at your server, the
configuration file solarcharts.cfg is to be used by Xitami whenever
applicable. (And neither your ltdeditions.cfg nor your ltdeditions.aut
has any relevance because no such virtual host configuration was never
specified in your default.cfg.)

This is how the defaults.cfg entry should be if you want ltdeditions
also:

[Virtual-hosts]
    solarcharts.com = "solarcharts.cfg"
    ltdeditions.com = "ltdeditions.cfg"

(I'm taking a guess here at the host names - you would know what they
are in reality and if you don't want a virtual host by the name of
ltdeditions then leave the second line out)

Thirdly,

the configuration files in Xitami are read in cascading order.
At the very core is the Xitami.cfg - which you should never ever change.
After that there is the Defaults.cfg - used to customize the server.
In the Defaults.cfg are your virtual host configuration entries..
These entries specify individual .cfg files for all your virtual hosts.
Then these specified .cfg file are read by Xitami for further
customization per virtual host.

So the priority Xitami follows right now for all server rules is

1) solarcharts.cfg
2) defaults.cfg
3) xitami.cfg

Any rule missing in the solarcharts.cfg is read from defaults.cfg and if
not there, it's read ultimately fron Xitami.cfg . 

The same applies to the .aut files because they were specified.
Because in your defaults.cfg you are stating everything is solarcharts.
Then Xitami goes to solarcharts.cfg and sees that solarcharts has an
.aut
file of its own, the solarcharts.aut. It goes to solarcharts.aut and
sees

[/Admin]
    admin=-

AND THIS IS THE ADMIN for Xitami. 
The user name is "admin" and the password is "~" .
No matter what your defaults.aut says Xitami will read the
solarcharts.aut 
because according to your defaults.cfg right now, 
"*" everything = solarcharts.cfg .

This was because I was trying to delete 
(unsuccessfully I thought) the 
ltdediyions one.

I have corrected the firt point and the 
second and not working still. About your 
third point, I don'y quite know what I 
am supposed to do.

I don't really mind whether ltdeditions 
is there or not. Whatever is easiest.

here is your sample you attached

#Created at Installation time
#
[/Admin]
    ltdeditions = "mypassword"[Privat]

those [....] are called sections. And under each section you find the instructions xitami should 
handle; like in this example section /Admin (admin console) you are telling xitami to use the 
username "ltdeditions in combination with the password "mypassword".
And I think what Ayhan is referring to is, that you only can have one instruction per line; line by 
line.
It should look like this if you have more in your default.aut ( without the ----------)

-------------------------------------------

#Created at Installation time
#
[/Admin]
    ltdeditions = "mypassword"

[Privat]
  some enties here if needed

[next section]
    and so on

------------------------------------
This format is for all the configuration files ( I don't know if that is the correct wording, I 
just call them that way) But to get your console working, you only need the admin section.

greetings!
i've been happily using xitami for 5 years now, with
php and mysql - without problems. but that was always
on windows. now i want to deploy that on a linux box,
and i can't get xitami to work with php. can someone
point me to some fool-proof directions to check that
i'm doing it right, before we start the
this-i've-done/try-that waltz?

I tried to reproduce your configuration with the asterisk and the error
but failed.

Though did I notice something in your defaults.cfg which Xitami.cfg does
not have (so Xitami would not be able to default to it). 

I think it needs this entry (two lines and then a linebreak):

[Security]
    Filename=defaults.aut

I have that in my defaults.cfg and perhaps this is why I fail to
reproduce your error.

This was because I was trying to delete 
(unsuccessfully I thought) the 
ltdediyions one.

I have corrected the firt point and the 
second and not working still. About your 
third point, I don'y quite know what I 
am supposed to do.

I don't really mind whether ltdeditions 
is there or not. Whatever is easiest.

i first became aware of this default "extension mask" (as well as how
to disable it) when i migrated from win-3.1 to win-98 (first edition).
 i recall being extremely angry that win-98 had hidden the
extensions... but the problem was quickly corrected, upon calling the
shop where the pc was purchased.

these days, i frequently use an assortment of different (o/s &/or)
windows versions... but must say that i'm not personally familiar with
nt4.

many people laugh hysterically when i say this, but my 'personal' most
favourite pc of all, is an old p-600 (with 768mb. of ram)... running
win-millennium (same install of m/e since october 2001).  i've spent a
lot of time tweaking and optimizing that machine... and getting it
tuned up just the way i like it.  it's far more stable, and (for the
best part) out-performs any other system i own... including this
crappy 3 month old lap-top that came factory installed with xp-home.

what's my point?

the "best" system of all, is the one that works well for you.  beware
of the man with the flashy sales-pitch.

That fixed it!!!
(As well as everything else no doubt)

Thanks Ayhan. Thankyou everyone. I will 
be keeping all this precious 
information. Xitami is pretty hard, but 
a little clearer to me now.

I'm glad that fixed it. I tried half a day between my work, disabling my
own configuration, to understand what exactly was objectionable your
configuration.

Linda, Xitami is not hard. There are these set of text files it reads to
decide how you want it to behave.

The text files are only tiny databases, where the records are separated
(delimited) in a special way.

The admin screen acts only as a translator (with limited capabilites)
for you to write to these tiny text databases.

If you take the time to open and read the Xitami.cfg + Xitami.aut, these
tell you everything (they have explanatory notes on the top parts and
the right side) you can do to change how Xitami behaves. Because these
are all the rules Xitami uses by default unless you override and change
them with another cfg file (and this is why you should never change the
Xitami.cfg and Xitami.aut files). 

AFter you start reading these, you also understand the Xitami Help

Good Luck

That fixed it!!!
(As well as everything else no doubt)

Thanks Ayhan. Thankyou everyone. I will 
be keeping all this precious 
information. Xitami is pretty hard, but 
a little clearer to me now.

I've been following this thread with anticipation to see if the issue
was ever going to get resolved. I'm glad to see it did.

I must say that the patience I saw helping Linda get through this was
astounding. Something that you just don't see everyday, nor on many
other support lists (where they would have screamed RTFM).

I tip my hat to you fine folks, this was very well done indeed.

Hello Craig Morrison you transmitted about OT: Good Job -> Re: [Xitami] Re 
Change of IP address


I am a lurking memer for about 4 years now and i've seen it more on this 
list, and i must admit one doesn't se it often on others. Most of my 
questions were always answered by browsing the list history files or it's 
just a current topic.

That may be said once in a while as you just did.

Xitami is great for many things but for me it's about the most 
userfriendliest webserver there is no matter what OS you're using with it.

Grts
Ted.

Yes. I did familiarize myself with the 
xitami files a bit and learned more from 
this.  The entry which fixed the problem

[Security]
     Filename=defaults.aut

Tells xitami to go and look at the 
password. I'm getting there!

Cheers!

Subject: [Xitami] Server crashes with no noticeable load.
Message-ID: <6.2.0.14.0.20051216054646.01decd20@mail.mrjdesign.net>

I have a minor problem with Xitami 2.5c2

I run a server with currently 8 domains on Windows XP Pro using this server 
and lately I've been noticing a few odd behaviours.

1) When connecting to the FTP server part, from Windows Explorer on a 
machine located on my own network, or neighboring IP address, the Xitami 
server crashes with an error in C++. No further explanation but the 
connection times out and then the server dies. There is hardly any load at 
all on the server at these times and when I connect from my linux box it 
works just fine and super fast. It only happens when I connect from a 
windows machine.

2) The same thing seems to happen a lot when I have 4 or more connections 
at the same time to one of the domains. It is not at all a heavy load but 
suddenly it just dies.
     This is not to hard on the system, however what is more annoying than 
anything is the fact that I click the RESTART button on the display popup 
telling me the system crashed, and it doesn't restart. It just dies and 
remains closed until I manually dig up the short cut to the Xitami GUI and 
click that.

This means if I want this to be running permanently, I have to sit and 
watch the server all the time instead of relying on any auto start or 
restart options actually working.
Is there a fix for this?

Thanks for a continued great service and an excellent server app. otherwise.

Hello, I am new in the list, first I want to request them you excuse for my bad writing in English. I am using Xitami v2.4d6 with Windows 2000 in an intranet with 45 work positions, the problem is that the Xitami in some moments is yellow and the clients don't find the you paginate html. The computer that I am using is a Pentium IV 2.8 mhz with 512 mb and he/she has 20 gb of free disk. I am looking for in the place that requirements require the web server for these clients but I didn't find anything.   
  
somebody of you. does he have a net of this type that I equip they use? can they help me?  
  
another thing the hits to the moment not to respond is in 260.

I have a problem, which may be similar.  When I am getting 4-12 
concurrent users, often the users will see no page load and their 
browser waits and waits.  If they click stop, and reload the page, it 
loads up immediately.  The max users is set to 24.  PIII 800 MHZ with 
1.5 MB DSL.

Ideas?

what kind of OS are you using ? In particular a server or workstation (WS) version.
As I recall correct, the WS has a limit to 10 concurrent connections and that is not only counting 
the users. I am a bit of a loss here to explain this correct but I am assuming that there lies your 
problem.

The 10 max concurrent users per server, is applied to MS Access databases 
accessed through ADO or ODBC through a CGI or ASP script.
This can be circumvented on all Windows machines starting from Windows 2000 
WST and up, by using a CGI calling the access db directly through ADO.
I didn't know there was such a limitation to Xitami?! Odd...

In my case, I have the same poor performance, although just a week ago I 
transferred a backup of my entire machine through FTP (245 GB of data)
between the wst which now cant connect to ftp and the server. In my case I 
use Windows XP SP1, with 3.06 GHz Prescott CPU,
512 MB DDR-RAM, and 500 GB disk space. 250 Is allocated to Virthost dir's, 
40 GB for the config root drive/partition where xitami is
located and 200 GB for my DNS and SMTP/POP3 server on a separate disk, but 
same server. This is the server.

The workstation that fails is XP SP1, using Explorer or WS_FTP for FTP 
transfer.

My Xitami is not limited to any specific number of users. I have always 
left it open.
And, Xitami has always manged this config well in the past. That's what is 
so odd.

I think your configuration of hardware below sounds ok.
You may rethink stopping at 24 users only though.

Aha.... I didn't think to check that the problem was the database.  I 
fiddled with the MySQL settings, which were quite low, and that seems to 
have taken care of the problem.

Hi,

I only just started experimenting with Xitami.

There's one thing I currently can't figure out how to do.  I have a site
where I want all requests, including ones for pages that do not exist to
go to the home page.  With IIS I just use the redirect to an exact url
feature.  I can't seem to get the same functionality with Xitami.

To explain

Page /index.php exists
User requests non existent page /testing/test.php
User gets sent to /index.php

Is this possible?

Thanks.

You should be able to do this by creating a custom 404 page with an
appropriate meta tag to redirect in the header

i.e. <meta http-equiv="Refresh"
content="1;url=http://www.mydomain.com/index.php">

You could use Xitamis GSL langauge to make the refirect depend on what
the wrong page was if that gave you pleasure. Take a look at
templates/errors.gsl for hints about what to do

You need an index.html file in your directory for it to work.

Hi,

Thanks.

Tried that, but it's very messy.  I want to log the original URL, and
Xitami does not seem to support a PHP page as the error page?  It's a
pity the error page can't be an external URL.  That'd work great.

 Try doing a redirect from your index.html file to your index.php file. 
Should work.

Looks to me like once you enable errors.gsl you can then tinker to
your hearts content. For example I just verified that the following
tiny errors.gsl will redirect to idx.php with two relevant get fields
the page (pg) and the referer (ref)

There is no reason at all why you cannot fully specify the URL so that
it goes to a different domain. And, if you muck around with the
permissions, no reason why this should only apply to errors i.e. to
URLs that do not exist. Alternatively you could do a check on
errorcode and only do the redirect if it is a 404 but otherwise leave
the standard error page

<HTML><TITLE>Error - $(errorcode)</TITLE>

Hi,
What did you fiddle with? I'm having same failures and am using MySQL in a 
cgi construction. I managed to solve all isues using Apache, but I would 
like to maintain Xitami.

Aha.... I didn't think to check that the problem was the database.  I
fiddled with the MySQL settings, which were quite low, and that seems to
have taken care of the problem.

Subject: [Xitami] ftp: change file attributes
Message-ID: <000c01c604c0$6583b480$fe79a8c0@mr>

Although I have set all permissions (*), it is not possible to change the file attributes via ftp-clients (I've tried LeechFTP and FileZilla). The attributes (owner: read write) stay unchanged. Doesn't Xitami support changing file attributes?

Yes it should but you're on windows.

The CHMOD stuff is a Linux/Unix world by itself and should be set by 
changing permissions in server editions of Windows directly.
Windows XP is not a true server environment as Win 2000 Srv and Win 2003 
and therefor lacks some of the permission settings as well.

Subject: [Xitami] Error in CGI execution
Message-ID: <20051222060233.28524.qmail@web33403.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Can anyone assist with getting the SSI exec command to
work? I have Ximati/2.5c2 installed on a Windows XP
Home laptop.

Xitami returns the following, with no additional
information that I can find in the log files:
[xitami SSI: Error in CGI execution]

CGI works.

The following SSI commands work:
<!--#include file="..."-->
<!--#include virtual="..."-->

The following so far do not work (the ssi:exec option
*is* enabled):
<!--#exec cgi="..."-->
<!--#exec cmd="..."-->

For the purposes of this question I have, after much
failed trial and error toggling various CGI and SSI
options, reverted back to a clean "out-of-the-box"
install:

	Application directory is: C:\Program
Files\xitami-25\app (location of xigui32.exe)
	Web directory is: C:\Program
Files\xitami-25\app\webpages (location of testssi.ssi
and testssi.inc)
	Cgi-bin directory is: C:\Program
Files\xitami-25\app\cgi-bin 

The "out-of-the-box" [Cgi] and [Ssi] settings in the
xitami.cfg file (straight out of the xiopen_2_5.zip
file) are:

[Cgi]
    enabled=1
    workdir=-
    wildcard=0
    timeout=60
    monitor=200
    dirlist=0
    msdos-style=0
    debug=0
    stdio=1
    mixed-url=1
    errlog=cgierr.log
    environment=1
    passargs=0
    http-fields=1
    http-prefix=HTTP_
    form-fields=1
    form-prefix=FORM_
    form-query=0

[Ssi]
    enabled=1
    timefmt=%A, %d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S %Z
    sizefmt=bytes
    timeout=30
    errmsg=<p>[xitami SSI: %s]
    exec=0

Before making any changes, I've opened testssi.ssi
(which "includes"s testssi.inc, which "exec"s
testcgi.exe) in my browser and Xitami returns:
[xitami SSI: #exec command not permitted for security
reasons;]

I've then made two changes. First, I've set the
xitami.cfg ssi:exec option:

[Ssi]
    exec=1

...and Xitami returns:
[xitami SSI: ]

Next, I've dropped a testcgi.exe into C:\Program
Files\xitami-25\app\cgi-bin, and arrive at the error
in question--so it's definitely finding the CGI
executable: 
[xitami SSI: Error in CGI execution]

For the record, testcgi.exe works when called
directly, as follows, from either the command line or
the browser:
C:\Program Files\xitami-25\app\cgi-bin>testcgi.exe
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/testcgi.exe?arguments

I've also tried unsuccessfully to invoke a simple .bat
file (C:\Program
Files\xitami-25\app\cgi-bin\helloworld.bat):
@echo off
echo content-type: text/html
type newline.txt
echo hello world

...via the following SSI exec:
<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/helloworld.bat"-->

Regards,
Tom Moore

Subject: [Xitami] enable HTTP PUT
Message-ID: <00c901c6071e$59c8c120$a864a8c0@achab.it>

Hi everyone,

I'm running Xitami on Windows
I need to enable HTTP PUT to "everyone" on a particular folder (alias /upload)

I added the following to xitami.aut config file

[/upload]
http-update=1
all=*

but when I try to do a PUT, I get the windows login dialog asking me for a username and 
a password.
Is it possible to avoid that dialog?

thanks in advance for your help

cheers

See the listed default example for how to add Anonymous as a user and allow 
users with no password to log in.
You cannot log in to FTP without having at least a  username, even if you 
disable the password or leave it as * or blank.

Message-ID: <ec672f1d0512290957m77f3d07fvffcc95c540d19f77@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

    I have loaded 4 different webservers on my machine (Windows XP
Home 2.93GHz 200GB 72000 RPM HD) and no webserver seems to want to
display a password
authentication box properly.  I created a .htaccess file in apache, tried
Roxen webserver, and Abyss webserver.
Apache didnt show a password authentication box, Roxen didnt either and
Abyss got the users and realm all messed up.  Now the case with Xitami,  I
have edited the Xitami.aut so my username and password in the administration
panel are different, and when Firefox or Seamonkey says Enter your password
for /admin at 127.0.01, the correct username and password doesn't work.  I
have reinstalled, reset and reconfigured my firewall and TCP/IP Networking.
Any help would be well apreciated.
