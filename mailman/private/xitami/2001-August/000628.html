<PRE>My sites are not on any search engine as they are private audience only.
Thyen a robot started indexing one area every two hours or so.  This was a
photo area with thumbnails and fullsize images meant to show a camera
manufacturer what was wrong with my new digital camera.  This  indexing
went on for days.  The only people who knew about it were the camera store
and national repair depot

The second page was a page of photos taken by us linked from our personal
page.  The only way to know it's there is to link from the main page which
I recently put into my email signature.  I made about half a dozen posts to
two mailing lists.  Then I started getting junk mail and another robot
started accessing that and another area every few hours.

In both cases of robot indexing, the answer was simple.  I just put a
webserver password in those areas and it stopped.
