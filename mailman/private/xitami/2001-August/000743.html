The messages that you're getting seem to be from the Xitami 2.5b reverse
DNS support (to try to figure out the names of the places people are
connecting from and put them in the log file).  Given the length of the
messages they also seem to be some sort of debug messages.

Have you perhaps enabled reverse DNS recently?  And/or debugging options?

The other curious thing about the address being looked up is that it is
a &quot;private&quot; network address (RFC1918) which shouldn't be used on the
Internet directly.  If you are using those addresses locally you should
set up local nameserver records for 168.192.in-addr.arpa (or at least
the sections you are using).

If you are not using them locally and they are coming from the Internet,
I strongly suggest you configure your firewall to block traffic from the
Internet that uses those addresses.  They're not supposed to be used on
the Internet, but there is a lot of misconfigured networking equipment
around.
