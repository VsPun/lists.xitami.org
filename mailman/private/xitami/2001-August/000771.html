&gt;<i> When all the IIS webserver administrators finally patch their machines,
</I>&gt;<i> clean them up, and reboot them, the problem will go away.  Given that

On which point, I find it perfectly reprehensible that someone could be
knowingly running a webserver and yet be unaware of the existence of Code
Red.  After all, the majority of infected instances of IIS exist because
their owners were blissfully unaware that the webserver had been
installed by default.

ANYONE running ANY sort of semi-permanently connected server should
ensure that they are up-to-date with CERT advisories for their platform;
it's a duty that they have to the integrity of the rest of the 'Net.

Incidentally, there should be a respite for a few days now: all the
machines infected with Code Red (1 or 2) are now (from the 20th of each
month) instead launching a DoS attack on the IP address that used to be
one of the servers forming www.whitehouse.gov.  This will continue until,
IIRC, the 28th, when the worm will go dormant; only to start another
month's attempt of infestation on the 1st.
