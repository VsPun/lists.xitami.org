</I>
Someone discovered that if you send MS IIS webserver a VERY long packet,
the end of the packet over-writes part of the webserver code. 

The &quot;NNNN...&quot; is just filler. The gibberish at the end is the worm. It
corrupts part of IIS and loads the Code Red worm. See: 

   <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-23.html">http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-23.html</A>

There are patches for IIS that close this backdoor. 

Other webservers (including Xitami) correctly reply &quot;Bad request&quot; and
don't get infected. The attack is very specific to un-patched IIS
servers. It relies on both a buffer overflow and specific locations in
program memory. Even if a webserver had the buffer overflow, on non-IIS
servers the subroutines Code Red infects are not the same, nor in the
same places. 

Even though Code Red does not infest Xitami, a Code Red server anywhere
in the world can swamp the network. It appears that much of my campus
was dead-slow overnight, though I have not confirmed that it was someone
else's Code Red trying to hit us. 

&gt;<i> My server would be hard pressed, however, to consume 5GB in logs 
</I>
However, my WinNT machine got sluggish when I had thousands of daily
logs in one folder. 

Xitami was just a hair slow, but NT file explorer was so slow that I
finally had to bring the machine off-line (so the logs were not growing
while I was working) and copy them off to subfolders.
