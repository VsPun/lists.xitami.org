I've just stared at the source a little, and it seems that you can't
control what the supervisor does -- it seems to have the
two-weeks-is-plenty setting hard coded into it :-(

In which case, at present, you'll either have to disable the supervisor,
or you'll have to change the source.

According to the source the Xitami supervisor can be disabled by
setting:

[server] supervisor=0

(which appears to be the default setting, in at least some versions of
Xitami.)

If it isn't the default in your version, you should set it in
defaults.cfg; that's the only place it'll be noticed, as it's checked as
xitami is starting up.  (If that doesn't work try changing xitami.cfg as
well, but I suspect that won't make a difference.)

Sorry for the confusion -- you were on the right track after all.  It
_should_ be possible to configure how long the supervisor keeps things
around though.
