<PRE>&gt;<i> who 192.168.0.2 is. ... That is an internal LAN address of the machine
</I>that xitami is running on.

Duh! That's right, that range is often used for internal private IP
numbers, normally won't pass through routers, and certainly won't pass
from USC to you (unless you are on the USC campus). So the apparent
connection to USC is bogus. (I wonder how much excess load their DNS
server gets for overlapping a private range.)

Is it likely that your machine 192.168.0.2 accessed your Xitami server?
If so, and if RDNS has gotten enabled, all is OK. The bogus attempt to
ask USC for DNS look-up on your private-range IP number is awkward, but
I'm sure they are used to it. (Maybe that's why &quot;packet size error&quot;:
maybe when their machine sees a bogus private-IP look-up, they drop the
connection ASAP.) You could run your own inside DNS server that handled
inside queries in the 192.168.0.XXX range and passed others to an
outside DNS server, but that's a lot of work just to avoid entries in
the console log. 

&gt;<i> Does this mean they are looking me up?  
</I>
No, that would be logged in your DNS server's logs. And it sounds like
you don't run your own DNS.

Anyway, since it is appearing in Xitami's console, it means Xitami is
looking-up 192.168.0.2. Which probably means you have RDNS enabled. 

If you basically don't want RDNS (you normally don't): In the web-admin
screen, Logging, just above &quot;Debug reverse DNS queries&quot;,  look at
&quot;Translate IP addresses?&quot;. You probably want this NOT checked. Below
that, &quot;DNS servers - primary[secondary]:&quot; you probably do NOT want this
to be a real DNS server (the default 127.0.0.1 is bogus and should foil 
all RDNS).
