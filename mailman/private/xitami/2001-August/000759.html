<PRE>Hello Ewen,

EM&gt; Xitami 2.5b1 and Xitami 2.5b2 (IIRC) had some problems with posted data,
EM&gt; full stop.  I didn't catch what version he was using, but if it is one
EM&gt; of those (or the &quot;2.5b4&quot; NT service version which was actually 2.5b1
EM&gt; internally due to build issues) then using either 2.4d9 or 2.5b5 may help.

EM&gt; Other than that I'm not aware of any problems with Win2K.

I'm using 2.4d9 which I downloaded a few days back from your site.

I've since installed Apache and it works fine with these same PHP scripts.

I would like to go back to Xitami but don't have much time to spend
trying to get this resolved.
