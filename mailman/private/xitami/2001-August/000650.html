Have you pondered the legality of modifying someone else's computer 
without their consent?   Wouldn't you be suspect for damages, real or 
imagined?  

Some people are going to be really po'd when they discover they have to 
reformat everything on their local network.  As very few good deeds go 
unpunished, I don't think I want them looking in my direction.  

Also, I don't see that you've removed the backdoor or other backdoors 
that may have also arrived.  Would you further help these people by 
reformatting their computer remotely?  Surely you realize that hackers 
are applying their own automated routines but for other purposes?

The people to help is Microsoft.  At first I thought that everyone should 
relay all these gazillions of daily hits to them so they will learn to be 
more responsible than to default bug-ridden internet software in the next 
os.   On second thought I suspect that giant armies of slaved machines 
are probably getting ready to do just  that ~ and worse.
