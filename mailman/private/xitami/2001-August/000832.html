<PRE>I did it!  PHP is installed in collaboration with Xitami and my Win32 
box!!!  But, what would my success be worth if I didn't share the 
steps and Xitami foibles with all of you who are equally puzzled! :)

1.  Xitami, in combination with PHP (and perhaps a fair bit of my 
own human error) requires that any virtual directory be named 
exactly as the name of the file folder in which that particular 
website is stored.  For instance, a site folder at c:\greene_find_out 
cannot be registered with a virtual host name of greene.  It must be 
greene_find_out.  That was the cause of my problems all along!

2.  The way I discovered this malfunction (some of which is 
probably mine.... along with poorly written documentation) was to 
change the php.ini line that reads this:
error_log=

to this:
error_log=c:\xitami\php_error.txt

This will create a log file named php_error.txt in your Xitami 
directory.  Every time something goes wrong during the 
instantiation of PHP, it will append the error report to this file.

I hope this helps others who are having problems installing PHP.  I 
apologize if my explanation is scattered.  It is late in the evening, 
and I have been agonising over installing PHP for the past 24 
hours.... and that's one obsession I can do without! :)

Sincerely,
Brad Smith,
