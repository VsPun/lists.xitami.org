<PRE>1) I have installed xitami only to test cgi perl scripts and I got a
bug/crash message recently which I sent to xitami as the crash message
told me.

Since I do not do any configuring or monitoring of it, I forgot my user
name and password and even though I wrote them down, can't find them
now.  What to do?

2) What was happening when the message of a crash came was testing my
scripts which use input from user forms.  I tried putting in a long
string of characters (like 300) to see if the text would wrap and they
didn't.  I could not figure out how to make this happen even after
consulting the perl documentation.

Does anyone know how to put in a few (like 2) simple lines in cgi script
to output info from database to browser with text wrapped? I tried
tables and I tried setting the form input to WRAP=&quot;hard.&quot;  Nothing
works.
