<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Connect to : 207.69.188.186 () port 53
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Request ip address 192.168.0.2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an ordinary DNS look-up. The 207.69.188.186 address is similar
</I>&gt;<i> to the one you used to mail your note, so I assume it is your ISP's DNS
</I>&gt;<i> server. Port 53 is in fact DNS service (I had to check). Xitami seems to
</I>&gt;<i> want to know who 192.168.0.2 is.
</I>
Thanks for the response.  That is an internal LAN address of the machine
that xitami is running on.  I'm not sure what xitami is looking for.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I understand the answer it gets, and I'm not sure Xitami
</I>&gt;<i> liked it. The &quot;packet size error&quot; is also odd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start of authority       blackhole.isi.edu
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW: <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/">http://www.isi.edu/</A> is the engineering school at The University of
</I>&gt;<i> Southern California. They say they've been around since the 1870s, and
</I>&gt;<i> have had a quarter million students. So the organization is legit, but
</I>&gt;<i> who knows what those engineering students are doing. The odd DNS results
</I>&gt;<i> may just mean that someone plugged in a laptop in the Lab.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I had looked them up before also.  OK, I guess I'll really have to prove my
ignorance here.  Does this mean they are looking me up?  What exactly is
going on?

&gt;<i> Why is Xitami doing DNS look-ups? There IS an option to do that, but we
</I>&gt;<i> generally leave it turned off because it is very slow. Maybe you enabled
</I>&gt;<i> it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't see the option for turning on DNS look-ups.  I do have an option set
for &quot;Debug reverse DNS queries.&quot;   Is this the one you mean?  &quot;Allow
recursive queries&quot; is also checked.
