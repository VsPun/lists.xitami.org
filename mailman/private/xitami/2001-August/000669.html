You have psychological damage from a worm that poses you no danger 
other than a few hundred entries in your logs each day?  You are living 
through history in the making ~ relax and enjoy it for what it is.

True.  But if you printed t-shirts, bumper stickers and pencils with the 
entire default.ida buffer hit printed on them you would get smiles (and 
maybe a little spending money) from people all over the world.  Just don't 
sell the stuff in Redmond, Washington.
