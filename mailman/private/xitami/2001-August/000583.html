Which statistic is not incompatible with John's guess, in that there are
so many more Windoze machines deployed world-wide that their 18% of
breaches result in the infection of far more individual systems than all
the bugs in other less-widely deployed systems.

And as for &quot;the world wanting M$ products&quot;, that's only the case because
they manage to con more PHBs into buying their crapware.  Interesting to
see that The Sunday Times is now embarking on an anti-M$ crusade.

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
