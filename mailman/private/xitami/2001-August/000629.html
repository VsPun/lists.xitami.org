<PRE>Michael,

Thanks very much for the response.  &quot;World-famous&quot; might be a little
optimistic :)  Hope you liked the book.  I have been experimenting with
luring a name or address out of this person.  I added a message board, some
comment areas, stuff like that.  What I would really like to do is configure
Xitami to pop up a login screen just for that IP address.  Is there any way
to do that?

Jill

ps How did you know I played the cello?

</I>&gt;<i> If you were the world-famous author I'd say use &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; but you
</I>&gt;<i> might be someone else.  ;D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are far more weird people in the world then there is time to track
</I>&gt;<i> them down.  If the information and images are too revealing you may
</I>&gt;<i> want to tone the site down a little until the &quot;stalker&quot; gets bored and
</I>&gt;<i> leaves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There could be some rational and totally non-weird reason for their
</I>&gt;<i> behavior you haven't thought of.   You might just have your first
</I>&gt;<i> groupie!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they have a static ip you might try searches (esp google) for
</I>&gt;<i> the ip as
</I>&gt;<i> this sometimes appears in some listings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Put in comment areas, esp in places the lurker frequents.  Gather
</I>&gt;<i> information as it's amazing how far you can get on just a little
</I>&gt;<i> information.  If they play an instrument, such as a cello, they are
</I>&gt;<i> probably listed in a music directory somewhere.  My oldest daughter, a
</I>&gt;<i> budding geneologist, can track down nearly anyone but without a huge
</I>&gt;<i> budget she needs more than just an ip.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, change your website around.  Keep the root level clean without
</I>&gt;<i> links and change the directory names for areas you'd prefer to keep
</I>&gt;<i> more  private.  If the lurker quickly finds their way into the
</I>&gt;<i> private areas,
</I>&gt;<i> you know to look within close circles or co-workers.
