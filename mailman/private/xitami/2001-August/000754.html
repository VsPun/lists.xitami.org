TJH&gt; I never liked this about PHP (or at least I could never figure it out), but
TJH&gt; the HTTP_POST_VARS hash is a bit strange.  Basically, your variables are
TJH&gt; converted from the hash into normal variables:

TJH&gt; phpinfo() shows something like this -
TJH&gt; HTTP_POST_VARS[&quot;MyVariable&quot;] = MyValue
TJH&gt; MyVariable = MyValue

TJH&gt; Referencing it like this doesn't work as expected:
TJH&gt; if ($HTTP_POST_VARS[&quot;MyVariable&quot;] == &quot;MyValue&quot;)
TJH&gt; {
TJH&gt; }

TJH&gt; However, referencing it like this does:
TJH&gt; if ($MyVariable == &quot;MyValue&quot;)
TJH&gt; {
TJH&gt; }

The PHP code I'm try to get working is w-agora www.w-agora.net and it
uses the if ($MyVariable == &quot;MyValue&quot;)syntax. As you probably know
this is controlled by: register_globals=On in php.ini

I also tried: if (isSet($HTTP_POST_VARS[&quot;do_setup&quot;])) which doesn't
work.

There was an earlier post to the mail list by &quot;Richard Blazek&quot;
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:rwb@altavista.net">rwb@altavista.net</A>&gt; who indicated he had this problem on W2K, but W98
worked fine. I've not tried W98 yet.

I am an absolute newbie at PHP however, but I'm reasonably sure I have
everything setup correctly.

&gt;&gt;<i>I've searched the archives and have seen a few other people mention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>this problem but haven't seen any solutions posted. I've waisted best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>part of a day on this and it is driving me nuts. Xitami looks good,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but if I can't get this resolved quickly I guess I'll move to Apache.
</I>
TJH&gt; Apache is horribly unstable under Windows with PHP (especially with
TJH&gt; mod-ssl).  I wasted an entire week re-building that piece of junk from
TJH&gt; scratch using every option possible (I personally would write my own web
TJH&gt; server if I had a choice between that and Apache - it's a good thing Xitami
TJH&gt; exists).  Just thought you would like a heads-up.

I'm only using this on a PC for development. If its a little flaky I
can cope. The real thing runs on my Web server which is a Unix box
running Apache. 

&gt;&gt;<i>On another note why haven't the Archived Mailing lists been updated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for many months?
</I>
TJH&gt; Check the headers of this post for links to the new archives.

Can't work out what you mean here?

TJH&gt; Hope this helps!

Nope, but I greatly appreciate your reply none the less.
