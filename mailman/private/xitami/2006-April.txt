Subject: [Xitami] Refresh not refreshing
Message-ID: <001201c65518$ad83cd30$6401a8c0@p4>

I am running version 2.5C2 and have written a cgi program so users can enter a protected area by adding their username and password to the defaults.aut file via a form page. After a new entry is added though, I have to manually restart the server for it to take effect. Apparently, Xitami's refresh is not working, no matter what I set the value to. I even did a fresh install of Xitami on another computer, and gave it a try without adding any new configuration and it still doesn't work. I am using Windows XP Pro on an Intel machine. Has anyone else had this problem or heard anything about it ? I have been using Xitami succesfully for several years now, and this is the first time I ran into something that couldn't be fixed by a reconfiguration........ Any ideas whatsoever or "try this" will be highly appreciated..... Jim Reynolds

It's a pretty common problem that the refresh by default every 60 seconds 
does not take as it should.
You need to either find a way to invoke a shutdown of the xigui32.exe or 
service if ran as such, then restart the service or open xigui32.exe again.

I could toss a simple two line thing together if you're interested.

Hello,
   
  At 2:00 this morning, for the observation of Daylight Savings Time, my system clock automatically sprung ahead 1 hour... crashing Xitami in the process.
   
  This is the third year in a row that Xitami has crashed when the time has rolled forward for DST, yet never seems to have a problem later in the season when the clock finally falls back.
   
  I'd like to know if anyone else has this problem... and if anyone knows of any tweaks that might help prevent this from happening again next year.
   
  I run Xitami under XP-Pro SP-2, on a stand-alone PC, and almost never see anything crash, as long as I remember to reboot the machine every seven or eight days.
   
  Thanks,
  Rod

My Xitami never crashes, which can't be said for my windows box that reboots randomly.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami SSL Configuration
Message-ID: <000201c65699$d5dfd940$0200a8c0@chaos>

Hi all.  I have been an avid user of Xitami for several years now.  I have
rarely run into problems with it.  A while back, was planning on setting up
an SSL section to run a small store using perl.  The military ended up
having me deploy, so I never got around to completing this setup.

 

I have reloaded my server, and recovered from crashes, and reinstalled from
backups countless times (normally due to my own mistakes).  I have Xitami
Pro, v2.5c2, but I don't think I have any of the SSL configuration files, or
even a copy so I can modify one.

 

In my server settings, under Advanced, I have one checkbox that says Enable
SSL Interface? Which is checked, of course, and the box underneath that has
the configuration file to use, which right now has sslhttp.cfs in it.

 

I don't have such a file, and if I were to make one, I have no idea what
format to make the configuration file.  If you can help me build this file,
I think I can then set up the SSL side of my server.

 

Any information to help me fix this would help.  Thanks.

Same config as you, but I turned off all logs except error logging and 
console logging.
I have not had a crash, on that time but three times in the days after due 
to some load issues.

I think, guessing wildly here, that it has to do with the logging again.

Yes.  However, it's been a long time since I purchased my copy, so I'm sure
the full tech support has expired.   I am hoping I can still get assistance
with setting this up, as I never really had the chance to get it working in
the first place.

"Random reboots" of Windows is an indicator of automatic rebooting upon 
a Blue-Screen-of-Death (BSOD).  You can check for this by disabling this 
option:

1)  Right-click on "My Computer".
2)  Select "Properties".
3)  "Advanced" tab.
4)  Click the "Startup & Recovery"'s "Settings" button.
5)  Uncheck the "Automatic Restart" checkbox.
6)  Click 'OK' a bunch of times.
7)  Wait patiently for the system to crash.
8)  Record the "STOP" message and the 4 series of hex digits that follow.
9)  Search Google for the _exact_ STOP message.
10)  Look for a link to MSDN Library (msdn.microsoft.com) for 
information on the STOP error.

HINT:  I had a similar problem (would reboot even on boot up) until I 
upgraded to WinXP.  I quickly found out that the problem was related to 
some really ancient drivers for a piece of ancient hardware that I 
always installed on every machine I've ever owned.  Old hardware and 
Win2000 (or newer) don't mix.  Win2000 has a harder time figuring out 
which device is causing the actual problem than WinXP does.

When you got the Pro version it came with configuration files and
certificates, which you need in order to get the SSL layer working. 
You should unpack the original package you downloaded again, if you
can find it.

Subject: [Xitami] Xitami SSL Configuration
Message-ID: <000901c65699$8ef90fb0$0200a8c0@chaos>

Hi all.  I have been an avid user of Xitami for several years now.  I have
rarely run into problems with it.  A while back, was planning on setting up
an SSL section to run a small store using perl.  The military ended up
having me deploy, so I never got around to completing this setup.

 

I have reloaded my server, and recovered from crashes, and reinstalled from
backups countless times (normally due to my own mistakes).  I have Xitami
Pro, v2.5c2, but I don't think I have any of the SSL configuration files, or
even a copy so I can modify one.

 

In my server settings, under Advanced, I have one checkbox that says Enable
SSL Interface? Which is checked, of course, and the box underneath that has
the configuration file to use, which right now has sslhttp.cfs in it.

 

I don't have such a file, and if I were to make one, I have no idea what
format to make the configuration file.  If you can help me build this file,
I think I can then set up the SSL side of my server.

 

Any information to help me fix this would help.  Thanks.

 

Matthew Jones

Just for the record,

Daylight savings crashed mine as well.

I run an identical config to the one mentioned below... and also maintain an exact mirror (the static stuff at least) on a WinME machine at an alternate location.  Daylight savings crashed BOTH.

It's most likely what happened to Dwayne as well, who posted a crash report on Sunday:

[QUOTE]
Abort at SMTPIPE:Reload-Pipes-If-Changed: (After-Waking, Timer-Event)
[/UNQUOTE]

As someone already mentioned, it most likely has something to do with logging.  That makes sense to me.

Now, while I'm on the topic of logs, I'd really appreciate someone suggesting an edit that may prevent Xitami from auto-deleting aged logs.  I personally like to keep my logs for extended periods, and delete them manually, when "i" decide that I no longer have a use for them.  Thanks.

Create (or edit if it already exists) a defaults.aut in the Xitami
directory (c:\xitami\ )

In it make sure there is a section
[/admin]
  userid = "password"

Where userid and password are what you want them to be. If you copy
precisely these two lines into your defaults.aut then you can access
the admin panel by
http://userid:password@localhost/admin/

I have just downloaded xitami and gotten it configured - I hope
correctly - on my W2K professional system. I've installed PERL as well.
I put a PERL  .PL in c:\xitami\cgi-bin and tried running it by using my
IE browser to run it. 
 
I'm sure the program runs as it creates three directories like it's
supposed to, but I can't get the HTML to display the web page that it
produces. Am I doing something wrong or ???
 
Thank you for any suggestions on what I should be looking for/at.

Without a touch more information - e.g.the perl script or critical
portions of it - its going to be hard to answer your question.

My on;y other suggestion would be to try running one the the CGI.pm
example scripts -
http://search.cpan.org/src/LDS/CGI.pm-3.17/examples/index.html - and
see if it works as it should.

are you certain the perl script is running all the way through?  put this as
your second line (after #!/perl/bin./perl), it will push all run time errors
to the browser:

use CGI::Carp qw/fatalsToBrowser/;

have you tested the basic "hello world" script to verify even the most
simple of perl scripts works via the browser?

Create (or edit if it already exists) a defaults.aut in the Xitami
directory (c:\xitami\ )

In it make sure there is a section
[/admin]
  userid = "password"

Where userid and password are what you want them to be. If you copy
precisely these two lines into your defaults.aut then you can access
the admin panel by
http://userid:password@localhost/admin/

It's a Perl script that creates several directories and also produces
output which I want to show up in a browser. When I run it under DOS,
the directories get created and it runs and displays the HTML code in
the DOS window. When I try to run it in the browser window by using
"http://localhost/xitami/cgi-bin/auction.pl" it pops up a dos window,
the code sort of flashes by and the dos window closes. It's as though
the HTML code somehow never "calls" or gets "piped into" the browser so
that it runs in the browser. When I run the code on a Unix/Apache system
on my ISP it works fine. I just can't seem to get the output of the PERL
program (the HTML code..) to show up in the browser. I'm new at this and
I think I'm missing a step somewhere with getting it to run on a W2k
system...  I've read as much as I can find on this problem but nothing
seems to address what I need to do. Perl works, the admin console says
Xitami is working, but I cant' get the output to show up in my
browser....

Without a touch more information - e.g.the perl script or critical
portions of it - its going to be hard to answer your question.

My on;y other suggestion would be to try running one the the CGI.pm
example scripts -
http://search.cpan.org/src/LDS/CGI.pm-3.17/examples/index.html - and
see if it works as it should.

Are you newbie to perl, or just Xitami?  If new to perl, why not use PHP
instead?
 
I know, not what you asked, but was just wondering.
 
For xitami, you can either set up a filter to run perl or php cgi scripts or
put them in a directory that contains "cgi-bin" . By putting them in the
"cgi-bin" directory xitami will try to execute it.
 
Here is a link to the documentation for cgi
http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index5.htm
 
Or you can do it with filters. For example to run php programs I put this in
my defaults.cfg file: If you don't have a defaults.cfg. Make one in the
Xitami base directory. Mine is "C:\xitami"
[Filter]
    .php = "C:\\php\\php-cgi.exe"
 
For perl use
[Filter]
    .pl = "C:\\perl\\perl.exe"
 
Note the TWO backslashes. adjust the filters to point to whreever you
installed your perl.exe to.
 
Here is the documentation on the filters section:
http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index4.htm#TOC34
 
You should also be able to execute scripts from a command prompt using
"perl somescript.pl" (I think) The output will go to your screen. When
Xitami runs it,  it will capture the output and send it back to the broswer
that requested it.

There isn't anything special needed. Just install perl and make sure
that you add per to the path - generally speaking taking the default
location(s) works better than customizing but I can't see it failing
even then. I assume you are using activestate perl. If so there really
are no other majic things to do. It would be good to install the HTML
manuals but it sin't compulsory. If you do this then adding an alias
of
perl="c:\perl\html"
to your Xitami settings is noce because it allows you to read the perl
manual from http://localhost/perl/ but it isn't a must do merely a
nice addition

Then use the sample CGI I sent earlier today to test and see if Xitami
fins perl. Ignore the fact that perl is not (on windows) at
/usr/bin/perl.

There really isn't anyhting else to it.

Thank you! The example that you gave worked as did the examples on the
page that you recommended.
It's now obvious that the problem is in the code in the program so I
need to start digging in that.
I really appreciate your suggestions and help in narrowing down the
problem area!!

the spawning of a second window makes me wonder whether you are
running the perl script direct or calling it from soemthign else (a
batch file?).

I've done a lot of troubleshooting in my time and this dounds like a
case where the best approach is to start with a known working script
(e.g. my example.cgi)  and pasteing in ever larger portions of your
non-working script until the "doh"/"eureka" moment (depending on your
mood) strikes and you see where the problem is

Subject: [Xitami] Perl/cgi/php
Message-ID: <003c01c659d7$61428d30$b432d00c@wmircnet>

when i do get the programs to work with the url then they only prompt me to download the file but does not open a page. I followed the instructions also and was again prompted to download the file instead of getting a page.

E.g. create a file called example.cgi in your cgi/bin directory with
the following contents and see if http://localhost/cgi-bin/example.cgi
produces displayable HTML or a blank screen
------- start of example.cgi ---
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use CGI qw(:standard);

print header;
print start_html('A Simple Example'),
    h1('A Simple Example'),end_html;
------- end of example.cgi ---

(note this file works on my Xitami/Windows/Perl setup just fine).

If it does the same thing (window/blank html) then we probably need a
dump of your environment to figure out what is going wrong ...

Message-ID: <1c33a90a0604190758m1f38c0dbxe48d9c0d0cd8fe17@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,
I've been put in charge of making an Xitami work.  It is running on a
virtual machine with a local IP address (192.168.10.2), and it's
mother host is using Apache's mod_proxy to forward requests from the
outside to Xitami, then send Xitami's response back to the world.
The problem I'm having is that, in Xitami-generated Location: headers,
it is using it's IP address (192.168.10.2) instead of it's hostname
(fs.example.com).  I have set up it's hostname in xitami.cfg and I
have set the computer's hostname to the same.
We are not using any sort of virtual hosting and (as far as I know)
the config is pretty much stock.
Any help would be much appreciated.

Your DNS server should route the traffic
your Xitami should be on a machine on the outside of your fire walled 
router or a DMZ machine
Then you can skip the double router step of the apache hack.
All IP to Domain name is routed through, say BIND 9.3 or different DNS 
solutions only.
Xitami only handles Virtual host routes on that same IP to specific 
directed domains, still routed with DNS albeit virtual.

I'm not quite sure what you're saying.
We only have one external IP address, which is being used by a primay
site (hosted by Apache).
The secondary site, hosted by Xitami, is on a LAN.  We can not put it
any farther out because we do not have another IP address and I do not
want to put a Windows machine right on the Internet.
The problem lies with the Location header.
When a directory is requested with out the trailing slash (eg:
example.com/foo instead of example.com/foo/), Xitami does what it
should and sends a 302 moved temporally header, trying to redirect the
client to /foo/.  The problem is that the Location: used by Xitami is
it's IP address, NOT the host supplied by the browser (as, I believe,
it should be).
Here is what the transaction looks like:

Browser:
GET /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: xitami.example.com

Xitami:
HTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporarily
Vary: Host
Location: http://192.168.1.2/foo/

But this is what it should say:
HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently
Location: http://xitami.example.com/foo/

I hope this clarifies things.

You need to tell your internal DNS that xitami.example.com is
192.168.1.2 and tell your apache server to redirect to
xitami.example.com not to 192.168.1.2

What I don't understand is why you would need two different servers to 
route a virtual host?
Well then I understand your case a bit better and it would be as the 
previous caller said, reroute the signal by an internal DNS server.

And this is the part I hate: When I get baffled by something so stupidly simple.
You were very right: I was assuming that Apache would pass the Host:
header along to the IP address it was contacting.  I guess not.  When
I told it to connect to xitami.example.com (which, internally, points
to 192.168.1.2) everything seems to work fine.

As far as the setup goes, we have one Linux server (that is horribly
over loaded).  It provides Internet to about 30 computers, runs an
Apache server for our external page and runs a virtual machine (with
VMWare) to run Windows.  We need Windows+Xitami because there are a
couple apps written in Perl for Xitami+Windows that don't like to run
on Linux at all (and wading through 10,000 lines of Perl which was
written by a non-programmer is not my idea of fun).

Anyway, it all seems to be working well now.
Thanks again for the help,
David

Hi,

I am using Xitami version 2.5b4 as my web server on Windows XP
professional version 2002. 

I found that my documents - PDF files are downloaded automatically to a
machine which user uses to view them online. Is there any way that can
block the downloading? 

Any help would be much appreciated.

Some attempts to block such downloads can only be done in HTML code with 
the pragma meta tag for NOCHACHE however it doesn't work really well 
because of how different browsers read the code.

The best protection from download, is to not put the documents in the 
public directory at all.
If you need them online for your internal use, try keeping a copy only in a 
password protected folder and not in the public path.

When you do the installation of Xitami it automatically creates a folder in 
the WEBFOLDER directory called PRIVATE
This is password protected.

I have note made use of it myself as I use different techniques that are 
more or less hidden from Xitami even, but study the user manual for 
password and security settings for this folder and you will find out how to 
do it.


You should be able to define a sub folder for this folder for each 
individual user you wish to grant specific access, and simply specify in 
the defaults.cfg or xitami.cfg and related aut files how users usernames 
and passwords are related to certain sub directories.

I hope this helps you a bit on the way.

The whole process is dcescribed in the Xitami manual -

hmmm...

i'm not sure i understand the question correctly, but if you're leaving
files in public-facing directories on your server, they can and will be
accessed by whomever happens to stumble by, (whether they be human or
robot).

if these files are of a personal or critical nature, i might suggest that
you password protect the directories in which they reside... and assign
username/password combos, only to those you've authorized access.

hope this helps... but if i've completely misunderstood your question, feel
free to delete me... as i'm sure one of the others will be along shortly
with better solutions.

assuming that an "aut" file already exists for the domain in question,
it can be edited like so:

[/your-directory-name/sub-path/etc]
    username01 = "password1"
    username02 = "password2"
    username03 = "password3"

... and so on

i don't believe there's any other trickery involved.

Does it mean that webmaster has to edit the file manually? Is there any way which let users to create their own id and password?

Some attempts to block such downloads can only be done in HTML code with the pragma meta tag for NOCHACHE however it doesn't work really well because of how different browsers read the code. 

The best protection from download, is to not put the documents in the public directory at all.
If you need them online for your internal use, try keeping a copy only in a password protected folder and not in the public path.

I am running Xitami on a win2000 machine. I am having difficulty with SSI.

Although SSI is enabled in the configuration page, it does not pick up 
the file and include it (although some of the commands like when the 
file was last updated do work). I would like to continue using Xitami 
locally to check my website development (it works well with 
php/mysql/perl) but I am stumped as to why this simple server function 
is not working.

Any help would be appreciated.

Stilman Davis

Not at all? or just not all of it? there is a bug that means that
large files (over about 30k) get truncated. I reported it years ago
but it is unlikely to be fixed because rewriting the routine where the
SSI file is read in would be extreme.

You should be able to test basic SSI include in the the standard
Xitami page - http://localhost/testssi.ssi - including IIRC file
include

Also Xitami has to be refreshed after each edit to the aut file if I remember correctly from discussion a few weeks ago. This does pose a problem if a cgi program is used to write to the aut file directly.

assuming that an "aut" file already exists for the domain in question,

it can be edited like so:

    username01 = "password1"

Subject: [Xitami] Error on .shtml pages!
Message-ID: <44482C33.4070500@whiteshepherd.net>

I'm running Xitami 2.4.9d  (I've tried newer some versions but they 
crash when displaying a perl CGI page that is too large, don't know if 
that is fixed yet?).  Anyways I run Xitami and Apache2 on the same 
machine seperated by hosting IP.  Static websites that get real heavy 
traffic I put on Xitami as the server is under a heavy load.  The 
problem is some of these sites have .shtml files.  When running under 
Xitami, when it hits these .shtml files it just gives an error page:


  Internal error: your request was unsuccessful
  Cannot create CGI process - program not found


However these same .shtml files run fine under Apache2.  Any idea why 
this can't run under Xitami?  I will post one of these .shtml files 
below for reference. Thanks for any help!

You have two SSI includes in the page. /ssi/ssiLinks.txt and
/ssi/ssiChooseStyle.txt I imagine that is the problem

Francis,

Thank you for your reply. Even the 1kb testssi.ssi does not work 
correctly, it truncates, leaving off the final footer. I guess I will 
just have to go live to another server to check any SSI out.

Thank you for putting me out of my misery.

Yours sincerely,
Stilman Davis

Dear Francis,

Following on from my previous problem.

I was hoping to be able to put a number of includes on a page. Is this 
not possible with the xitami server?
I will have to look into another server, probably sort out a linux box 
to test my pages locally.

Regards,
Stilman Davis

It has been possible -- which version were you using? If not the 2.4 
branch, you should try it, because my experiences with 2.5 (beta 
versions!) have been horrible.

Apache can run on Windows, and I run the combination in live 
environments. At this point in time, Xitami is only good for very 
lightweight servers (low resource usage) and applications where 
extremely speedy delivery of static pages is desired.

I have tried it. The PDF file is password protected but still is downloaded to local machine. Is there any other method to let user view file only without downloading it to local machine?

assuming that an "aut" file already exists for the domain in question,

it can be edited like so:

    username01 = "password1"

If a browser displays a PDF then it has been downloaded. There may
possibly be some Adobe PDF DRM options that stop a PDF from being
saved - I haven't looked at the Adobe DRM for a while - but in any
case this isn't a Xitami problem because the same thing happens with
any web server

If you want to (say) display only a summary page or two then you have
to use soem tools to create one or two page PDFs or text documents
that you display and then say somehting like login to download. You
cna of course also limit these logins via IP address so that not
everyone can log in.

I did find the problem.  My shebang line (first line) in the perlssi 
(file in xitami) needed to point to my perl.exe file.  All SSI seems to 
be working now.

I have had good luck splitting tasks between Xitami and Apache under 
win2k3 (millions of small static hits will produce a much smaller load 
on Xitami) as well as better Perl performance (for some reason) runs 
MUCH better on Xitami where PHP runs better under Apache2.  However I 
cannot get good stability on CGI past my Xitami 2.4 .  I'd like to use 
the features in 2.5 but I'll need to wait for some CGI fixes first.

i have a handful of web-masters on my xitami service (all windows users),
who regularly upload entire folder-loads of web-content (drag and drop), to
their own 'uniquely assigned' web-space directories, via ftp.

this all seems to work well, but i'm constantly coming behind them, cleaning
up and deleting useless (windows generated) "thumbs.db" files by the
hundreds, which are strewn about the entire file-system, in scattered
locations throughout.  they are a general nuisance really, and a complete
waste of good resources, especially if they wind up getting indexed by
search robots.  some robots will continue checking back for "thumbs.db"
files repeatedly, even months after they've been deleted.

because "thumbs.db" is a hidden windows file, most of my users aren't even
aware they exist... which makes it extremely difficult for some of them to
understand exactly what they are, where they've come from, how they've
become mixed with their web-site content, or why their existence so often
generates various errors as they attempt to manipulate files on the server.

 - is there a way to set up a filter in xitami, which will prevent any files
by the name of "thumbs.db" from being uploaded?

and if so:

 - can it be set up to function transparently, so the user is never aware
that any filtering or roll-off has taken place?

an example of such an edit, would be kindly appreciated,
thank you.

Interesting problem...are you using Xitami FTP or a different FTP server?  Are you certain this isn't an FTP server issue and not a windows issue?  I know that HTTP file uploading generates temp files in the windows designated temp folder (typicially: c:\temp ) What kind of files are being loaded - images? Does it matter the file type?  Can you force this "thumbs.db" file to a specific location.

To be honest, I haven't heard of anything like this before, other than the HTTP upload temp files, thus is the reason I think that this is an ftp server issue.

If the user is going to see the PDF it will be downloaded one way or another
it may go to cache but it's still downloaded so a savy user could grab the
file out of cache if all else failed. I don't know of a way to view the file
from the server without downloading it. Maybe there is some sort of PDF
viewer I don't know. Maybe check out HYPERLINK
"http://www.pdfgo.com/"http://www.pdfgo.com/ see if that will do it for you.

Also Xitami has to be refreshed after each edit to the aut file if I
remember correctly from discussion a few weeks ago. This does pose a problem
if a cgi program is used to write to the aut file directly.

for the example i've provided,

the "aut" file must be edited manually by the administrator...  it's the
only way i know.
 

if you're looking for something more elaborate than that, i might suggest
browsing some of the free cgi sites to see if you can find a specific script
to suit your needs.

 

(unless someone else here has a better solution)

assuming that an "aut" file already exists for the domain in question,

it can be edited like so:

 

[/your-directory-name/sub-path/etc]
    username01 = "password1"
    username02 = "password2"
    username03 = "password3" 

 

... and so on

 

i don't believe there's any other trickery involved.

If I understand you correctly you want people to be able to view these
PDFs but when someone clicks a link to one their browser prompts them
to download it instead of displaying the file. If that is the case
there are a few things to review.

1) The server needs to be setup with the correct MIME type. See
http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index4.htm#TOC45
The proper MIME type for PDF is application/pdf
Without that most browsers with the exception of IE on Windows (and
possibly Mac) will try to download the file becuase they don't know
what it is.
2) The browser viewing the site must have the ability to view PDFs.
This is a plug-in that is optionally installed when you install the
Adobe Reader on your computer and most browsers do not have it
installed. Modern browser if supplied the correct MIME type will
usually ask the user if they would like to attempt to open the file in
the appropriate file viewer though.

I hope that clarifies things a bit.  :)

hmmm...
    perhaps i should explain "thumbs.db", and how (and where) it's
originating.

i'm not sure what version of windows first introduced the thumbnail view of
images within win-explorer (as an alternative to standard file icons), but
it's this exact feature which creates and makes use of the "thumbs.db" files
i describe.

for example, if you're viewing the contents of a folder in explorer, then
reach up to the "view" menu and select "thumbnail"... the icons for all
common graphics-types, will instantly become thumbnails-images.  some
windows users simply keep their folder-view settings adjusted this way right
across the board...  i believe, it may actually be the default
folder-view with fresh windows installs.  (it's something that i always turn
off immediately)

regardless...  the moment that a windows user switches to the
thumbnail-view, "thumbs.db" (a hidden system file) gets created within that
folder... and acts as a thumbnail cache of sorts, so windows doesn't have to
keep re-building the thumbnails each time the folder is viewed.

(each and every folder will have it's own "thumbs.db" file, if/when
applicable.)

it means that someone could easily have one folder with five jpeg images in
it... and only be able to see a total of 5 files... but in actual fact,
there are 6 (if you include the hidden "thumbs.db").

if that entire folder (or a select-all of it's contents) is uploaded to my
(xitami-only) server via ftp, *all six files will transfer* during the
upload session ("thumbs.db" included)... and not just the 5 which were
intended by the user.  these "thumbs.db" files aren't even visible to the
user until after they've been uploaded... which causes most of them a great
deal of confusion, if and when they are found.

if a folder is dragged and dropped into an ftp-session, it makes sense to me
that all it's contents will be transferred with it, whether some of the
file-attributes are set to "hidden" or not.

this brings me back to my original question actually... because i feel if i
had a way to instruct xitami-ftp to simply disallow the upload of any file
by the name "thumbs.db", my problem would instantly be solved.

i clearly understand what these files are, and how they are being uploaded
by users on my system unintentionally... i just want to firewall them, if
that's at all possible.

sorry if i've bored most of you with my lengthily description... but would
really appreciate any advice that anyone here may be able to provide.

thanks again,

Ok, NOW I understand what you are referring to, the first email was a bit vague in the origins of the "thumbs.db" file.  So, the "thumbs.db" file are created locally on the users machine as hidden files and get uploaded during drag/drop FTP sessions and clutter up your server with useless, hidden files.

There are two ways to do this:
    1.  Filter and prevent "thumbs.db" from being uploaded, this most likely will require another FTP server.  Xitami's FTP server is a) not that reliable b) very outdated c) and doesn't provide you any effective filtering methods and d) is no longer supported.
    2.  Write an external script (perl/php/asp, etc) that combs your user and/or upload directories to find and delete the thumbs.db file.  Automate the runnning of the script by adding it to your "scheduled task" list.  Depending on the frequency of uploads, or the appearance of the thumbs.db file, I would run it at least once a day around 3am.

Other than that, I am not certain what to suggest.

Easier than that. It needs one line in a batch file, namely

@del d:\webroot\thumbs.db /s /as /ah /q

Save that as killthumbs.bat and run it through the scheduler or 
at.exe or in your preferred way.

heh, good call, didn't even think of using DOS commands:

@ = echo off
del switches:
    /s = delete file from all subdirectories of provided path
    /as = "A"ttrribute "S"ystem files
    /ah = "A"ttribute "H"idden files
    /q = quiet mode, do not ask for verification.

good idea.

    1.  Filter and prevent "thumbs.db" from being uploaded, this most likely will require another FTP server.  Xitami's FTP server is a) not that reliable b) very outdated c) and doesn't provide you any effective filtering methods and d) is no longer supported.
    2.  Write an external script (perl/php/asp, etc) that combs your user and/or upload directories to find and delete the thumbs.db file.  Automate the runnning of the script by adding it to your "scheduled task" list.  Depending on the frequency of uploads, or the appearance of the thumbs.db file, I would run it at least once a day around 3am.

Other than that, I am not certain what to suggest.

  hmmm...
      perhaps i should explain "thumbs.db", and how (and where) it's originating.

  i'm not sure what version of windows first introduced the thumbnail view of images within win-explorer (as an alternative to standard file icons), but it's this exact feature which creates and makes use of the " thumbs.db" files i describe.

  for example, if you're viewing the contents of a folder in explorer, then reach up to the "view" menu and select "thumbnail"... the icons for all common graphics-types, will instantly become thumbnails-images.  some windows users simply keep their folder-view settings adjusted this way right across the board...  i believe, it may actually be the default folder-view with fresh windows installs.  (it's something that i always turn off immediately) 

  regardless...  the moment that a windows user switches to the thumbnail-view, "thumbs.db" (a hidden system file) gets created within that folder... and acts as a thumbnail cache of sorts, so windows doesn't have to keep re-building the thumbnails each time the folder is viewed. 

  (each and every folder will have it's own "thumbs.db" file, if/when applicable.)

  it means that someone could easily have one folder with five jpeg images in it... and only be able to see a total of 5 files... but in actual fact, there are 6 (if you include the hidden "thumbs.db").

  if that entire folder (or a select-all of it's contents) is uploaded to my (xitami-only) server via ftp, all six files will transfer during the upload session ("thumbs.db" included)... and not just the 5 which were intended by the user.  these " thumbs.db" files aren't even visible to the user until after they've been uploaded... which causes most of them a great deal of confusion, if and when they are found.

  if a folder is dragged and dropped into an ftp-session, it makes sense to me that all it's contents will be transferred with it, whether some of the file-attributes are set to "hidden" or not.

  this brings me back to my original question actually... because i feel if i had a way to instruct xitami-ftp to simply disallow the upload of any file by the name "thumbs.db", my problem would instantly be solved. 

  i clearly understand what these files are, and how they are being uploaded by users on my system unintentionally... i just want to firewall them, if that's at all possible.

  sorry if i've bored most of you with my lengthily description... but would really appreciate any advice that anyone here may be able to provide.  

  thanks again,

  rick

    Interesting problem...are you using Xitami FTP or a different FTP server?  Are you certain this isn't an FTP server issue and not a windows issue?  I know that HTTP file uploading generates temp files in the windows designated temp folder (typicially: c:\temp ) What kind of files are being loaded - images? Does it matter the file type?  Can you force this " thumbs.db" file to a specific location.

    To be honest, I haven't heard of anything like this before, other than the HTTP upload temp files, thus is the reason I think that this is an ftp server issue.

    Subject: [Xitami] thumbs.db

     

    i have a handful of web-masters on my xitami service (all windows users), who regularly upload entire folder-loads of web-content (drag and drop), to their own 'uniquely assigned' web-space directories, via ftp.

    this all seems to work well, but i'm constantly coming behind them, cleaning up and deleting useless (windows generated) "thumbs.db" files by the hundreds, which are strewn about the entire file-system, in scattered locations throughout.  they are a general nuisance really, and a complete waste of good resources, especially if they wind up getting indexed by search robots.  some robots will continue checking back for " thumbs.db" files repeatedly, even months after they've been deleted.

    because "thumbs.db" is a hidden windows file, most of my users aren't even aware they exist... which makes it extremely difficult for some of them to understand exactly what they are, where they've come from, how they've become mixed with their web-site content, or why their existence so often generates various errors as they attempt to manipulate files on the server. 

     - is there a way to set up a filter in xitami, which will prevent any files by the name of "thumbs.db" from being uploaded?

    and if so:

     - can it be set up to function transparently, so the user is never aware that any filtering or roll-off has taken place?

    an example of such an edit, would be kindly appreciated,
    thank you.

    rick
