Slow moving or not, it's good to know that you're working on a new
incarnation. I'd be pretty lost without Xitami!

Subject: [Xitami] Hardware Upgrade Hell
Message-ID: <4A6AFEF2.7010800@relativedata.com>

I have been running classic xitami for years, but recenctly decided to 
upgrade my hardware.
But After the upgrade I'm getting isssues that I've never seen before.

Symptoms:
- my normal webpages are visible by visitors

- my cgis (these are c executables) return the error:


  Internal error: your request was unsuccessful
  Cannot create CGI process - program not found

They also leave empty .cgi .cgo pipe files in my c:\xitami directory

- my lrwp returns nothing to the user either but leave the following in 
my \xitami directory
1) a .lwo file that was generated by the app (it looks correct)
2) crash.log file that says:
abort at xilrwp : Send Peer Data to Xitami Wait for peer data block
I know my peer app is getting the xitami request. Its gui shows the 
request coming in.


I am running xitami 2.5 on XP home sp3 a fresh  install on this new 
hardware.
As far as I can see I am also using the exact same config files for 
xitami that used to work on the old hardware. (I copied and pasted them)

could this be casued by some recent microsoft patch to the OS?

Any ideas?

Thanks
