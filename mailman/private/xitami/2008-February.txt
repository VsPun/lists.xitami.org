Hi,

This is to announce the launch of a new wiki project for Xitami.

The site is currently at http://xitami.wikidot.com.

The goal is to migrate all existing documentation for Xitami to this
site and create a new place for the community of Xitami users.  As
many of you have told me, the old site is broken, links like
http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index.htm don't work any more.

When the site begins to take shape we'll move it to www.xitami.org and
archive the old site.

Right now, I'm looking for volunteers to help edit the site.  It's
really simple - it's a wiki - and all hands are welcome.

To join the wiki site, register on Wikidot and then join on
http://xitami.wikidot.com/system:join.

Is there going to be anyway to index all the old forum emails?...it would be 
awesome to have all the emails in a searchable database.  Too often I have 
questions that I find I am forced to ask b/c it there doesn't seem anyway to 
research the old emails for the answer.

I'd think it's better to write a new faq with some of the better
answers from the email list.

But that's a lot of work.  The old forum emails are all online, I
found the link and put it onto the wiki.

I assume there are ways to index these emails... Anyone ever done that?

Not really certain how to do it because of they are stored.  I am looking at 
the old emails now.  How are they currently stored?  It would seem to me 
they are already in a database b/c they are sortable by 
date/threat/subject/author - to me that implies a database must be needed. 
In addition, all the threads from a single topic are grouped together thus 
implying, again, that they are all in a db.  If that is the case I think it 
would be pretty simple to convert them into a searchable database or convert 
them to a typical forum layout we see with so many of the discussion group 
sites today.

One simple script should be sufficient to convert the whole list, assuming 
one knows all the parameters.

This example of January 08: 
http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/2008-January/thread.html

The first thread is titled "PHP and ASP inclusions for testing purposes", 
the next thread grouped with that first title is "Dynamic URL Conversion to 
static URLs".  The second is a different topic and is grouped together with 
the first topic....why?  Is it because the second topic had an article ID 
related to the first and the subject was simply changed?  And then further 
on down, still under that first subject is another grouping titled "Alias 
configs"...that third topic is different from the previous two group topics 
but yet its included in the grouping...again, why?  Knowing these answers 
will def help the script writer.

Also, what happens if an exchange about a thread carries over from one month 
to a new month....say Jan 30th it starts but doesn't finish til about Feb 
3rd.  Does that mean half the article is archived in Jan and half in 
Feb...or is the entire article grouping archived in one or the other months 
listings?

I guess these questions are typical for people wanting to convert
Mailman archives (we use Mailman as the software).

So logically, there'll be answers in the Mailman community.

No, actually not -- these archivers work by making lots of static HTML 
files (!). That is true (or at least, was) for the major mailing list 
archiver software too, namely Mhonarc. Mailman's internal archiver 
(Pipermail) seems to work that way too. I have been thinking of writing 
my own parsing scripts for some other mailing lists, it's probably 
workable to use in-reply-to and references headers to construct 
threading and put it in a database, but I'm lazy... ;-)

Actually a mail-to-database-converter would be like the holy grail for 
me, making it possible to actually construct a functional forum/mailing 
list combination, but I have never found any such scripts...

so every email is a unique, static html page?  I connected to the Index listing page which has all the months/years by thread/subject/author/date, is each sort option a unique and individual static webpage?  
 
Meaning the two following pages are in fact unique static webpages?  Or is there some kind of dynamic aliasing going on here that makes it appear to be seperate static web pages?
 
/pipermail/xitami/2007-December/thread.html
&
/pipermail/xitami/2007-December/subject.html 
 
Two things come to mind:
 
1: If the above is true, then the owner of the fileserver can easily write a script that parses the directories based on subject and then on date and time.  This will chronologically order all threads based on subject.  Process each file in order as a text file...grab the author, date, time, subject and content (new content...not older repeated content) and then store that info into a DB with assigned record IDs.  The first article of a grouping based on subject will the master recordID, all subsequent same subjected articles will use the maser recordID to associate with as a common thread.  When a new subject is processed then that means a new recordID must be assigned and repeat the process.  This wouldn't necessarily be the cleanest method but I am certain it would get about 90% of everything.
2: Someone writes a LWRP script to connect to the webserver, grab all the links by "subject" from the index listing (going all the back to May 2001) and then connects to every HTML page strip out the author, subject, date, etc and store it a DB....using some of the same principles and methods from above.
Personally I think #1 would be easier assuming that directory and file structure is static.  Let me know and I will try to cook up a quick perl script that does some of the basic stuff.  All you would need to do is create the tables and db structure based on the notes provided in the script.  I would need to see a directory structure listing and the format of the file each thread is stored in.

It's not that easy if you want a clean solution. Many mail clients break 
the threading by mangling subject lines, shortening subject lines, 
inserting quoted-printable encoding, or using custom "Re:"-prefixes (in 
Swedish it's "Sv:" in Microsoft's broken clients, for example). The 
cleanest would be to do three passes of the complete headers:
1) look for "in-reply-to"
2) look for "references"
3) sort by subject.

It can get ugly... :-)

Ah, I didn't see that. Yeah, they have the threading done too, you could 
parse the listing pages. The only drawback is that if you want "live" 
updates from a list you'll have to reparse all the time, but as a 
one-time operation, it's probably not a bad idea to parse the HTML 
pages... :-)

True.  The intent, I believe, is it to do a one time migration and then everthing would be in a true forum based format.  Then after that everyone just participates in the forum.  Either that a second script would need to be created that upon the receipt of every list email it would instantly be parsed and inserted into the DB.  But thats too much work I think.Russel P.

I'd suggest as a start that we port into a simple structured XML
format that can be reused by different people afterwards.  There
should be a tool that does this for pipermail archives... if it does
not exist, it would be a nice thing to make.

Then, secondly, there are different ways to use this.  Some people
have suggested a forum/email combination.  That would be lovely, it's
something I'm pushing for in Wikidot.  If we ever get it, we could
import the email data into that... but it's a future prospect.

So in the short term, importing the email data into a searchable
database seems doable, and definitely useful.

To be honest, I'm overloaded... and hoping the community can sort this
out.  I can certainly get you access to the archives.

I can help design an XML language, this is easy for me to do.

If you script-gurus can do that in 2 clicks, fine.

I suspect that future interest in the great Xitami will be too low to 
justify any real time/effort to organize the old emails.

 > I can certainly get you access to the archives.

There's about 13 Megs of text, but (as we see it) broken over 70+ files. 
13 megs is not small, but it is no longer a modem-choker like it was in 
1999. And it ought to compress very well, couple-Megs.

If you, Pieter, have internal access to dump the whole collection in one 
semi-ordered text file, just do it and post it somewhere. I started 
doing it by hand, and tried to 'cat' the pile in year/month order to a 
single file, but 700+ clicks wore me out.

(Also ".gz" is not something most Windows folks know what to do with. I 
do, but I turned to a unix box rather than try to teach Windows new 
tricks. Plain old ZIP may be more widely usable. I have not tried simply 
re-naming the .gz to .zip )

If someone really wants to, they can pull the 13 Megs into most modern 
text-editors and "Find.." their search-term, then use Find... again to 
follow interesting threads by Subject header. Few of our threads have 
been long or branchy.

You can send me the files and I will take a look at them. I am not going to discriminate articles, my goal will be to port the entire thing to a database or at least provide the script so that someone else can do it.  However, I will need the database format that you want to use and the table structure....I am assuming there is some kind of pre-existing forum structure this will all be imported into???  If not and you leave it up to me then i will create some custom tables and you will probably get first hand experience at how bad of a coder I am.  :-P
 
I will unzip all the files and see what I can do.
 
Anyone want to help or have input and/or suggestions on this?

Hey, this looks kick ass.  And it most importantly it requires no work. 
Because the Xitami mail list uses Mailman (I believe I read that earlier) 
all you have to do is point to the base URL of the archives...from there I 
think it will just import everything on its own.

Then Pieter can simply embed this form in the xitami.wikidot.com pages and 
members of the xitami list can search all previous content: 
http://www.mail-archive.com/faq.html#search

oh...and its free!

Subject: [Xitami] 301 error handling
Message-ID: <BAY105-DAV25F3D0907CC10D61A4351F8230@phx.gbl>

Hey all,

The "errors" section of the Xitami admin has predefined values for 400, 401, 404 errors etc, but nothing for 301 redirects.  I am in the process of renaming my static links from ID based links such as /postShow/3/26/0/383472 to name based links like /postShow/chat-groups/local-politics/page-0/id-383472 or something to that affect.

However, I don't want search engines such as google or yahoo that have already crawled and indexed all the ID based links to error out, or drop the indexed link, after I make the change - I have over 100,000 indexed pages.  This is more important for the search engines than it is for the users. If the search engine sees that the ID based links are gone without info one where they have gone to, they will drop all the indexed links and it could take weeks if not months for them to recrawl the new links.

Other webservers such as apache can use 301 redirects to basically tell the SE, the user or the browser, that although the old links have changed the content still exists - its just simply at a new location.  The SEs will simply change the index link versus dropping it completely.  Doing a simple "redirect=0" in the HEAD or using JS "location.href=..." isn't good enough because to a search engine the original page still exists but now its content is simply gone or empty.

Is it possible to define errors or anyone know of a way to code in 301 redirects at the server level?

Thanks.

What about the following idea - I don't know if it really works:

Make the 404 Error Handler be handled by PHP.
Write a PHP script that modifies the header to 301 instead 404. You will need a script anyway for assigning the correct new path according to the old path.

I remember there was the question how to use 404 with PHP here a few weeks ago.

  However, I don't want search engines such as google or yahoo that have already crawled and indexed all the ID based links to error out, or drop the indexed link, after I make the change - I have over 100,000 indexed pages.  This is more important for the search engines than it is for the users. If the search engine sees that the ID based links are gone without info one where they have gone to, they will drop all the indexed links and it could take weeks if not months for them to recrawl the new links.

  Other webservers such as apache can use 301 redirects to basically tell the SE, the user or the browser, that although the old links have changed the content still exists - its just simply at a new location.  The SEs will simply change the index link versus dropping it completely.  Doing a simple "redirect=0" in the HEAD or using JS "location.href=..." isn't good enough because to a search engine the original page still exists but now its content is simply gone or empty.

  Is it possible to define errors or anyone know of a way to code in 301 redirects at the server level?

  Thanks.

Subject: [Xitami] Additional error handling issue
Message-ID: <BAY105-DAV8B21FC1CB6FD0ADF2A722F8230@phx.gbl>

I wrote a perl header to handle 404 errors for pages that no longer exist.

use CGI qw/header/ ;

print header(-expires=>'now',
    -status=>'404 Not Found',
    -type=>'text/html'); 
print qq{ $rest_of_html } ;

Using a page like http://web-sniffer.net, the HTTP Response Header comes back as a valid 404 Not Found page, however my web log shows the GET as status code 200.

In access.log
76.173.7.200 - - [19/Feb/2008:23:03:09 -0800] "GET /pshow/lax/3/26/0/19307/ HTTP/1.1" 200 437 "" ""

FYI: /pshow is aliased to /cgi-bin/postShow.pl - which is a successful script call.

In errors.log : nothing listed.

The 200 at the end of that access.log line is the status code, the 437 is the file size of the returned HTML.  But why am I getting a 200 and no recording of a 404 when in fact other Header Response analysis sites do show the page returning a valid 404? 

Is it because the server is successfully calling the script so it logs a 200, but then the script fails the ID lookup, and returns a 404?  If this is the case, how do I get my access.log file or errors.log file to log the 404 error?

Any insight would greatly help.
Thanks

Well I have figured out how to do script error handling with Perl and PHP.  But the logs don't reflect what is going on because if the script exists, Xitami returns a '200 OK'.  Once the script is executed, the script determines if a 301 or 404 (or which ever code is needed) and returns that to the browser.  So the log says 200, but the HTML Response Headers show 404.  How can this be corrected?

In addition, everything is coming back as HTTP/1.0 - the documentation says Xitami Server supports 1.0, but then goes on to say Virtual Hosts support HTTP/1.1 - why would the main server support one thing versus the virtual servers supporting another?  http://legacy.imatix.com/html/xitami/

Thanks

  What about the following idea - I don't know if it really works:

  Make the 404 Error Handler be handled by PHP.
  Write a PHP script that modifies the header to 301 instead 404. You will need a script anyway for assigning the correct new path according to the old path.

  I remember there was the question how to use 404 with PHP here a few weeks ago.

You need HTTP/1.1 for virtual hosts, it's not available in the basic
protocol.
HTTP/1.1 also support the "keep-alive" directive (header).
That's basically the main difference between the two.

However, no system (client or server) cares for HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0, they
just look at the other headers.
