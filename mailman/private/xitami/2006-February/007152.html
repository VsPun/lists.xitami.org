<PRE>All you have written below is a little complicated to understand. I
don't write in VB for example, I write in Perl. 

And I haven't been able to understand why the NICs influence what
happens  and how the IP is a problem. Unless you have assigned
independent config files and disabled cgi in each and everyone of these
problem IPs you mention, the IP should not matter. A referrer is a
referrer, a simple url, no matter which IP or domain it is located on.

1) I have not been able to find a Std. windows error #13 Type error. The
ones I know have three digits. Eg: Error Code 121.
What does the #13 Type error say? 

3) If CGI is enabled on all of the 10 different domain configurations,
the http-referer and the remote-addr fields are on the environment hash
by default (environment=0). You do not have to set the environment to 1
in config to have them on the hash. 

4) The http-referer will exist in the environment hash, only if there
actually was a referrer (a mouse click on a link or a submit button on a
real page bringing the user to your url). If the url was typed into the
address bar of the browser, there will be no http-referer. Then your
program  can not read it then from the environment hash.

5) Did you print out the environment hash to yourself, under the
conditions that the error occurs in your browser? What do the fields
say? Which IP do you appear to have when the error occurs? What does the
http-referer say? What does your program do with this information? In
which line of your program does the problem happen? Is your test logic
entirely correct?

What I was looking more or less to do, is adding a way to monitor 
A) who the requesting IP is, and block them on the fly if they hit to
hard or to frequent 
B) to log the incoming IP to verify at the same time if the CGI referer
is local or from an
outside source, in which case I can refuse connections and send them to
the primary 
access page, routing all traffic from the own web site to access the
page in question.

The later I will likely have to do using a simple JavaScript testing the
referer vs. the document.domain property.

	I hope someone can remark on the real causes/solutions you are
looking

	Further, VERY odd behaviors are now noted in this execution.	
	I loaded the entire load of data for testing over to the server
machines	root directory.
	Now, it is loaded in to the default directory of Xitami,
bypassing any
	virtual host paths and so on.
	This in it self should not have any bearing on the serving of
pages, let
	alone the execution of the very same code.
	
	After all I can easily pull the same information in a JS page or
similar
	script without any issues.
	
	However, to further complicate the issue.
	
	The server box is running through dual NICs
	
	Assume for the sake of conversation that I have a 
	
	<A HREF="http://localhost">http://localhost</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</A>&gt;  &lt;<A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</A> &gt;
which is 127.0.0.1
	
	Then I have two (2) IP addresses which are public (Static) to
the
	internet 
	
	10.0.0.99 and 10.0.0.98
	
	(of course these are fictitious and should be (83.###.#.##) and
	something else but it's an example)
	
	When I execute the CGI on 127.0.0.1/MyPage.htm and send the call
by a
	simple GET to the CGI-BIN the code works perfectly!
	Not a single fault anywhere to be seen.
	
	When I execute the code on 10.0.0.99 it bumps me around saying,
I
	executed from a non permissable CGI_Referer
	HA... the code actually works.
	
	I wrote a thing that disallows cross linking from other domains
so you
	can't run the cgi embedded in an other web site and call my
pages from
	the other site.
	
	Then, thinking logically...
	
	If the 10.0.0.99 page is disallowed, the page will thereby
assume it
	self as running on 10.0.0.98 in this case, 
	so the thread in Xitami actually waking up to the call to the
page is
	located on the other IP.
	
	I opened a page in 10.0.0.98/MyPage.htm instead and executed the
click
	by doing a Get for the page
	
	myCGI.exe?Param1=0&amp;Param2=6574&amp;Param3=9&amp;ParamText=
	
	is now returning the same goofball errors as before.
	
	Previously noted above, everything picks up correctly, and is
collected
	as should be.
	In this case, when being on the correct IP and all, the cgi
doesn't even
	allow me to get CG_Referer as a string.
	Nor CG_RemoteAddr or any other data.
	
	So in conclusion.
	
	1) I have to remove my IP blocking system and open up for cross
linking
	or I have to find a way to allow two or more CGI_Referer values
to
	enable this security feature when running Xitami on dual NIC's

	        Std. windows error #13 Type error.
	        
	        I pass a internal call in the cgi called CGI_UserAgent
which
	supposedly returns the browser data.
	        
	        It works just fine on the workstation, AND on the server
in an
	other cgi I wrote using the same bas file.
	        
	        It does not in this but gives me this error.
	        
	        I rem the line, recompile and try again.
	        
	        Then I get a problem in the very next line, saying the
same
	thing for CGI_RemoteAddress
	        which is just getting the visitors IP address in a
string.
	        
	        This too, works in another cgi on both machines, but not
in this
	one on the server.
	        
	        For reference, the CGI's use standard I/O calls and work
just ok
	in all other cases.
