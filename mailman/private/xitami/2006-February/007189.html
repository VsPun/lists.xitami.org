<PRE>Oh by the way, the PDF will not open. Something about it not being supported
or corrupt.

OK. so I promised to release a little gadget that might help with the
problem of 
crashes being permanent and instead restore your Xitami process properly and
instantly, almost. This depends on the settings you chose in the
application.

It is called xitamiKeepAlive (xiKA for short) and I uploaded it to my web
site.

You can download it now and try it, but please know, I have only been able
to 
test it briefly on Windows XP since I have no 98, 95 or 200 machines here.
Also I don't use ME so I will not support that O/S

The zip file contains three files, xitamiKeepAlive.exe, xiKA.exe and the PDF

file with help and hints, FAQ and a lot more. Also a read-me file is
included 
pointing out the section H on page 9 in the PDF file as a vital read.

xitamiKeepAlive.exe is the GUI file to set it up and xiKA.exe is for the
hidden sleeper processing.

It uses approx. 3.2 Mb RAM and 0.0% CPU while waiting to act.

The application will also allow you to specify regular reboot periods 
for your server PC if you want to reset the machine completely.

If you guys want to send me feedback or test results, and perhaps let 
me know if it works on your machine, the instructions for this are 
included as well in the PDF file.

Please note! This application will only work on Windows and you must have
Visual Basic Runtime 6 SP 3 or higher installed.

And it is ONLY for Xitami 2.5c which has the xigui32.exe file.

My URL is HYPERLINK &quot;<A HREF="http://www.mrjdesign.net/&quot;http://www.mrjdesign.net/">http://www.mrjdesign.net/&quot;http://www.mrjdesign.net/</A> and
click the XITAMI link in the top menu.

If it doesn't work, it doesn't. But at least we will know, wont we :)
