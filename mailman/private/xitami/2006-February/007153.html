<PRE>

The Xitami server I am running, 2.5c2 seems to 
hold up very well as far as running html and some other simple CGI's on.
However I keep have a huge problem. Whenever I 
turn my back on the machine, it crashes.

I'm serious, not kidding, as long I am working on 
the machine or looking at the server, it seems ok and has no crashes at all.
As soon I leave it to itself for a day, I get a hung up on something.

I turned on the debug options and the debug 
option for CGI's as well and I cant even see any 
debug log files for the server in these 
instances, which leads me to believe everything 
is fine with the CGI's and the HTML.

I spent a day the other week cleaning up any 
missing linked background images and so on, and 
that doesn't seem to fix the problem either.

The logs are approx. as follows.

10 % goes to one virtual host which is serving 
practically one or two images to a forum, as an off site image linker only.

20% to another virtual host which has received 
about  19-20,000 pageviews in the past two weeks.
         Multiply this with about 12 for the 
actual number of logged hits to the server logs.

2% of the hits go to a base web site mentioned 
below. This is just a light weight survey CGI 
running up that right now and only some minute hits so far.

All the other hits go to a image archive web 
site, which logs app. 12-14 hits per pageview and 
so far I got 5000 pageviews in the past 5 days.

It's not that big at all when you consider the 
comparative number of hits I can see on Apache servers and IIS machines around.

What actually happens is, two out of three 
crashes state there is a C++ error in Xitami and 
it must be restarted and you are shown the option to restart .

1/3 of the crashes are critical and gives me a 
C++ error and the server simply shuts down. You 
are not show the option to restart in this case.

The really nasty thing is nothing works until you 
manually go in and restart the server in which 
time the sites all appear as off line and refuse connections.

Since I don't have the form titles I cant write a 
program to catch these events as they appear and 
do some automation task to make up for it.

Does anyone have any suggestions in how to resolve this?

Thanks in advance.
