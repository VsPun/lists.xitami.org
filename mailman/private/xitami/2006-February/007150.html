<PRE>I hope someone can remark on the real causes/solutions you are looking
for. 

You probably knnow these already, buf if all else fails some plain old
solutions: 

In order to restrict requests to the cgi-bin entirely, 
- you could password-protect the cgi-bin directory through a
&quot;mywebsite.aut&quot;.

To restrict access to this particular cgi program 
- you can put the program in an individual directory under cgi-bin and
password-protect that one
- you can use a cookies + login module 
- if all your internal IPs are known and permanent, you can use a module
to disallow all other IPs.

Subject: Re: [Xitami] CGI trouble - identical cfg - different execution

Further, VERY odd behaviors are now noted in this execution.

I loaded the entire load of data for testing over to the server machines
root directory.
Now, it is loaded in to the default directory of Xitami, bypassing any
virtual host paths and so on.
This in it self should not have any bearing on the serving of pages, let
alone the execution of the very same code.

After all I can easily pull the same information in a JS page or similar
script without any issues.

However, to further complicate the issue.

The server box is running through dual NICs

Assume for the sake of conversation that I have a 

<A HREF="http://localhost">http://localhost</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</A>&gt;  which is 127.0.0.1

Then I have two (2) IP addresses which are public (Static) to the
internet 

10.0.0.99 and 10.0.0.98

(of course these are fictitious and should be (83.###.#.##) and
something else but it's an example)

When I execute the CGI on 127.0.0.1/MyPage.htm and send the call by a
simple GET to the CGI-BIN the code works perfectly!
Not a single fault anywhere to be seen.

When I execute the code on 10.0.0.99 it bumps me around saying, I
executed from a non permissable CGI_Referer
HA... the code actually works.

I wrote a thing that disallows cross linking from other domains so you
can't run the cgi embedded in an other web site and call my pages from
the other site.

Then, thinking logically...

If the 10.0.0.99 page is disallowed, the page will thereby assume it
self as running on 10.0.0.98 in this case, 
so the thread in Xitami actually waking up to the call to the page is
located on the other IP.

I opened a page in 10.0.0.98/MyPage.htm instead and executed the click
by doing a Get for the page

myCGI.exe?Param1=0&amp;Param2=6574&amp;Param3=9&amp;ParamText=

is now returning the same goofball errors as before.

Previously noted above, everything picks up correctly, and is collected
as should be.
In this case, when being on the correct IP and all, the cgi doesn't even
allow me to get CG_Referer as a string.
Nor CG_RemoteAddr or any other data.

Talk about  a backwards acting resolution of the system


So in conclusion.


1) I have to remove my IP blocking system and open up for cross linking
or I have to find a way to allow two or more CGI_Referer values to
enable this security feature when running Xitami on dual NIC's

2) Has anyone else had any experience with trying to limit callers from
other domains to avoid getting connections from outside URL's and IP's,
and how did you solve this?

Thankful for any hints and pointers as usual.

	Now I have spent nearly a week working out some minor issues
with a CGI configuration in VB.
	
	It is not the VB part that is causing grievances, as that I have
down pat, however the problem is as follows.
	
	My test machine is...
	
	Win XP SP1 with Xitami 2.5 C2 running a single website in the
local NAT
	It has the default configuration files for the CGI environment
as left intact from setup.
	I have MDAC 2.8, MS Jet4.0 updates and all installed.
	
	My server, live machine
	
	has the indentical configuration as above, with two differences
	1) it has twice as much memory and drive space
	2) it also has a defaults.cfg file for defining some 10 virtual
domains, each with the std. setup for each.
	
	One further difference in this is
	
	the workstation works fine
	
	the server station does NOT.
	
	The errors I am getting are almost ridiculous.
	
	Std. windows error #13 Type error.
	
	I pass a internal call in the cgi called CGI_UserAgent which
supposedly returns the browser data.
	
	It works just fine on the workstation, AND on the server in an
other cgi I wrote using the same bas file.
	
	It does not in this but gives me this error.
	
	I rem the line, recompile and try again.
	
	Then I get a problem in the very next line, saying the same
thing for CGI_RemoteAddress
	which is just getting the visitors IP address in a string.
	
	This too, works in another cgi on both machines, but not in this
one on the server.
	
	For reference, the CGI's use standard I/O calls and work just ok
in all other cases.
	Only these bugs are about to drive me nuts.
	
	Does anyone have any idea as to why Xitami suddenly is so
unstable??
