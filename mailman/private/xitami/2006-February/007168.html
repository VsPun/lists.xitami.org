As far I can tell there are no plans on picking up a development on 
the Xitami server from Imatix again, which in it self is really sad.
What I have decided to do for now is wait but I have a friend 
studying in Denmark at the moment who should be coming over here 
shortly and he's a real guru with C and C++.
I will likely try to have my company spend some time and money on 
this guy for a uni project and have him revise Xitami by the open source.

If I can afford to sponsor this guy, I bet it could become a good 
project for developing a very stabile platform
server and also give something back to the Xitami community as a whole.

When the time is right and I start this up, I'll keep this forum 
posted on any such plans as well.
