<PRE>Now I have spent nearly a week working out some minor issues with a CGI 
configuration in VB.

It is not the VB part that is causing grievances, as that I have down pat, 
however the problem is as follows.

My test machine is...

Win XP SP1 with Xitami 2.5 C2 running a single website in the local NAT
It has the default configuration files for the CGI environment as left 
intact from setup.
I have MDAC 2.8, MS Jet4.0 updates and all installed.

My server, live machine

has the indentical configuration as above, with two differences
1) it has twice as much memory and drive space
2) it also has a defaults.cfg file for defining some 10 virtual domains, 
each with the std. setup for each.

One further difference in this is

the workstation works fine

the server station does NOT.

The errors I am getting are almost ridiculous.

Std. windows error #13 Type error.

I pass a internal call in the cgi called CGI_UserAgent which supposedly 
returns the browser data.

It works just fine on the workstation, AND on the server in an other cgi I 
wrote using the same bas file.

It does not in this but gives me this error.

I rem the line, recompile and try again.

Then I get a problem in the very next line, saying the same thing for 
CGI_RemoteAddress
which is just getting the visitors IP address in a string.

This too, works in another cgi on both machines, but not in this one on the 
server.

For reference, the CGI's use standard I/O calls and work just ok in all 
other cases.
Only these bugs are about to drive me nuts.

Does anyone have any idea as to why Xitami suddenly is so unstable??
