I know I'm grabbing at straws but...

All day yesterday, October 31, Halloween, from 1:11AM through 12:25AM this
morning, November 1, I was having issues with Xitami 2.4d6, a version that
has worked without a hitch for the past 9 years!  The server began
"bouncing", serving erratically.  Not a crash.  I would see a page, a
refresh 15 sec. later I'd maybe see the text but no images, then some
images, then it would show nothing, then it would work fine, this cycle for
23+ hours.  The it stopped.  I spent much of yesterday looking for a Denial
of Service attack.  There was none.   Bad network card or hardware, no.
Analyzed all traffic, nothing.

So my question is:  By chance, did anyone else experience any issues?

Thanks

Phil

R - Thanks for the reply.  I was on the phone to them 4 times yesterday.
They couldn't find anything in general or relating specifically to me.
Phil.

  I don't man....sounds spooky to me!  LOL  2.4d6 was the most stable
version of Xitami, I too still use it but my server has been down for the
last week for hardware maintenance so I wasn't able to observe any
spookiness.

  Maybe it was your service provider that was having issues causing and
creating delays for traffic to and from your server. Maybe check with them.
