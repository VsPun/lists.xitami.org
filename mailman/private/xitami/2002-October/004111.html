<PRE>[I'm still over a week behind in catching up on three mailing lists, so
forgive me if someone has already posted a correction: a cursory look
through the titles of unread mails didn't seem to show any such, however]

In message &lt;<A HREF="mailto:1912056257842.20021003144033@rci.rutgers.edu">1912056257842.20021003144033@rci.rutgers.edu</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt; a way to combine monthly access logs so that my log analyzer can

</I>&gt;<i> In DOS/Win:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> copy ac020201.log + ac020301.log + ac020301.log big.log
</I>
Yes.  [I'm not too sure that DOS permits spaces around the plus-signs,
however; I've certainly never used them.]

&gt;<i> or -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> echo ac02????.log &gt;&gt; big.log
</I>
Errm, the above will append the string of characters &quot;ac02????.log&quot; to
the file big.log (creating the latter if it doesn't already exist).

I suspect that you might have wanted to suggest
&gt;<i> type ac02????.log &gt;&gt; big.log
</I>which would output each log file to stdout, which is redirected to append
to big.log.

However, that is not possible: remember that DOS/Windoze does all file
globbing IN the applications, and that the TYPE command is not written to
perform wildcard expansion.

However, all is not lost: DOS possesses a FOR command, so the original
poster could try:
&gt;<i> for %f in (ac02????.log) do type %f &gt;&gt; big.log
</I>which will concatenate all the files into big.log.  However, there is no
guarantee that they will be in any particular order: DOS will get them in
whatever order they have been fitted into empty slots in the directory
structure.  So it might be necessary instead to write:
&gt;<i> for %f in (ac020101 ac020201 ac020301) do type %f.log &gt;&gt; big.log
</I>if the order is important to the analysis.

&gt;<i> In Unix, replace echo with cat?
</I>
Errm, yes.  The files will appear in the &quot;correct&quot; order.
