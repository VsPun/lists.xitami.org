<PRE>&gt;<i> Xitami FTP doesn't handle client NAT very well, but ISS FTP service does.
</I>
Don't use Xitami's FTP if it gives you any trouble. It's just a free
bonus in a free program. It's worth more than nothing, but is just
basic simple FTP. It hasn't been looked at since home-NAT became
common.

Don't use IIS _PERIOD_. Aside from being bug-bait, it likes to leave
bits of itself behind even when you think you've removed it. Maybe
it's what's blocking X's FTP.

There are a zillion cheap and free FTP servers. A dozen of them are
good. War FTP seems popular. Maybe someone will pop in with one they
like better.
