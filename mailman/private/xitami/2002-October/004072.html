This works fine and isn't slow.

&gt;<i> messed-up SHTML url: www.graysoftenterprises.com/default.shtml
</I>
This returns &quot;An internal Visual Basic error has occurred in
\default.shtml. File not found (error #53), GSECntr&quot;

So I would say VB is getting called, but isn't getting some slice of
information.

Visual Basic is _NOT_ a good language for CGI. Oh, I've done it and
got a paycheck. But I had to study the sample VB application that
came with Xitami to find out how to get the CGI arguments and STDIN.
MS BASIC and VB really don't like to do that.

Off the top of my head: what's wrong with the iFrame version? It
isn't slow. Your site is unlikely to draw so much traffic that the
server CPU will choke. Sure it won't work in NetScape4, and there
are security flaws in IE's iFrames, but everybody else does it.

I'd also (since you seem to study programming) look to porting to
Perl or PHP. Both of these love to read STDIN. The code I wrote in
VB in a month ported to Perl in a few days and to PHP in a couple
weeks part-time. VB is a valuable skill for client-side programming,
but Perl or PHP are very valuable server-side skills.

You could easily track calf records on the server with Perl or PHP.
Then the users could access their calfbook from the house, the
(PC-equiped) barn, or out at an auction site, even on a friend's or
stranger's PC, since the records are centralized and the PC just
needs a browser interface. You probably won't want to do that,
because keeping everybody's calfbooks safe is expensive and it is
hard to collect the bills.
