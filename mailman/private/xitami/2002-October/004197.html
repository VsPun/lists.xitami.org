<PRE>For the aliased sites in question, try renaming the index.php file and 
adding an index.html with some filler comment in it - I bet the alias will 
start working, and you'll get your filler html file.  If so, I think you're 
running into the same problem I did - I actually posted this to the list 
about a week ago, but nobody ever replied.

There appears to be a bug in Xitami that causes aliases and filters to 
conflict - I also use PHP and tried to set up some aliases, and found that 
when I accessed a php file via the normal document root it would work, and 
when I accessed an html file through an alias it would work, but when I 
tried to access a php file through an alias, it would return nothing.

I downloaded the source package but was unable to fully isolate the bug - 
all I know is that filters create temporary pipe????.flt files in your 
system temp folder which contain the parsed output to send to the client, 
and in the alias case, this file remains empty after the filter program was 
called.

Interestingly enough, there is actually a comment in the source code in the 
module that sets up filter-handling that says it doesn't take aliases into 
account - it would seem the designers already know this is a problem, and 
just haven't gotten around to fixing it.  So, my advice is to email Xitami's 
bug report address and ask them to.

Subject: [Xitami] Alias not working?

Hi folks,
I'm doing a lot of web development and would like to access any of my
sites
without having to change the default path setting everytime. I'm trying to
use the ALIAS  settings to allow me this feature.

Here is what I have in defaults.cfg:

[Alias]
    /gsinc/=C:\Websites\New GrainStoves
    /mxc/=C:\Websites\TransCan\local_website\www_mxc
[Filter]
    .php=C:\PHP\php.exe
[Security]
    Filename=defaults.aut
[Server]
    Debug=1
    Default1=index.php
    Default2=index.html
    Webpages=C:\Websites\

How come I can't access those two sites by: <A HREF="Http://127.0.0.1/gsinc">Http://127.0.0.1/gsinc</A> or
<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/mxc">http://127.0.0.1/mxc</A> ?

I'd appreiate any help,
Thanks,
James
