<PRE>Hello Vera,

VC&gt; Murali... I downloaded this file, bs3225b4.exe and installed it.
VC&gt; This seems to be version 2.5b4 for Windows NT, 95, 98, Linux, OS/2, and Unix.
VC&gt; (I'm using Win XP)

VC&gt; In the &quot;Computer Management&quot;, under Services, I now have
VC&gt; &quot;Xitami Web Server&quot;, and it says it's running.

OK, so permissions shouldn't be an issue.

VC&gt; errors.log:
VC&gt;     127.0.0.1 - vera [10/Feb/2004:18:55:12 -0600] &quot;GET
VC&gt; /cgi-bin/test.cgi HTTP/1.1&quot; 500 1065 &quot;&quot; &quot;Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;
VC&gt; MSIE

I'm assuming that '500' refers to HTTP error code 500, which means
Internal Server Error. I don't know much about Xitami config, so
hopefully one of the more experienced people here can think of
something that might be causing it?

Is the Perl script trying to talk to MySQL at all? A quick Google for
'http error messages 1065' came up with it as a MySQL error return,
associated with 'ER_EMPTY_QUERY'.

Sorry I couldn't be of any more help.

 &lt;Rebot&gt; 'muz': Deeply conservative student, both in politics and
 demeanour. Lives a life of luxurious decadance, getting rich off the
 backs of common working men, while those around him wallow in filth.
 The closest he came to student rebellion was when he wrote a harsh
 letter to the council, complaining that they wouldn't remove a barrel
 of caviar tins deposited at the edge of his vast estate. Git.
