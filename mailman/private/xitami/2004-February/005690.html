<PRE>Hello Vera,

VC&gt; I donno how to install anything as a &quot;system service&quot;... I'll hunt the help file
VC&gt; but if you got time I'd appreciate a dab of tutoring.

Right. So I'm assuming that you're manually running Xitami every time
you start your PC, or you've put it in your Startup folder?

A quick way to check what services you have installed is to open a
command prompt window and type 'net start'. This will give you a list
of all services currently running. 'Xitami Web Server' will be near
the bottom of the list, if it's there. If it's not, then...

Installing as a system service - off the top of my head:

1) Make sure you're logged in as administrator. (If you only have one
   user account, then you don't need to worry about this.)
2) Open a command prompt. (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; cmd.exe)
3) Navigate to your Xitami install (Usually C:\Xitami)
4) Type 'xiwinnt -i' (This installs Xitami as a service)
5) Type 'net start xitami' in the command prompt. (This starts the
   service - I can't remember if Xitami starts straight after install,
   but if it does, no problem. It'll just kick up an error saying &quot;The
   requested service has already been started.&quot;)

Try running your script now. If it doesn't work, you've wasted five
minutes, and you've eliminated one cause of the error. :)

If it does work, then you'll want to make sure that the Xitami service
starts up by default. To that end:

1) Right click 'My Computer' and click 'Manage' (The Computer
   Management window should appear.)
2) Under 'Services and Applications' in the folder tree on the right,
   select. 'Services'. (A fat list of services should appear in the
   main window.)
3) Scroll down the list until you see 'Xitami Web Server'. Scroll
   across and see what it's 'Startup type' field is set to. If it says
   'Automatic', then you're away. If not, right click -&gt; properties,
   and change it to 'Automatic'. Job done.

Hope this helps. Good luck. :)

 &lt;Muz&gt; &quot;...the complete decimation of the British Isles was caused by
 a number of factors, but the common consensus among historians is
 that it was brought about mainly by the inflammatory writings of a
 mysterious right-wing underground organisation known only as Teh
 Crosshatch.&quot;
