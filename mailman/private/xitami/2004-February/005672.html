<PRE>Now that I have my web server up and running, I'm focusing on making it as
error free as possible.  Since 6am today I've gotten 1078 hits and 95 http
errors.  I've used WebLog expert to analyze the access.log file, and it is
showing all of the errors to be 404 not found errors, but none of my links
are bad, so I don't understand what this could be caused by.  The only thing
I can track down is that the most commonly requested files are cmd.exe and
httpodbc.dll, and I don't know why these particular files are being
accessed.  I am wondering if Xitami is using these files for it's own use,
and that's why they're being requested, if some javascript I'm using needs
them, or if it's an issue of people actually trying to access them.  I can't
imagine the point of downloading that dll file or the command prompt, but
when I try to access those files with the paths listed in the WebLog report,
I get an error about the file not being found on the server.  Any ideas?
