  Subject: Re: [Xitami] xitami and domain name


  Hello Tom, :)

  Thanks for your time, help, and advise!!!!

  In your Reply for &quot;xitami and domain name&quot; you mentioned the =
following:

     &quot;Depending on your network topology, have you=20
      checked that Xitami is bound to all IP's?&quot;

  I have tried to find out how to &quot;BIND Xitami to all IPs&quot; using =
Searches on the Internet and the Xitami Document, but am not having any =
success.

You correctly set it in your previous message. I just used general =
terms.

  Could you please give an example or point me to a link/document that =
describes binding Xitami?


  FYI,,,,I am a novice user of Xitami. Just loaded it last week and all =
seems to be working as expected on a LAN using 8 PCs (W95 and W98SE). =
Xitami is on a W98SE and I am learning and testing using the HOSTS file =
at each PC to force Domain Names to the I
  P address of the PC where Xitami is installed.=20

  Hosts file example:


               xx.yy.zz.1  www.abc.com
               xx.yy.zz.1  www.def.com
                      etc.

  These are not registered Domain Names and are used for testing. =
However, when Xitami is configured to depend on registerd names via =
Virtual Hosting, I suspect that I will have the same problem as =
described by <A HREF="mailto:shing@walla.co.il.">shing@walla.co.il.</A>=20

  I thought that using a registered Domain Name should have worked =
within shing's LAN. If the Domain Name is not in the HOSTS file I =
thought it would be routed to the www database (HOSTS file) at the DNS =
Server which would then route it to shing's IP wher
  e Xitami is installed. That is what I thought(????). I have been away =
from the net a long time (circa 1975) and there is a lot I have to =
learn.
It should and does work as you described.=20

  BTW,,,,, all my PCs are behind a router with the NAT firewall, so I =
may also have to expose the Xitami PC to the Internet when Xitami is =
configured to start using registerd Domain Names(???).

  Thanks again for your time, help and advise!!!

  Jerry :)
You can have Xitami behind the firewall. You have to configure the =
router to pass all traffic for port 80 to the PC running Xitami.

Here's how the request process should work:
Someone far away requests www.yourdomain.com. The appropriate DNS =
servers hand back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1 (These addresses =
are made up for this discussion). A request to port 80 of 192.168.0.1 =
for www.yourdomain.com is made, and Xitami returns the webpage.
If you are running more than one domain name on Xitami, Xitami Virtual =
hosts will recognise which domain is being asked for, and supplies it.

So now let's say you want to access the website from inside your =
network. You type is www.yourdomain.com. an appropriate outside DNS =
server hands back www.yourdomain.com =3D 192.168.0.1. Your PC says &quot;Hey! =
That's only one PC away from me!&quot; And connect directly to it.

As you can see, it's exactly the same mechanism for being inside the =
network or outside the network.

So what we are dealing with here is some other problem. If all the above =
works from the outside, but not the inside, it is almost certainly a =
firewall problem.
If you are having problems with both the outside and the inside, it =
could be either DNS not configured properly, firewall not configured =
properly, or Xitami not configured properly.

Hope this helps,
Tom
