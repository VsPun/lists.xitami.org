Okay, here we go:

1) Load the file in question into your favourite text editor (e.g. Notepad,=
=20
Textpad, vi, MS Word, ...)

2) locate the occurences of relative URIs in header(&quot;Location:=20
blablablah.xyz&quot;) where blahblahblah.xyz _IS_ the relative URI

3) find out the the name of your webserver and the path to your script=20
(blahblahblah.xyz) relative to the document root of your webserver (you=20
probably have some knowledge of the hostname where you want to deploy your=
=20
application to, if not, ask someone next to you; when you try to deploy=20
your app, you probably already found out where your webserver's document=20
root is - otherwise you couldn't deploy it all)

3 a) (altenative to 3) ) learn some php, it provides you with variables &amp;=20
functions, finding out your hostname and the path to your script, in case=20
3) didn't give you the desired results or in case you think of a more=20
generic approach to our task in question

4) from step 3 or 3a we get something like=20
<A HREF="http://www.myhost.org/nested/path/to/my/script/called/blahblahblahblah.xyz=">http://www.myhost.org/nested/path/to/my/script/called/blahblahblahblah.xyz=</A>
=20
. In your editor move the cursor in front of blahblahblah.xyz and type=20
<A HREF="http://www.myhost.org/nested/path/to/my/script/called/">http://www.myhost.org/nested/path/to/my/script/called/</A> .

5) Save your file in question.

6) Reload it in the browser.

7) Voil=E1

Actually, it is less difficult than it looks at first sight. Give it a try=
=20
and'you're on your way to a cool IT expert.

Regards,
tony
