<PRE>Yesterday I deleted an .AUT file, thinking it wasn't in use by any of the
virtual hosts. Then a while later, I found Xitami (running as an NT service)
dead. I tried restarting it, it would start, and then die right away. I had also
edited the configuration files prior to this so I thought I did something wrong
in the configuration files, and it caused some sort of crash. Well, it turnes
out the .AUT file I deleted *was* needed by a virtual host, and since Xitami
couldn't find it, it quit after initializing.

The &quot;xiwinnt.exe -d&quot; command (runs Xitami as a console app as opposed to a
service) saved my day. =) I'm posting this because it took me some time to find
out what was wrong. I'm hoping if it happens to somebody else, this post might
be
useful.

Also, if Xitami wrote an error event to the Event Log about errors like this
one,
life would be much easier, methinks.
