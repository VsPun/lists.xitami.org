<PRE>I'm using Xitami Pro and will probably NEVER use Apache for anything. But that's not the point of
this post. I use PHP 4.3.1 (current) with Xitami flawlessly. I have register globals=off.

For weeks I've been trying to find a webmail script that will work with that configuration and my
mailserver of Mercury. I had previously found Squirrelmail and it wouldn't work, or so I thought.
After exhausting other efforts, I returned to it and started examining the source scripts. Lo and
behold, I found that the header(&quot;Locations ... function they had in the files was a relative URI.
HTTP/1.1 spec requires a full URI.

I have no problem using the 1.0 spec, but I don't know how! So, I changed all the header commands to
a full URL.

Does anyone have any idea where and if I can change to the HTTP/1.0. specification? Also, since I
use SSL on one subdomain, doesn't SSL require the 1.1 specification?

Thanks in advance!
