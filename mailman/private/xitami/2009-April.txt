Have just downloaded xitami and installed.
I am using a book (which is fairly old) on Perl.  I have tested xitami (as per my book) which seems to be working.
The Perl book tells me that Perl scripts (.pl) should be loaded into a dir, cgi-bin, which I had to create under the xitami directory.
The book gives a perl file to test and gives the location of  the web browser to be http://localhost/virtual_scripts_directory/perltest.pl
This does not work, error "The resource you asked for does not exist on this website".

Where should .pl files be put?
Is the location correct?

Welcome to Xitami...didn't know new users were still joining.  Though the 
version of Xitami you installed is probably quite old as iMatix stopped 
development on it many years ago.  But, there is hope because the developers 
have recently picked it up again and have released Xitami 5.  I don't quite 
know the state of it yet but its still early stage.  It is probably best you 
use the older version, as it is stable, until you become more familiar with 
it and its features.

To your questions.

1.  The cgi-bin should already be a part of the install thus there would be 
no need to create a second cgi-bin directory.
2.  In the Xitami administration pages, go to the main section and make 
certain your 'cgi-bin' path options are set correctly.  That the main CGI 
directory is "cgi-bin" and either at the beginning of the path (ie: 
/cgi-bin/myscripts/go/here.pl) or just in the path itself (ie: 
/myScripts/cgi-bin/go/here.pl).  And then verify your script is in that 
directory.
3. Go to the CGI section of the admin pages and verify CGI is enabled, and 
there is a dash "-" in the working directory which implies to use the 
default program directory
4.  Verify that your windows/unix (don't know which you are using) system 
variables have associated ".pl" files to the Perl interpreter.  You can also 
map Xitami to execute .pl scripts by hard setting the defaults.cfg file 
under the Filter section:
[Filter]
    .php=c:\php\php.exe
    .pl=c:\perl\bin\perl.exe

The easiest way to test is to simply put your script into the default 
directory: /xitami/cgi-bin - and then execute 
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/perltest.pl - also, verify your script works from a 
command prompt first so you know the script is working correctly and that 
the script itself is not the source of the problem.

Good luck.  And welcome to the world of Xitami.
