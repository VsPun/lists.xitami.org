<PRE>I have been using XITAMI for a couple of years now, and have not had any
problems until I added PHP to run PHPbb.

The PHPbb application works with a couple major problems.

After trying to get help from both the PHP and the PHPBB folks with no
success, I decided to try exchanging XITAMI with the Apache server, and the
problems vanished.  It should be noted that no other change at all has been
made on the system, I can select either XITAMI or APACHE as my web server,
and I do not have to make any changes to the other software to see these
problems.

Here is the post where I describe the two problems.  I am at a loss on how
to change the XITAMI configuration to resolve these problems.  The only
thing I can think of to do is to uninstall XITAMI release 2.5b5 and give
2.4d9 a try.  Before I do that, I wanted to ask here on this list if anyone
has any ideas on what is causing these two problems.

I am having two problems with phpbb since I installed it.

I have not been able to figure out if they are related, or how to solve
either of them.

The first is fairly unimportant I think, but it may be the cause of my
second problem.

On some functions, like after I enter my login information, I get the
following message:

If your browser does not support meta redirection please click HERE to be
redirected

If I do nothing, I am taking to the forum. This same message shows up when
doing some of the administrative functions as well.

The other problem I am having is much more serious. For some reason once a
page is displayed, I can never refresh it unless I clear the cache in my
browser. For instance, If i make a mistake in a post, and do an edit, after
I complete the edit, it takes me back to the original page with the error on
it. If I click &quot;refresh&quot; I still get the same OLD page. If I clear the cache
in my browser, I then will get the corrected page.

Here is a copy of a previous post I made which has not received any
responses. It has the version details of the setup I am running.

--------------------------------- 

I am having the following problem, and have searched for an answer in three
different software groups and have not discovered a solution yet.

When I access a page in phpbb it displays fine, but it does not update
unless I clear the cache in my browser. (IE ver 6)

My configuration is:

WIN98
XITAMI v2.5b5
PHP 4.3.3
PHPBB 2.0.6
MYSQL 4.0.14

I have discovered that in XITAMI there is a parameter called &quot;cache
Defaults&quot; and if I turn this off, the codes on the requested pages change
from &quot;304&quot; to &quot;200&quot;, but the actual text on the displayed page does not
change. The simplest way to observe this is to do a refresh and note that
the time never changes. However all of the icons are reloaded, you can see
them blink as they are refreshed.

I have studied the PHP.INI file, but it does not give me any positive
indicators of what may not be configured correctly. I have tried changing a
few of the parameters, all with no effect at all.

My php.ini file has only one modification, and that is the
cgi.force_redirect=0 needed to have XITAMI display any .php pages at all.

Here is the log of sending the page after clearing the cache:
192.168.100.1 - - [03/Sep/2003:03:45:41 -0500] &quot;GET /forum/index.php
HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 27125

Here it is after a &quot;refresh&quot; and the time displayed on the page never
changes: (not the time in the log trace)
192.168.100.1 - - [03/Sep/2003:03:48:32 -0500] &quot;GET /forum/index.php
HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 25432

In the above trace example, the time on the screen was 03:45 and two minutes
later when I did the refresh, all the icons were replaced, but the actual
page stayed the same with the 03:45 time remaining. By clearing the cache in
the browser, a new page was retrieved, and the time was then 03:49

It looks like some cache on the server is failing to send the new page to
the browser for some reason, and the only way I can get it to work is to
clear the cache. I do not have this problem going to any other forum, and I
have accessed my server using several different computers, and all have this
identical problem with any page once it has been received by the remote
computer.
