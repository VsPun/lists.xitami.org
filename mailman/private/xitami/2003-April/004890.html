</I>&gt;<i>problems.
</I>&gt;<i>I am running a sever-only machine with Win2k and all the latest patches,
</I>&gt;<i>behind a ZoneAlarm Pro firewall with WWW, FTP and DNS ports open.
</I>&gt;<i>Xitami runs for anywhere between 2 hours, and 4 days before crashing. I have
</I>&gt;<i>not been able to find anything consistent in debug logs.
</I>&gt;<i>It simply dies, while leaving the tray icon, which of course disappears as
</I>&gt;<i>soon as you move your mouse over it.
</I>&gt;<i>Lately, it has been crashing with a C++ runtime error message window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So should I fall back to 2.4d5 and forgo the DOS patch? Is it actually that
</I>&gt;<i>2.4d9 is unstable? Or did the Beta install leave behind something?

</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for any insights you can give to this costly problem.

Costly?  What exactly are you doing that makes Xitami crashes costly?

I run Xitami v2.4d9 NT Service on WinXP and have no problems.  Shutting
down the server and restarting is a pain.  If you want a Xitami NT Service
monitor (something similar to ProtoNova v1.31's NT Service Monitor
program), I can whip up a quickie program for everyone to use.  I also run
ProtoNova on port 82 as an NT Service.  In my experience, most stuff is
more stable when implemented as an NT service for some reason or other
(perhaps the developers are more cautious about coding since NT services
can be a pain to debug).

Also, I notice you have an FTP server.  It is a well-known fact that
Xitami's FTP server is really buggy.  When I had the Xitami FTP server
enabled, the server crashed even as a NT service on a weekly basis.  Most
people here will tell you that you are better off with a real FTP server
unless you have a really low-load Xitami server (particularly in the FTP
arena).  Since I turned it off, I haven't had any problems.

Hope this helps!
