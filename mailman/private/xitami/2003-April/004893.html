&gt;<i> &gt; I am running the latest version of Xitami, but it keeps on crashing with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; illegal exception errors, what am I doing wrong ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TIA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Iain
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also having this problem!! Xitami used to be as stable as a rock. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe I used to run 2.4d5. I upgraded to the newest beta, had crashing
</I>&gt;<i> problems. Un-installed that, and installed 2.4d9, and still have crashing
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;<i> I am running a sever-only machine with Win2k and all the latest patches,
</I>&gt;<i> behind a ZoneAlarm Pro firewall with WWW, FTP and DNS ports open.
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami runs for anywhere between 2 hours, and 4 days before crashing. I
</I>have
&gt;<i> not been able to find anything consistent in debug logs.
</I>&gt;<i> It simply dies, while leaving the tray icon, which of course disappears as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as you move your mouse over it.
</I>&gt;<i> Lately, it has been crashing with a C++ runtime error message window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So should I fall back to 2.4d5 and forgo the DOS patch? Is it actually
</I>that
&gt;<i> 2.4d9 is unstable? Or did the Beta install leave behind something?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any insights you can give to this costly problem.
</I>&gt;<i>

My personal experience:

I am running Xitami v2.5b4 (Win32) on a dedicated hand-me-down P166 running
Win98SE (fully patched) in 80mb.  Zone Alarm (free version) assists.  FTP
and HTTP services enabled on a non-standard port-base.  The LWRP services
also runs.  I haven't quite got the virtual domain thing going yet, but
fooling around got me a basehost.cfg file.

In this configuration, the computer has been up for 15 straight days and
Xitami has been running for 12 days.  Except for an occassional browser
check of a ZA alert, the machine sits in the corner and is accessed from
other computers on the internal network (in NetBEUI and TCP/IP).

Admittedly, this is a low use private server accessed by invitation only.  I
receive anywhere from 0 to 6 individual hits per day (although AOL IPs can
be confusing).  Most of the rest of the hits are my internal web page tests.

I don't run the DOS console because it leaves a DOS box up and the Win32
version hasn't been a real problem.  The only freeze-up was 3 weeks ago when
I was getting probed in port 80.  The log showed a huge request string just
before things went dark.  Moving the base-port seems to have solved
everything.  However, not running on port 80 creates an interesting set of
problems.

&gt;<i>From an outside view point, it looks like a Windows support file may have
</I>gotten corrupted and the problem may not be in Xitami directly.  And lets
not forget a good cleaning of the box.  I had one motherboard that if I
didn't keep the processor heatsink fins and fan cleaned out, would overheat
and start generating exception errors (usually around 58-60 degrees (C)).
That was different.

Much luck,
Charles
