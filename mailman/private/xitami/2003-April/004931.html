Errm, it's a stupid question but, are you on an ADSL connection?  If so,
then it's likely that its assymetry is such that traffic TO your machine
(which in other circumstances would be you downloading from the rest of
the Internet, but in this instance is data being uploaded to your server)
will have twice the bandwidth of your uplink (which is this instance will
be carrying the traffic downloaded from your FTP server).

You could talk to your ISP; AIUI, it's possible to have an ADSL line's
assymetry reconfigured &quot;the other way round&quot;.

    &quot;We can no longer stand apart from Europe if we would.  Yet we are
    untrained to mix with our neighbours, or even talk to them&quot;.
