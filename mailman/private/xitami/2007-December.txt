Subject: [Xitami] Xitami/Vista/PHP combination
Message-ID: <609LLcRuE4930S07.1196702490@cmsweb07.cms.usa.net>

Hello,

I'm running Vista Home edition and Xitami v2.5b6. I'm trying to run PHP
5.2.5in combination with this. I've made the following alterations to
xitami.cfg:

[Filter]
.php=c:\php\php-cgi.exe 
[Mime]
php=application/x-httpd-php 

I've also changed php.ini:

cgi.force_redirect = 0

When I try running any .php-script, however, all I get is a Windows pop-up
message appears saying "CGI/FastCGI has stopped working: A problem caused the
program to stop working completely. Windows will close the program and notify
you if a solution is available". Oh...kay...

I don't think there's anything wrong with my configuration settings as such:
the interpreter obviously is found and the mime-types are configured
correctly, otherwise I wouldn't get this far. What happens is that the
interpreter (I've tried php.exe as well; same result) is started and then
crashes. I'm assuming this is a Vista-specific security issue, but I don't
know how to solve it?

Can anybody help me? Has anybody had similar experiences and found a fix?

Much obliged,

Yves Sucaet

 Hey all. I am having a problem getting CGI environment variables to appear in my scripts.  Is Xitami somehow stripping the referer query from the httpReferer environment variable?  My Xitami Server is config'd as follows: Full Envionment = yesPass HTTP fields = yesPass form fields = yes Pass Query_String = yesMy weblogs show the full referer information:     ie: http://www.google.com/search?ln=en&q=2002+honda+civic However, my perl cgi-bin scripts are only able to retrieve: http://www.google.com/search The cgi perl scripts, using two different methods: $httpReferer = $ENV{HTTP_REFERER} ;and$httpReferer = $query->referer() ; Return the same info: http://www.google.com/searchIn both cases, retrieving the Query_String (ie $ENV{QUERY_STRING} and $query->query_string() ), simply returns the string from my URL, not the referring URL. For whatever reason, I am not able to retrieve the full referring URL....only the partial...has anyone else seen this or know a work around?

Nope.
 
If I go to google and search for (2001 + honda + adcrow) info on my site I get bunch of results, one of which is: 
Ex: http://www.adcrow.com/cgi-bin/postList.pl?cityCode=san&cid=3&fid=26&sid=0 
 
The referring page would be: 
Ex: http://www.google.com/search?ln=en&q=honda+2001+adcrow
 
 
When I click that link, I am trapping the incoming HTTP info, using perls native $ENV{HTTP_REFERER} or perl's CGI $query->referer(), and I get the same result of : 
Ex: http://www.google.com/search
 
When I grab Query_String (from either method) I get the following:
Ex: cityCode=san&cid=3&fid=26&sid=0  - which is the query string FOR my URL, not the referring URL.
 
When I do print out the full environment variables, $ENV, no where in the returned HTTP enviornment value is the entire referer URL, just the partial pre query_string URL.
 
However, the full referer URL, including referer query_string, is showing up in Xitami's web logs.

This seems to be a Xitami feature (or bug). As I'm now moving stuff to
Linux I'm also investigating lighttpd which seems to be not disimilar
in philosphy to Xitami. I checked. Lighttpd displays the query in the
referer environment variable as you would hope.

Ubuntu server plus lighttpd (plus perl & php) seems to be a very
stable platform and it hasn't been that hard for me to migrate a test
Xitami server to Lighttpd. If you need this info then that looks like
the best way to go.

Interestingly the user's browser will have the correct
document.referer including the query string. You could possibly set a
cookie and reload if the cookie wasn't present to transfer the info to
the server?

You have something else running on port80, which means another web 
server -- most likely Microsoft Personal Web Server. Uninstall it or 
deactivate it (in Services, I think the service for PWS is called "IIS / 
internet information server onethingortheother" or "World Wide Web 
Publishing Service" just as the "full" IIS.

Try port 8080 it should not make much difference, and should be av ailble.

Console Box = Command Prompt. On Windows XP, Click Start, point at All
Programs, point at Accessories and then click Command Prompt.

For help on the commands that you can use in the command prompt window
type help at the command prompt which usually looks something like:
C:\Documents and Settings\<your user name>\:

If you want help on a specific command such as cd then type help cd at
the command prompt.

Not to worry about being new to this, I've 40+ years experience with
computers and I can still remember how confused I was when I first started.

Please forgive my oversimplification, but with the command prompt you
are dealing with something called DOS or Disk Operating System commands.
To understand this area of computing you might be best to get a book
from your library on DOS. It should have explanations for the various
commands in it. DOS is a very powerful but also primitive method of
interacting with your computer and it is well worth learning as you can
do things with it that you can't easily otherwise do.

Xitami is a web server, not an operating system, and offers no dial-in 
services. You should ask in a group related to the operating system you 
run on the server (Windows, Linux, etc).

Subject: [Xitami] Server connections
Message-ID: <BAY105-W19572EDD09555F2F05E4BBF85D0@phx.gbl>


 
Anyone know what the max tcp connections Xitami can handle is?  Certain physical servers can handle well over 10,000 tcp sessions at once, but what can the application of Xitami handle before it starts to choke up?  I presume this number is going to be significantly lower than what the physical server can handle.

In Xitami.cnf set "limit" to "0" (zero) which is the default anyway,
and you have no limit to the  number of connections.

But the real effective limit is your upload bandwidth

Just observe your system and see when it starts to slow significantly
