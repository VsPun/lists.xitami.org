<PRE>I don't know a solution but I can verify that this happened to me as
well when I upgraded to the newest version about a month ago ... I too
had to roll back to 2.4d10 ...

Also noticed that it wasn't reading the configuration file properly
either as it won't disable lrwp on port 81.

hi,

I'm a Xitami user, posted this problem before, large file on slow
connection doesn't work on
new Xitami, I had to switch back to old version 2.4d9, nobody could tell
me how to fix it until
now, good job!=20
hopefully Imatix will use this fix in new version.

KShaw
