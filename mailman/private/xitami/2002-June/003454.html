&gt;<i>Ok, folks need some serious help here, i don't have a lot of time to do
</I>research on this - so I need the crash course.
&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>I am running the normal Xitami and am upgrading to Xitami Pro.  As usual,
</I>there is hardly ANY documentation on how to do this step by step.  Do I
install to same directory OR do I install to a new directory and copy my
previous configs/directory structure over?  Because it is the Pro version
does that mean EVERY site is going to be a secure site - or can I only turn
the secure feature on for specific pages or links within each site?  Are
there tricky configurations I need to be aware of.  I do know I am supposed
to get a KEY from somewhere, but again, I don't understand this process.  I
don't want to disrupt my current installation.

To really understand SSL, you really should read the HTTPS RFC.  However,
since you are in a time crunch, let me take you quickly through what is
involved.

First off, your entire site can be run under SSL/TLS (if you want).  The
tricky part is to remember that the SSL/TLS protocol provides no means for
VHosting except by IP address under Xitami Pro.  This is due to the nature
of the SSL/TLS protocols and not Xitami.  The problem is that when an
SSL-capable client connects, the SSL server certificate that gets sent is
the one tied to the IP address and there is no way to determine what VHost
the client wants until after authentication.  This is, IMO, the biggest
blunder the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) ever made.

Second, all of your current configuration files can be the same as for
Xitami.  The SSL config is located in HTTPSSL.CFS (or something like that).
 Just edit the SSL config to point at the proper certificates needed for
the server.

Finally, you need a certificate chain.  This will consist of a root
certificate authority encrypted private key (e.g. Verisign) and your own
certificate that is signed by the owner of the private key of the root
cert.  You need both the encrypted server private key and unencrypted
server private key in order to get Xitami Pro to work.  Let me warn you
that Verisign signed certs. are *EXTREMELY* expensive and there are cheaper
alternatives to using their certs.

&gt;<i>I am in a bind and need to upgrade fast b/c one of my sites needs to do
</I>Credit Card transactions.  So any and all help is very appreciated.  I have
never worked with SSL and I am worried about the time involved to get this
all working.

Make sure that your user has a merchant account before going to the trouble
of setting up SSL so quickly.  If they don't have a merchant account, it
will take them about 2-3 weeks (minimum) to get one.

Hope this helps!
