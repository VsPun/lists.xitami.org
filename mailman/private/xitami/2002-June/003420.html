<PRE>I've tried asking this question on the PHP lists, but all I've gotten for 
answers is &quot;fix the CGI&quot; (it's been working fine as far as I can tell) and 
&quot;Use something other than Xitami&quot; (duh - if I wanted to use something else, 
I would)

I'm running a fairly customized Win98 machine.  There is plenty of 
memory, plenty of hard drive.  It's my workstation, so it's sharing a bunch 
of apps with the system, but Xitami seems to run fine.  I've got CGI 
working and the one script I run (a very simple mail client called 
ThinMailer) is working fine except for the fact that my inbox often has 300 
messages or so - it times out on that one.  So, I've downloaded 
Squirrelmail and PHP and have attempted to make them work.  No good.  
Currently, the &quot;test&quot; page grinds and grinds forever, and the status line says, 
&quot;Web site found, waiting for reply&quot; (how long does it take to connect to 
&quot;localhost&quot;?) Then  I get, &quot;This server is currently overloaded - please try 
again later &quot; - what overload? theres's only one program running on the 
server.

Anyway, any hints?
