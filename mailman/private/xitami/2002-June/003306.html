<PRE>Well 'many' here _my_ answers to your questions:

Q1) Any free e-mail servers? Any with web based admin?
A1) Any mail server will work as long they don't try to use the same ports as your webserver.  Rarely is that issue.  If your talking about mail server having a web interface then either interface has to work on another port of have a standard CGI that the webserver can use.
N1) If you want check out the main server at PMAIL.com.  Freeware and solid.

Q2) How well does the cold fusion express work from shining light prod? I am on a cold fusion enterprise server now.  What should I expect to lose if I transfer?
A2) Cold Fushion does not directly work with Xitami.  However there is freeware program called XiFushion that is extremely easy to install and will work with any Win32 version of Cold Fushion (Express thru Enterprise).  
If you use Enterprise with xitami the you shouldn't loose anything.  If your switching Express you loose the following: Speed(MacroMedia purposely slows down Express), compatability(some functions are disabled), plug-ins/external binaries(again disabled to get you to buy the full version)

Q3) I imagine that if I just download MySql and PHP that I can install it right and expect it to run on Xitami?
A3) You just download and install MySQl and your set.  No webserver directly integrates to MySQL.  If you download PHP with the installer you will have the option to install PHP into Xitami.
N3) Note: You can use XiFushion with PHP and get slightly better performance.

Q4) What is Python anyway?  They also make a Free Windows port.  <A HREF="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/">http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/</A>
A4) It another scripting language like PHP, Cold Fushion, ASP, and Miva.  
N4) Personally it's not my fav but again thats personal programming preference.

Q5) How does Sun Chili!Soft ASP compare against INstantASP Xitami?  MSRP is $495 <A HREF="http://www.chiliasp.com/chiliasp/default.asp?target=windows">http://www.chiliasp.com/chiliasp/default.asp?target=windows</A>
A5) Chilli Soft's ASP is a solid product.  It does work on PC's with Xitami but you need to have a Java Servlet engine running on your system.  Setup is nowhere near as user friendly as any of the other languages mentioned.  Plus you can't use ActivX DLL's or OCX's on a *nix system without WINE, and even that is buggy.  If your married to ASP then your stuck with IIS.
