&gt;<i> Am I hearing you guys say that the client FTP can dictate the ports

</I>
To some extent, yes.  Servers always listen for incoming connection
requests on the well-known port 21.  Servers will also accept incoming
data channel connections on well-known port 20.  However, FTP servers
[normally] *send* data out from some arbitrary port (as determined by the
next available socket for the create_socket primitive) to a specific data
port on the client.

Chris Olsen had already written earlier in the thread as follows:

 As always, for any server administrator, whether you run a single &quot;hobby&quot;
 server on your cable modem, or manage a WAN, a review of the appropriate
 RFC's would be in order to make sure that you understand what you are doing,
 and are doing it properly.  In this case, you would want to refer to RFC1579
 and RFC959.

It's advice that you, and anyone else concerned about &quot;how FTP works&quot;
would do well to heed.  I know that some RFCs can be particularly
difficult for the novice to understand (e.g. the one on Van Jacobson
header compression, or that on STAC data compression), but the &quot;basic&quot;
RFCs on &quot;basic&quot; protocols (such as SMTP, FTP, etc) are really not too
difficult at all.  Please DO go and read those RFCs; after all, these are
the standards that make the whole of the Internet work (despite the
attempts of Microsoft to undermine them by adding non-compliant
extensions to all and sundry).

Anyway, the fundamental position with &quot;traditional&quot; FTP is that the
client, upon the user asking to &quot;PUT &lt;somefile&gt;&quot; will issue the command
&quot;STOR &lt;filename&gt;&quot; to the server over the command channel (which goes from
some arbitrary port number on the client to port 21 on the server).
Assuming that the server is happy with this (the client, as
authenticated, is permitted to write into the current directory, etc),
the server will then listen on its default data connection port (20) for
the content of the file, which it will store away.  The essence of the
connection is that the client pushes the file to the server.

For transactions taking place in the opposite direction, Jon Postel and
the rest elected to follow the same model: the end with the file pushes
it to the end that's getting it.  To do this, the server needs to push
the file to the client.  Since client systems don't usually listen for
connections (unlike servers), the server needs to know to which port to
send the file (remember that for many client systems with multiple users
the &quot;ordinary&quot; unprivileged user may not create privileged ports, which
usually means those below 1024).  The client program is expected to
create a port on which to receive the data connection, and this will
usually be arbitrary at the whim of the client's operating system.
Therefore the PORT command is used to tell the server the correct port to
which to send the file: it specifies the 32-bit IP address and the 16-bit
port number, and the server then creates a socket connecting to that port
to send the file.

Now this works perfectly whilst the client and server are directly
connected; however, if there's an intervening firewall, or perhaps a
router that performs NAT (Network Address Translation), then the
protocols break down.  The NAT process, for instance, will not be capable
of changing the content of the PORT command to reflect the port number on
the firewall to which the server should send traffic nor even the IP
address of that machine; neither will it be able to forward that traffic
to the port number on the client computer originally specified in the
command (except with a proper ftp-proxy process running on the firewall).

Therefore the PASV command is available, which is sent to the server, and
causes it to listen for the client to initiate a data connection to a
port on the server.  The port to be used appears in the server's response
to the PASV command.  The process at the client end for storing the
retrieved file away then takes data from a socket which has *initiated*
the connection, and therefore there will be no problems with NAT or
firewalls.

One caveat: it might prove impossible to establish a data channel
connection when both client and server are behind non-proxying firewalls.

YMMV.
