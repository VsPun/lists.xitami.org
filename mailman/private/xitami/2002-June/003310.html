<PRE>You might want to go to <A HREF="http://download.cnet.com">http://download.cnet.com</A> and search for
&quot;ramdisk&quot;.
I used to use a commercial Ramdisk-software on a NT-Workstation called
&quot;Superdisk&quot;
(now SuperSpeed), see <A HREF="http://www.eecsys.com.">http://www.eecsys.com.</A> The price depends on size
of
memory and processortype (it was about $180 for a PII-450 with 512 MB).
You can
define a whole partition (say half as big as your physical memory) 
as a ramdisk, which will be loaded into RAM a boottime.
A lazy write-through mechanism reflects all filechanges to the
harddrive.
I put the whole website onto this partition, including the Perl and
REXX-Interpreter.

But you should bare in mind, that often used files will be held in the 
system-filecache by Windows itself, so you probably won't need a ramdisk
at all

Greetings
Axel

Win95 and 98 allow some sort of ramdrive through config.sys.  There is a
way to get WinMe to do it as well (force it to load config.sys on boot).
There is a program called RamDiskNT by a company called Cenatek out
there
that will do the trick for NT/2000 (don't know about XP), but it costs
money.  So, those are probably your options unless you want to play with
device drivers...

Win95/98/Me - search Google.com
WinNT/2000 - pay money (I think the most expensive I've seen is $4,000+
for
ram drive software...that's rediculous).

Hope this helps!
