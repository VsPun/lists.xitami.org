Indeed, useful comments, thanks.  We plan to rewrite the web-based 
configuration tool, using a more general approach based on XML 
configuration files.  We are starting to use this approach in our 
internal products.

It looks like we have solved one of the big problems with log 
cycling, namely that it occasionally fails, and we will put this fix 
into the 2.5 release as soon as we can.

We have spent some time rewriting the core and improving other parts 
of the SMT kernel on which Xitami is based.  This should make it more 
stable.  We are also increasing the use of GSL as a scripting 
language inside the server, but that has to be done carefully since 
it opens potential security holes.  But GSL is the main reason why 
we're talking about a 3.0 release instead of a 2.6 release.

Xitami is not an isolated product.  It is based on a technical 
platform that we (iMatix) use very heavily for our internal products 
and a couple of commercial ones (like STEP).  This means that while 
the specific web/ftp functionality of Xitami will probably not get 
much richer until we (iMatix again) find we can base commercial work 
on Xitami, the internals will continue to get more robust and more 
interesting over time.

Finally, I'd like to thank everyone on this list, and the many other 
people who use Xitami, for their patience.  Xitami is as much a 
reflection of the people who use it as it is of the people who wrote 
it.
