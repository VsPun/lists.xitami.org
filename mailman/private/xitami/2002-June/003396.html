<PRE>Hi all,
I am running xitami now for severall months on BeOS and i must say it works 
wonderfull stable and reliable.

Just a few things i ran into with Xitami.

1) Aliases won't work good with scripts(PHP)
As I was browsing through the old list messages it seems that it is known,
Any fix for that besides setting up virtual hosts? i haven't tried that yet 
but might do that just the same if there is no alternative.

2) A straight symlink(folderbrowsing) that is capitalized partly won't go any 
further and replies with the message that it can't find that page/url. If I 
change it all to small letters it's fine (not the symlink they are presented 
with a First capitol letter too even if small letters are used.
How can i change or avoid that behaviour within the server, i am not that 
fond to change all downloads and folders for example systemwide to small 
letters.
I tried the setting for unsafe names like in windows recommended. didn't work 
out.

3) When a dot is in the url and folderbrowsing is on, the page genaration 
displays the asci code for the &quot;.&quot; for example, any possable solution for 
this to solve that? Or is it just the gsl scripting that's behaving like 
that?

For all the remaining i haven't encountered a full userfriendlier web/ftp 
server as Xitami,
great job and like to thank Imatix for the good work.

Grts,
Ted.
