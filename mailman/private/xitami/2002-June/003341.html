<PRE>Sean:

There could be several problems here:

1.  Many cable modem ISP's block the ports below 1024, at which point 
the typical SSL port (443) would be blocked also.  Therefore, you need 
to redirect to a different port.  It is easy!  First you need to change your 
typical port number in the SSL control file (sslhttp.cfs).  The port 
number variable is under the first section labeled [Server].  CHange it to 
anything you would like (for example, 2443).  From now on, instead of 
sending ssl requests to <A HREF="https://www.southbroadwaytropicals.com,">https://www.southbroadwaytropicals.com,</A> you 
would send the requests to <A HREF="https://southbroadwaytropicals.com:2443.">https://southbroadwaytropicals.com:2443.</A>

2.  If you want to know for sure that port 443 is blocked, go to 
www.tzo.com and download their app, Port Detective.  It will run through 
all the typical ports and tell you which ones are blocked.

3.  Finally, check the final line of the sslhttp.cfs file, in the section 
labeled [Virtual_hosts].  You must give it the IP addy of your 
connection.  The instructions actually read that you must use actual IP 
addresses; though, I have used domain names (since we have a 
dynamic IP), and have found that it works for us.... though, I have no 
guarantees for anyone else.

Hope this helps.

Sincerely,
Brad Smith, CFO
