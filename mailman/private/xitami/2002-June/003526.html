<PRE>I can think of two ways to do what you are thinking.  You can use vhost to assign 
different web pages to different drives.  You can set in Xitami what drive and where to 
put it's webpages directory.  If you want a low level drive letter fix I suggest a util based 
on SUBST.  SUBST.EXE was originaly created for the old DOS (when we had lots of 
tiny drives ;).  What it does is make a &quot;Drive&quot; (say D: drive) into a directory on another 
hard drive.  Using subst.exe (or a up to date GPL port as MS does not include this any 
more) you could take your E: drive and make it the &quot;webpages&quot; directory of 
&quot;c:\xitami\webpages&quot; or wherever you wanted to put it.  I haven't had a need for it 
recently.  But I still have a copy of SUBST120 on my hard drive (this is a version for 
OS/2) I got off hobbes.  If you are running WIN9x/ME then you will want to look for a 
DOS copy.  If your running WIN2000/NT/XP then you'll want a NT version.  I usialy find 
remakes of these drivers on yahoo through third party programers who found it useful, 
made it, and then put it up GPL.  Good luck and hope that helps!
