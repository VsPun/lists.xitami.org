  Hello,

  I'm new to the list, but have not seen ANY posts since I've joined. I'm 
not sure how it works, and if I'm doing wrong someone please let me know.

  I have several questions regarding the xitami server, but until I'm sure 
I'm doing this right, I will limit it to just one for now.

  Whenever I build a new directory on my site, (for example): &quot;home&quot;, and 
fill it with pages such as pages: one, two and three, to access these pages 
you would go to www.mydomain/home/one.html, or www.mydomain/home/two.html, 
etc..  However, if someone simply types in: www.mydomain/home/  and hits 
enter, a page is shown as that root directory, and lists all of the files 
within that folder.  Is there any way to hide that page as the root 
directory?  I would like it if users could NOT access that page showing that 
whole folders contents, by individual files!  My reason for this is that I 
often keep dupes, and experimental pages inside the same folder as is 
public, and I would like for the user to only be able to access files that I 
create a link to.  I hope I explained this well enough for &quot;someone&quot; to 
answer it!  Thanks in advance for any help with this!  Once again, if I am 
posting wrong, or going about this wrong, please let me know so I can 
correct it!  Good day all!

  John Qualls
