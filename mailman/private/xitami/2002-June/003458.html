<PRE> Your bit below, about SSL and VHosting?  This means that b/c I have 8
domains sharing one IP address that SSL will prevent my Vhosts from working?

Example A: my example config would be: (server has ONE IP addresses,
x.x.x.10)
<A HREF="http://www.domain1.com">http://www.domain1.com</A> = domain1.cfg
<A HREF="http://www.domain2.com">http://www.domain2.com</A> = domain2.cfg
<A HREF="https://www.domain3.com">https://www.domain3.com</A> = domain3.cfg
<A HREF="http://www.domain4.com">http://www.domain4.com</A> = domain4.cfg

A1: Wlll  this not work?
A2: Or does each domain have to have its own IP address (is this because of
SSL and reverse DNS issues?)

Example B: What about within a domain (aliasing SSL directories) :
<A HREF="http://www.domain1.com">http://www.domain1.com</A>
<A HREF="http://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/">http://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/</A>
<A HREF="https://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/secure">https://www.domain1.com/cgi-bin/secure</A>  (SSL secure path)
<A HREF="http://www.domain1.com/pages">http://www.domain1.com/pages</A>

B1: Can SSL work in this fashion?
B2: Or will the whole doamin be SSL referenced by: https:// ?

B3. If the answer to B1 is YES, then will A1 still work in relation to
Example A.

Thanks again guys...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Ok, folks need some serious help here, i don't have a lot of time to do
</I>&gt;<i> research on this - so I need the crash course.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I am running the normal Xitami and am upgrading to Xitami Pro.  As usual,
</I>&gt;<i> there is hardly ANY documentation on how to do this step by step.  Do I
</I>&gt;<i> install to same directory OR do I install to a new directory and copy my
</I>&gt;<i> previous configs/directory structure over?  Because it is the Pro version
</I>&gt;<i> does that mean EVERY site is going to be a secure site - or can I only
</I>turn
&gt;<i> the secure feature on for specific pages or links within each site?  Are
</I>&gt;<i> there tricky configurations I need to be aware of.  I do know I am
</I>supposed
&gt;<i> to get a KEY from somewhere, but again, I don't understand this process.
</I>I
&gt;<i> don't want to disrupt my current installation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To really understand SSL, you really should read the HTTPS RFC.  However,
</I>&gt;<i> since you are in a time crunch, let me take you quickly through what is
</I>&gt;<i> involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First off, your entire site can be run under SSL/TLS (if you want).  The
</I>&gt;<i> tricky part is to remember that the SSL/TLS protocol provides no means for
</I>&gt;<i> VHosting except by IP address under Xitami Pro.  This is due to the nature
</I>&gt;<i> of the SSL/TLS protocols and not Xitami.  The problem is that when an
</I>&gt;<i> SSL-capable client connects, the SSL server certificate that gets sent is
</I>&gt;<i> the one tied to the IP address and there is no way to determine what VHost
</I>&gt;<i> the client wants until after authentication.  This is, IMO, the biggest
</I>&gt;<i> blunder the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) ever made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, all of your current configuration files can be the same as for
</I>&gt;<i> Xitami.  The SSL config is located in HTTPSSL.CFS (or something like
</I>that).
&gt;<i>  Just edit the SSL config to point at the proper certificates needed for
</I>&gt;<i> the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, you need a certificate chain.  This will consist of a root
</I>&gt;<i> certificate authority encrypted private key (e.g. Verisign) and your own
</I>&gt;<i> certificate that is signed by the owner of the private key of the root
</I>&gt;<i> cert.  You need both the encrypted server private key and unencrypted
</I>&gt;<i> server private key in order to get Xitami Pro to work.  Let me warn you
</I>&gt;<i> that Verisign signed certs. are *EXTREMELY* expensive and there are
</I>cheaper
&gt;<i> alternatives to using their certs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I am in a bind and need to upgrade fast b/c one of my sites needs to do
</I>&gt;<i> Credit Card transactions.  So any and all help is very appreciated.  I
</I>have
&gt;<i> never worked with SSL and I am worried about the time involved to get this
</I>&gt;<i> all working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Make sure that your user has a merchant account before going to the
</I>trouble
&gt;<i> of setting up SSL so quickly.  If they don't have a merchant account, it
</I>&gt;<i> will take them about 2-3 weeks (minimum) to get one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps!
