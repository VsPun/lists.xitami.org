Yup.  (char *), (int *), (void *), (struct
MyReallyExtraSillyLargeNameForAStruct *)

Sorry, I've had a rough day and figured I would share it with you.

I would recommend XiFusion, except I have the only version of that sitting
on my computer that will do what you want (XiFusion v2.6).  However, I'm
not sharing it with anyone until I get SSL capabilities on my website
(Everybody say &quot;Hi&quot; to Craig, the web-host guy :) (Please, don't e-mail
him, he's got enough problems from me &lt;chuckles to self&gt;).  That's only
part of the reason, but the other reason is that I need to get my hands on
a Linux box for 2 minutes to compile and test it there.

The problem with most applications written for PHP is that they are not
written for PHP as a CGI, but rather PHP as a module (specifically as an
Apache module).  When PHP is run as a CGI, it acts differently enough to
cause problems such as the ones you are having (I've noticed that
re-direction is a major problem with PHP under Xitami).  XiFusion v2.5 does
some re-direction handling, but it won't always work and even fails in some
cases.  XiFusion v2.6 deals with every re-direction issue that has risen in
the past but is somewhat slower because the approach to re-direction has
changed.

Hope this helps!
