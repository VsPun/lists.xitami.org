</I>&gt;<i>PATH= statement - I wonder what other programs are supposed to be 
</I>&gt;<i>listed?
</I>
Umm...re-install PHP?  If you are missing items in your PHP.INI file, you
either copied the wrong one (e.g. the optimized INI, try using the default
INI file), the installation of PHP is corrupt (unlikely), you are using a
different version of PHP than what SquirrelMail works with (unlikely - but
if this is the case, I would download the latest CVS repository), or you
have drastically changed the PHP config from the default settings (most
likely).

My first suggestion is to uninstall PHP and re-install it.  SquirrelMail
should work when PHP is properly installed.  Copy php4ts.dll from c:\php to
c:\winnt\system32 (or c:\windows\system32 - depends on the OS).  Copy
php.ini-dist from c:\php to c:\winnt and rename it to php.ini.  Finally,
don't touch the INI settings.  Now, in the [Filters] section of Xitami make
sure PHP is defined (hand-edit the config to rule out web-admin-based
problems):

[Filters]
  .php=c:\php\php.exe

Restart the OS (this guarantees that all loaded DLLs are flushed from
memory).  Run the following PHP script across localhost:

&lt;?
phpinfo();
?&gt;

If that doesn't work, something is:

1)  Inherently wrong with your ability to follow directions (unlikely).
2)  Xitami is corrupt (unlikely, but try re-installing it - install the
latest stable release so that we are on the same page - I'm using 2.4d9
locally).

OR
3)  Your OS is corrupt (most likely - I've never heard of anyone having
this much trouble with the PHP/Xitami combination - not even with the beta
versions of Xitami).  The only solution to this is to try standard OS
repair utilities (e.g. installing IE - IE has kernel patches embedded
within the installation program).  If the registry is shot, then there is
no solution except to re-install the OS or drop an installation image.

Once PHP is working, modify the INI to properly support session management:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2)  Locate 'session.save_path = /tmp' in the PHP.INI file and change it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'session.save_path = c:\temp'.
</I>
Next, re-install SquirrelMail.  Run the config.pl script and configure it.
Run SquirrelMail on Xitami.

If all of that doesn't work, then something is wrong at a level lower than
software (your hardware is messed up - or something is interfering with
Xitami/PHP such as a virus or firewall software).

Hope this helps!
