My Ximtami service stopped. This was in my crash.log:

-------------------------------------
26/Oct/2006:11:58:33 -0800 Xitami v2.4d9

Abort at smttran:Get-Buffer-From-Socket: (File-Buffer-In,

Abort at smtftpc:Write-User-Logged-In: (Have-Password, Ok-Event)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This was while running the ftp server and transferring serveral files at the
same time.

Any ideas?

Yes. Don't use the built-in FTP server. There are many great full-
featured free FTP servers out there for every platform you can think 
of, and Xitami's FTP server never were meant for anything other than 
very light-duty work anyway (even Imatix people have said this). It 
can, and eventually will, crash.

On Windows, GuildFTPd or WarFTPd are some excellent choices.

I want to revisit this, I must not have something set up properly. When I
run xigui32 everything is fine. When I run xiwinnt it doesn't seem to pick
up my config files. Anyone have any idea?

Okay something else strange.

I decided to try loading Xitami as a service on a server where I have been
running xigui32.exe. Once started now I get different pages, I'm not sure
what yet but I'm investigating. Shouldn''t I get the same pages?

Here is the only thing i can think of that could cause this.

1:)Do you have 2 or more copys of Xitami installed?
2:)If so are you starting xigui32.exe and xiwinnt from the same folder?

If this is not the cause it. Then I'm very interested in what caused this.

2 is the most likely problem I think

IIRC there are some start up options that can allow you to specify the
base directory but you'll have to RTM to get them right.

Huh? What IIRC and RTM? 

Are you talking about the setting in the Xitami.cfg? If so it should be the
same no matter which one I run, right?

And like you, it doesn't make since to me why its not working right. One
installation of Xitami.

If I recall correctly. (But you'll have to) Read The Manual

You need to make sure that the service version is finding the
xitami.cfg in the first place and I think you can do that by
specifying a command line option. Unfortunately I forget which as I
haven't bothered with the service version for years

I guess I'm getting old. I figured RTM was Read the Manual of course I
remember it as RTFM. Goes back to my military days. But I never saw IIRC I
guess because I don't do chat. So you'll have to teach us old farts. I'll

I'm no expert but,

Are xigui32.exe & xiwinnt.exe in the same folder/directory as xitami.cfg?
If not do you have the same xitami.cfg in both folder/directories?

C:\xitami-25\app\xigui32.exe
C:\xitami-25\app\xitami.cfg

C:\xitami\app\xiwinnt.exe
C:\xitami\app\xitami.cfg

Did you uninstall the service by running "xisrv32.exe -u" before running 
xiwinnt.exe?

Alex, B.,

    I asked this this question a few weeks ago but no one ansered back. So let me try again.

Dear Friends,

    I have a grayhat situation:

    I have a Cobut Server that a hacker has found a way to use to send out his spam though. I have finger out most of what I need to do to stop him. But I believe that it will only make him more persistent to find another way to use my server. So I need to take this opportunity to learn how to make my server more secure. One of the thing that I have learned is that most hackers use  a system to "Tor" to Protect there identity. So I need to install a copy of Tor on my Local computer (which also had Xitami) so I can learn how it works, what the effects on my Cobut Server are so I can learn how to identity its use, and if there is a way I can defeat it.

    HEAR IS MY PROBLEM.

    I was just about to install Tor on my Computer When I noticed that there Privoxy 3.0.3 (witch is part of the Tor packeg) Happen to work like a server and used Localhost, and the ip 127.0.0.1, the same address my Xitami uses, (See instructions for yourself http://tor.eff.org/docs/tor-doc-web.html.en) . Now my question. Will there be a conflict between Xitami and the Provoxy, and if so dos anyone know how to move the Provoxy out of the way, Since Xitami if Primary on my machine and I have written dozens of script referring to Xitami as the Localhost.


Sincerely,

Stefan

Have you thought of setting port 85 as the standard connect port for 
Xitami?  As far as Tor our web and IRC servers ban Tor on connect.  
We've had to many problems with spammers using it for abuse.

Yeah that's the odd part. I will try your suggestion of uninstalling,
Correct me if I'm wrong but xiwinnt IS the service version right?

I'm no expert but,

Are xigui32.exe & xiwinnt.exe in the same folder/directory as xitami.cfg?
If not do you have the same xitami.cfg in both folder/directories?

C:\xitami-25\app\xigui32.exe
C:\xitami-25\app\xitami.cfg

C:\xitami\app\xiwinnt.exe
C:\xitami\app\xitami.cfg

Did you uninstall the service by running "xisrv32.exe -u" before running 
xiwinnt.exe?

According to 
http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/2003-February/004729.html
in some versions of xitami "xiwinnt.exe" IS the server version.

What version are you running?

I'm running v2.5b4 & v2.5c2 & neither has "xiwinnt.exe".

Thank you all for your feedback.

Yes, Spamming is the problem, The Hacker had been using tor (or something
Like it) to get my Cobult server to send out his spam. So that why I'm
trying to learn about it. So I can find a way to Identify an attack and stop
it.

Thanks again and I will let you know if I have more questions.

I have v2.5c2 but I think I upgraded at some point in time from v2.4
something or other. So I should be installing xisvr32 instead?

Before my ISP was switched to Comcast & port 80 was blocked, with 
xicpl32.cpl  in the
C:\windows\system32 directory I ran xisrv32.exe -i to start xitami as a 
service & xisrv32.exe -u to stop the service.

To just run it as a test server I just run xigui32.exe

There are DNSBLs for the detection of Tor proxies and well as published 
IP lists.  If you are being hacked it's not just a Tor problem though.  
It sounds like he has found a security hole in your system he could 
access just as easily from another proxy (exploited machine, worm, 
etc).  How is he sending out spam?

There are 2 ways that this has happened. One is a real hack, and the other
is simple hole in a program I wrote.
1) I discovered programs that allow telnet access though http, database
manipulation, and email management. that were not put on the server Not by
me. I have removed these programs, changed the passwords. So far they have
not returned, but that my be because of #2.
2) The hacker had figured out how to use one of my programs to send out his
mail. Since I wrote it. I was able to modify it to recorded his actions,
store the %ENV's. (I'm still trying to finger out how you are able to
acquire a visitors email address). that's when I noticed the his IPs were
never the same twice, plus no response from cookies, no calling for images
from the web page the script creates, and that's what lead me to tor.
I don't see any other actions they have taken when they were on my server,
and since they think there getting one over on me by using one of my own
scripts (which is accessible though http, so they don't require full
accesses to my box), I've got the advantage, so far. As long as they keep
trying to submit enters to my script, I still have the opportunity to track
them down.

Can you tell me more about DNSBL?

Stefan.

Subject: [Xitami] Block Multiple Failed FTP Passwords
Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.20061116111548.008313b0@mail.shalomca.com>

Is there a way to automatically block (either temporarily or permanently)
an IP address after multiple FTP password errors? We are running Xitami
Version 2.4b2 on Windows 95. Our FTP logs show that sometimes we get
thousands of FTP password attempts from the same IP. I would like to
automatically restrict or block this kind of attack. In other words after
several failed password attempts from the same IP I would like Xitami to
block further connections from that IP either permanently or for 10-20
minutes.

Reason why I want to run as a service, if the server reboots because of a
power outage or something like that when I'm not home, then Xitami will
start as long as the PC is running even if it's not logged in. 

By the way, I don't know why I came up as General.

Before my ISP was switched to Comcast & port 80 was blocked, with 
xicpl32.cpl  in the
C:\windows\system32 directory I ran xisrv32.exe -i to start xitami as a 
service & xisrv32.exe -u to stop the service.

To just run it as a test server I just run xigui32.exe

General purpose, General screw up, General Lee Stupid, General Electric,

Generally I don't go for nicknames but I could keep it. Besides I had a

Oh Well!

Message-ID: <11689a700611250050y6a7869bcy837c27eddb072cb9@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

i've been using xitami for a few years, to host a number of
independently-owned sites and domains for others, in various locations
around the globe.  each web-masters on the service, simply supplies their
user-name/password combo to log directly into their designated web-directory
(via xitami's ftp) to edit or make changes to their site.  this all seems to
work very well.

my problem, is that some of these web-masters (upon supplying an incorrect
password) report finding themselves logged into the ftp-root...
anonymously... and get confused because they can't find their files.

i would like to completely disable anonymous logins (and the ftp
root) altogether, as i'm only interested in supplying ftp-service to my
authorized web-masters... and only if they've supplied a valid user-name and
password.

i simply don't want to be providing bandwidth or resources, or handling
ftp-connections for just any tom, dick, or harry-bot, who happens to hit me
on port-21.  i see it as a security threat.  i would prefer if xitami-ftp
simply did not respond to anyone without a user-name and password... because
they aren't supposed to be there to begin with.

is it possible to 'disable' the ftp-root in such a manner?

if so, i'd really appreciate a few pointers in tweaking up my config.

thanks!

rick

You ought to disable Xitami's FTP completely. Its a pretty unreliable
implementation. If you replace it with some other ftpd you can then
make sure that only non-anonymous users have access

thank you francis,

on a recent recommendation from someone here on the list, i decided to take
a quick look at guild-ftp.  it's a very impressive looking piece of software
indeed, but i eventually decided to abort that idea, due to my lack of
understanding how 'normal' ftp services function.  though i've been using
ftp regularly for the past 10 or 11 years, i've never actually belonged to
an ftp file-share 'group' as such... and just don't get the whole concept of
the 'normal' format.  the virtual directories (pub, guest, upload, etc.)
really confuse me, as i fail to understand their unique purpose from a
user's point if view.  previously, whether i've been hosting or being
hosted, ftp has served strictly as a tool for the manipulation of password
protected web-content.  because i consider my ftp requirements to be
somewhat 'light duty', i decided to scrap the whole guild-ftp idea, and not
try to fix something that wasn't necessarily broken.

if any of you run a 'fully functional' ftp service, or know of any such
public services that i could test-drive (as a user), i would kindly
appreciate an invite :).  i'm sure i could learn a lot from a little
hands-on experience.

thanks!

rick

Guild is pretty easy to understand and once you get past the initial 
setup woes, which are easy to overcome, it's maintenance-free.

Think of the virtual directories as links... you can tie together 
many different directories, from different drives, with differing 
connectivity, to one document root (as far as the user is concerned). 
For a FTP site that's crucial.

Rick,

I am using FileZilla server and client and it is pretty straight forward. I am not an ftp guru 
either, but it works pretty well. The nice thing which I like with file zilla server, you can set 
the IP's you want to connect to the server, if this is desired and possible (dyn IP customers ?)

I would have to dig up my notes as I had it installed, and didn't look into it anymore. It is here 
with a few users like running: Start it up > forget it as it is running just fine. I am maybe not 
running the actual version, but....

http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/

thank you kindly johannes (and magnus),

for all the great information and words of encouragement ;)

i believe another question of mine was addressed here as well, and that's my
concerns about the stability of these applications, and their ability to run
unattended for extended periods of time on older hardware, without chewing
up a lot of resources and bogging down.

i will most likely install these on a test-system first, and play around a
bit... until i finally get a good feel for what's going on, and what they're
all about... and go from there.

thanks again!  :)

rick
