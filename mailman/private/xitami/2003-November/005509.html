<PRE>  Hello Daniel,

  No, I have nothing on the XP machine, other than whatever may be built 
into the O/S itself..  I simply downloaded into a clean machine, ran the 
Windows install, and it appeared to be set up right!  And if I were the only 
one testing it, I still would not know otherwise, because as I mentioned, it 
is accessable to me, using all methods!!   Yes, Daniel, they have tried 
&quot;every&quot; way I know of.. They've tried: <A HREF="http://www.mysite.com,">http://www.mysite.com,</A> 
www.mysite.com,  mysite.com, as well as the numerical address; ie: 
xx.xx.xx.xxx and <A HREF="http://xx.xx.xx.xxx">http://xx.xx.xx.xxx</A> ..  &quot;ALL OF THEM&quot; to no avail..  And 
yes, one friend  DID attempt to ping it, and it came back: unable to 
establish connection, or failure to recognize..  &quot;?&quot; or something like that! 
  As if it were NOT there!!   I have always had such good luck with Xitami 
&quot;out of the box&quot; that this has thrown me for a loop!  Thanks allot Daniel, 
for ANY HELP you might be able to offer, so I can find out what I need to do 
to get my site online!  Have  a good day sir!

Are you running any firewalls or routers?  Are your friends typing in a
URL or an IP?  If a URL then do you have the URL mapped to your IP?  Can
your friends ping your IP?

  What a mistake this change was!  Is it even possible to get Xitami to
run=20
on XP home?  It installed fine, and I thought was going to run.   All=20
addresses point to it from &quot;my&quot; machine!  However NONE of the urls,=20
addresses point to my service from remote uses machines! Can anyone
please=20
help direct me to the problem?  It's hard because I have had to get
others=20
to keep trying to access my site, because I can type localhost,=20
xxx.xxx.xxx.xx, the actual url,  and they all seem to work just as well
as=20
any I've seen..  But when others try it,, &quot;cannot connect&quot;, and it's as
if=20
it's not even there!  Thank you for any help or advice you might offer!
Have=20
a good day!

  harth
