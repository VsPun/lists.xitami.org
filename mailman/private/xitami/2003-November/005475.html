<PRE>&gt;<i> I've seen a couple of  comments here concerning a potential problem with
</I>&gt;<i> email addresses in the archive.  But no one has mentioned the
</I>&gt;<i> registration requirements for forums.  In the case of the InReview site,
</I>&gt;<i> reading their &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;, shows you have no privacy from them or
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else they want to give your information to.  Considering all of
</I>&gt;<i> the pop-up ads they have, I'm sure my already over-burdened spam filter
</I>&gt;<i> would be getting an additional workout, if I was foolish enough to
</I>&gt;<i> register with them.  The ads are bad enough, but I understand that
</I>&gt;<i> something has to pay their bills, but a blatant we can do anything we
</I>&gt;<i> want with your information is totally unacceptable.
</I>
I agree, and I would be totally opposed to a forum that is hosted by one of
the &quot;free&quot; forum hosting services. They generally suck, and when they decide
to close their doors, you lose all the archives.

A forum can easily be set up and run on the Xitami web site, at no
additional cost. Then, iMatix can determine exactly how they want to set it
up. I run a forum on my web site (I test the scripts with Xitami!) -- I do
not require registration, posts can be anonymous (no email req'd), there are
no advertisers/sponsors/pop-ups, and all posts are emailed to subscribers.
Even non-subscribers who post a question, can select to have replies to that
question emailed to them, without having to subscribe to the forum.
