<PRE>Well actualy he does know what he's talking about.  As I said 
earlier CHMOD is a Linux/Unix command function that does not 
exist on Win systems.  Under windows the normal settings is all 
&quot;programs&quot; have access to read/write to all of your hard drive.  
Thus Xitami can read/write/execute any file you have given it 
access too.  A Unix shell account has more security so you have to 
CHMOD or give permissions to each individual file as to what 
access you will allow.  

Most CGI writers understand this and allow for this.  They 
recommend you to chmod on *nix systems and just install and go 
on Win systems as the permissions already exist.  This IS the case 
as I run a web page hosting site under Xitami and many users have 
installed their own forums (PHPBB, Ikonboard, PHPNUKE, Xoops, 
etc) without the need for CHMOD.

If you are still having problems I would guess this to be one of two 
issues.  The script is writen for *nix only.  Some writers only wish to 
support free OS or have nothing to do with Windows so do not 
support it.  The other possibility is your Xitami is not running as 
&quot;Administrarors&quot; and your setup is blocking access to something 
based on a security setting.  You can check these settings under 
Control Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;Local Security Settings.  An 
easier way to do this may be to the the &quot;Cacls&quot; command to give 
Admin privlidges to your Xitami directories.

If you have a script that wishes a file read only use Windows 
Explorer and right-click the file, chose properties and chose read-
only.

I've installed quite a few online forums and none so far have 
required Chmod unless they ran under unix.

this is not done automatically, once the file have been uploaded to

can prove me wrong, and direct me to an example or a
