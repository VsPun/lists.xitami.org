Hello Michael,

On Fri, 07 Nov 2003 09:37:07 +0000 your time, you said:

MG&gt; Sorry but i don't think you know what you are talking about

Friendly aren't you :-/

MG&gt; to  be  able  to run a forum or chat room, using a 'flat file' the
MG&gt; user  need  to  have  permission  to  write  to  a file where they
MG&gt; messages are stored

Well  I'm  afraid  you  are mistaken about what you think you know, or
there  is  a misunderstanding about what is being discussed. I suggest
you download YaBB 1 Gold SP1 and try it yourself if you have any doubt
about setting up forums on W2K without the need for CHMOD.

MG&gt; this  is  not done automatically, once the file have been uploaded
MG&gt; to a server the permissions need to be changed

Nope, not on W2K it doesn't. You can't! Simple as that. If you need to
set  permissions  in W2K you'll have to do it the Windows way, not via
CHMOD.

MG&gt; i  would  love  it  if you can prove me wrong, and direct me to an
MG&gt; example or a demonstration where this is not the case.

Well my forums are at forums.infowizard.co.uk but they are private and
contain  private postings so I'm afraid I can't give you access to put
you mind at rest.

MG&gt; Ps  What is the point of this so called forum, i thought it was to
MG&gt; help  with xitami

This  is  a  mailing  list, not a web board. It is the *Xitami mailing
list*.

MG&gt; so far i have not recieved any and i am about to unscribe.

That's your prerogative of course. Patience is a virtue of course, and
as  this  is  a user list you can't expect people to be around 24/7 to
answer   every   query   instantly.   I  am  certain  that  there  are
knowledgeable people on this list who can help you, but you'll have to
spell  out  what  it  is  you  want  and  work with them to solve your
problem.

Sl=E1n,

 Simon @ i~n+f~o+w~i+z~a+r~d+.~c+o~.+u~k
