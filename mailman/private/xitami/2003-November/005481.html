<PRE>Folks,

Coincidentally with the discussions here, we have been in the process 
of setting up a forum web site (using phpbb) which will include a 
place for Xitami.  The site will be on forums.imatix.org, and will be 
our way of supporting people who use our free software (not just 
Xitami).

I can't say whether this list will still be what people prefer or 
not, there are arguments for and against lists.  Personally I would 
like to see the list continue but I suspect that over time forums are 
easier to use, searchable, and simply provide richer ways to discuss 
complex issues.

In any case we will host the forum site, it will be central point of 
contact for all the users of our free software - Xitami being the 
most popular but not the only one.

To our loyal and patient users, I'd like to say thank you, first of 
all, and secondly to say that while we're a small team and we can't 
spend an enormous effort in improving and extending Xitami, we 
continue to work on it, find and fix bugs, make it more secure and 
more stable, and add features to it little by little.  Our own 
products depend more and more on Xitami, and this is because we 
believe in it.

This list, in particular, has been a remarkable source of information 
and help to Xitami users: a simple but solid lifeline to the hundreds 
of thousands of people to whom Xitami was not easy, nor obvious.  You 
helped make it so.  Thank you all.
