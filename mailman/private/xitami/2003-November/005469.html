</I>&gt;<i> (and every other month.)  The URL at the bottom of EVERY mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> message points at the list general information page, from where you can
</I>&gt;<i> unsubscribe, view the list archives, etc.  One of the options for
</I>&gt;<i> viewing each month's archives is &quot;threaded&quot;.

Interesting... I saw the link at the bottom of the emails, but it was not at
all apparent that I needed to click &quot;unsubscribe&quot; to get to the archives. I
had previously gotten to the old archives, which were not threaded, by
digging around the Xitami web page. Not sure why there is no link there for
the newer archives. But even the newer archives are not well organized, and
I don't see a method of searching.

One easy thing to do with forums, is to email all messages to subscribers.
Then, if a subscriber wants to reply, the message can include a link which
takes him directly to the forum, and even to a &quot;reply&quot; page for that
particular message. Then there is no need to log in, and replying is just as
easy as replying to an email.

In other words, a forum can give you everything that the current list-server
offers, plus maintain far better organization, and have good archive
searching.
