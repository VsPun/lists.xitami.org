<PRE>Are you saying that you do not have access to the Xitami Server on Win2k?
Then who installed it? Is there not someone who can just walk up to the
server and make the change? If it is your server you should set up some
remote software like rAdmin from www.famatech.com that way you can remote
into the Win2k server and change permissions. That's what I do. If it's not
my server then I ask the administrator to do it.

Sorry but i don't think you know what you are talking about, to be able to
run a forum or chat room, using a 'flat file' the user need to have
permission to write to a file where they messages are stored, this is not
done automatically, once the file have been uploaded to a server the
permissions need to be changed, i would love it if you can prove me wrong,
and direct me to an example or a demonstration where this is not the case.

Thanks

Ps What is the point of this so called forum, i thought it was to help with
xitami so far i have not recieved any and i am about to unscribe.

I am so disapointed that you can make of my spelling what you will

Hello Michael,

On Thu, 06 Nov 2003 12:32:09 +0000 your time, you said:

MG&gt; Easier  said  than  done,  i  have tried using cuteftp but i get a
MG&gt; message  command  not  implemented....

Well  I  wouldn't  do  that  just  yet. If you are running Xitami on a
Windows OS you don't do anything. CHMOD isn't supported, and you don't
need to set permissions, usually. It should work OK as is.

I  have  CGI forums setup under Xitami on a W2K Pro machine and didn't
need to set any permissions for the files, so I imagine the same would
apply for your script.
