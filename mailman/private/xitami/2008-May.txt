I have Xitami running on Vista and it's constantly down. So I guess it's
halfast running. I think it stayed up for a maximum of 2 days once before
going down but seems to go down at least daily. I'm also running Always Up
and it can't even keep it running. As much as I hate to say this because I
do love Xitami, I think I'm going to have to move off of it. It's that or go
back to XP I think. Unless I run the server on my wife's computer which is
still XP. 

Anyone have any ideas? (for running it on Vista that is?)

As far as Vista goes, I really like it BUT!!!!

Ron

Not that I am about to move my business to Windows latest untested, 
unsupported and bug filled OS, but it is a good question. Anyone?

wow, who knew Vista would be the death of Xitami.  But interestingly, concerning Vista, you are the first person I have ever heard say "I really like it.."

I pulled back to version 2.4 and it solved the crash problems I was having
on VISTA.
The basic problem with VISTA is the security "enhancements".  I have to
disable most of the new enhancements to use VISTA.

I don't see that much different under the hood, it's just XP with a paint
job IMHO. However in saying that there must be something going on. Of course
I had problems before Vista and is why I got Always Up. Because Xitami
stopped so much I had to do something to restart it when I wasn't here. I am
however going to keep it up and running for awhile because I think Always Up
will keep it going for me after I reloaded the exe. We'll see, it's only
been one day so far.
