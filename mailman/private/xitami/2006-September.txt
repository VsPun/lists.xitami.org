I have been trying to get my log files working, but everything except 
xitami.log gets generated with nothing in them. I have checked my 
settings and all seems fine. Deleting all the log files and then 
startying up Xitami causes them all to get generated, but no matter what 
I try they never contain data. Any ideas please?

Has xitami died? Is there anyone left using it? Anyone there?

Les, maybe nobody has an answer, and that is why you are not getting a 
response. I am using windows, and have never had any file come up empty when 
writing to it. However, I used to have my websites hosted by computers that 
were running Linux, and I would have that problem happen from time to time, 
and it would not go away until I alerted their tech to the problem. More 
than that, I do not know.......... JR

Actually, I have had a  problem with log files for years.  I asked for help
and I got the same blank response.  No one else seems to have any problems
with the log files except you and me, I guess.

The only time I have had a blank access.log during the 6 years I've been 
running Xitami is when my ISP blocked port 80  or a new firewall blocked 
access & no one could connect.

It would help to know:
What version you are using?
What operating system is it running on?
Are you running it locally or on a remote computer?

If you are running locally, that is on your computer:
 is a connection to 127.0.0.1 recorded?
can anyone actually connect to your web site?

Thanks to all those who responded. I have emailed imatix about the 
future or status of xitami development and support, and have as yet 
received no reply. I believe nothing has happened in the way of 
development with xitami since late 2004. I do really wonder whether 
there is any point in continuing to use xitami, and as I have need for 
ssl, I was considering xitami pro.

2.5, perhaps I should step back to the last 2.4 stable? Are there any 
security issues if I do?

Win2k

Yes, everything works fine except for log files are always empty.

Why don't you post your logging config?

For example, here is mine from defaults.cfg:

[Accesslog]
    Cycle=1
    Cycle-arg=D:\logs\Xitami\access.log
    Cycle-how=3
    Cycle-time=00:10
    Format=CLFX

[Errorlog]
    Cycle=1
    Cycle-arg=D:\logs\Xitami\errors.log
    Cycle-how=3
    Cycle-time=00:15
    Format=CLFX

[Server]
...
    log-dir=D:\logs\Xitami
...

Interestingly enough, those entries do not exist in any form in my 
defaults.cfg, nor in the cfgs for each of the virtual hosts. I know that 
I have made the entries in the web based admin to enable and format the 
logs. So the root might be somethign to do with how xitami is writing to 
the defaults.cfg file?

i have never like the web based interface and have read about people having
trouble with it many times over the years that i've been on this list.

manually editing the cfg files it quick and simple. that is how i have
always done my confguring.

The answer to this was posted way back in 2004 by Pieter Hintjens 
(see large quote below). Xitami is since long obsoleted for 
production environments BUT for one task: serving up static content, 
where it's still a very good choice thanks to its blazing speed (even 
on low-end systems). I think Zeus is faster still, but Zeus costs 
money. Xitami easily outperforms Apache in a smaller footprint, but 
Apache easily outperforms Xitami on dynamic content as Xitami needs 
to run everything as CGI processes.

Of course, in specific cases (low powered memory-starved systems) 
Xitami may still be a top choice. As usual for complex questions, the 
answer is "it depends". I'm still running Xitami on my own box for 
development purposes, but might switch to Apache, haven't decided 
yet. My live server runs Apache since a year or so.


***** BEGIN QUOTE *****


Hello, we are here.  Busy, but here.

I'm sorry we don't spend more time reading and replying to the Xitami 
list.  It's one of many things we have to spend time on, and 
inevitably gets less attention that it deserves.  

Xitami is, obviously, a project that is fairly static.  We make 
patches now and then, especially when there are security issues.  The 
server solves a problem for many people but we cannot compete with 
the huge resources put behind products like Apache, and we would be 
foolish to try.  

Allow me to explain briefly where we are and how we got here...

When we started Xitami in 1996 the goal was not to develop a web 
server so much as to demonstrate a way of building servers.  That's 
why it was open source from day 1.  Unfortunately (for our spare time 
and personal lives), we were dragged kicking and screaming into 
developing our prototype into a real working server.  I can speak for 
most of the Xitami team when I say that it has always been a real 
pleasure to see our work used by so many enthusiastic people, but 
that the flip side has been a support burden that rapidly became 
impossible.  

In 2000-01 or so, we were forced to concentrate on earning money: 
this was banal and much less satisfying than making Xitami better but 
the few licenses we sold for Xitami/Pro did not start to cover even 
our network costs, let alone work on the product.  

I've been asked by members of our team to "officially declare Xitami 
dead" several times.  I've resisted.  We use the software ourselves.  
We use it on websites and in products like smt@ (www.sms-at.com), 
which is one of the ways we make a living.  

We spoke to the Apache team in 1999 and were happy to see that they 
were heading towards an architecture like ours: a portability layer, 
a bunch of protocol handlers, a fully portable server.  Today Apache 
2 is a fast, portable server and seriously: you should be using 
Apache 2 instead of Xitami unless there are specific things Xitami 
does better for you.  

At iMatix we're going through the same boom/bust/boom cycles as 
everyone else in the industry.  We made some money in 1999-2001, we 
lost most of it in 2002-2003, and we're now growing again with some 
interesting projects.  So iMatix is definitely here, and will be for 
a long time.  

But... Xitami as a living product... it's clearly something who's 
time has come and gone.  The need for a small, fast, portable web 
server was painfully obvious in 1997-2000, and we are proud to have 
achieved what we did.  But today it's a niche product.  

We will continue to provide updates of Xitami, we will continue to 
publish the source code.  Other people may spend the time building 
binaries and nice installers - this is no longer our job.  

I hope this is a satisfactory answer.

On behalf of the Xitami team, which has included myself, Ewen 
McNeill, Jonathan Schultz, Julie Pesesse, and numerous other people 
in various roles over the years, I'd like to thank our users, friends 
and contributers for their patience and good will.  It has not been 
easy to spend such a huge effort in writing what we consider to be an 
excellent server, and to see it become almost totally irrelevant, but 
your feedback and support over the years has made it worthwhile.

I used the web based interface for about a week. Now I have some dos scripts
that do the work for me. Sure it means I have to be sitting at the server. I
could probably do the same with PHP but I'm too lazy to do it. 

As far as the log files goes.

In the config for each site I have this


[Accesslog]
   Filename = "mysitename.log" 


In the xitami.cfg I have this

#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   ACCESSLOG configuration section
#
#   This section controls the server access log, recording HTTP hits.

[Accesslog]
#   Specifies whether logging is enabled or not.

    enabled=1

someone said something in a previous response that caught my attention.

Does PHP in Xitami get processed thru the CGI engine?  Or does PHP in Xitami truly run as a seperate PHP process?

  For what it's worth - I run Xitami on a Pentium under Windows 2K, and the logs work fine on the machine, with the default settings from the original out-of-the-box install.  All the log controls (max disk usage,  etc) are OK.

  Les, maybe nobody has an answer, and that is why you are not getting a

I had to set permission in the Computer Associates firewall to allow 
http on port 80 when Xitami is running.  When my ISP blocks http ports I 
reset Xitami to watch port 3080 .  If you have a router you need to set 
the router to recognize each computer & set permissions for both. Check 
your router docs for how to do that.

It runs as a CGI process, meaning a PHP.EXE process is started (and 
then killed) for every request. This hurts performance in larger 
scenarios, as it takes considerable CPU time to start new processes. 
In comparison, PHP runs as daemons on Apache and IIS, and is thus 
"always loaded".

Thank you to all who offered help. Editing the defaults.cfg file to 
include proper variables has fixed my problem.

Now all that remains in my mind is if xitami is still a viable option 
for web hosting. I still have not heard from imatix, and I am beginning 
to believe that xitami has been abandoned.

That was covered  back in 2004.
Here is a copy. of the instructions that should work with any version 
that contains the required files.

Subject: RE: [Xitami] Installing Xitami as a service

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to figure
out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you figure out
what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami
2. In the \xitami\win32 folder, copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory.
Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type "cd\xitami" to change to the xitami
directory. Then type "xisrv32.exe -i" to install the service. The service is
now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run "xisrv32.exe -u".

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into services
and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and start it there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you may
need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with an
account that has access.

That was covered  back in 2004.
Here is a copy. of the instructions that should work with any version that
contains the required files.

Subject: RE: [Xitami] Installing Xitami as a service

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to figure
out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you figure out
what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami 2. In the \xitami\win32 folder,
copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory.
Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type "cd\xitami" to change to the xitami
directory. Then type "xisrv32.exe -i" to install the service. The service is
now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run "xisrv32.exe -u".

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into services
and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and start it there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you may
need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with an
account that has access.

Dear Xiti users,

I salute you one and all.

This is in rewsponse to Les' request for an log configuration example:
----------------
[Accesslog]
    Custom = "[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
    Cycle = "weekly"
    Cycle-arg = "past/ac%yy%mm%dd.log"
    Cycle-day = "0"
    Cycle-how = "rename"
    Cycle-lines = "0"
    Cycle-size = "0"
    Cycle-time = "00:00"
    Enabled = "1"
    Filename = "access.log"
    Format = "XLML"
    Header = ""
    Local = "0"
    Translate = "0"

[Errorlog]
    Custom = "<LOG 
<EVENT><DATE></DATE><CLIENT></CLIENT><CLIENTIP></CLIENTIP-
ERVERIP><REQUEST></REQUEST><QUERRY></QUERRY><METHOD></METHOD><SAU>/TTS<EEVD<-
RECEIVED><SENT></SENT><DURATION></DURATION><FILENAE>/FLEAM><SEAGNT</SEAGNT<R-
FERER></REFERER><USERNAME></USERNAME>SERICE</SRVIE><HOS></HOS></VEN> /OG>"
    Cycle = "weekly"
    Cycle-arg = "past/er%yy%mm%dd.log"
    Cycle-day = "0"
    Cycle-how = "rename"
    Cycle-lines = "0"
    Cycle-size = "0"
    Cycle-time = "00:00"
    Enabled = "1"
    Filename = "errors.log"
    Format = "XLML"
    Header = ""
    Local = "1"
    Translate = "0"
------------
Oh, by the way, any one who needs certain dynamic content features
unsupported in Xitami might want to take a look at sambar server.
I can here you breathing easier already.

Message-ID: <20060917133047.IAVK24218.ibm58aec.bellsouth.net@ronscomputer>

Reason I ask is that I have a Win2003 server set up with Apache and have
decided I don't like Apache so I'm going back to Xitami and I want to make
sure it runs as a service. Sometimes the server farm updates the server and
reboots it. If I don't have Xitami running as a server it doesn't start
until I log in.

That was covered  back in 2004.
Here is a copy. of the instructions that should work with any version that
contains the required files.

From: Steve Winn
Subject: RE: [Xitami] Installing Xitami as a service

The older version 2.4d9 that had the installer was a lot simpler to figure
out, but the newer open source versions are just as easy once you figure out
what to do (guess that's true with anything heh).

1. Unzip the xitami archive to c:\xitami 2. In the \xitami\win32 folder,
copy the xicpl32.cpl to your
\windows\system32 directory.
Copy xisrv32.exe to the \xitami directory.
3. Goto a command prompt, type "cd\xitami" to change to the xitami
directory. Then type "xisrv32.exe -i" to install the service. The service is
now installed.

To uninstall the service you can run "xisrv32.exe -u".

The service will automatically start when you reboot, or go into services
and start it manually, or open the xitami control panel and start it there.

If you are going to be accessing folders or files over the network, you may
need to go into services and tell the xitami service to logon with an
account that has access.

Steve

That's what I like about Xitami, it hasn't changed a lot  in the last 
few years & most questions have been answered  & are in the archives. ;-)

Hi Ron,

as Alex wrote already in his post, you ONLY need to call xisrv.exe in a
DOS box like in the description inside of the xitami dir with xiserv.exe
-i which installs the service. After that you can configure the service
from the controll panel. Can't desribe it, as I don't have 2003.
That's really all what you have to do to run it as a service.
The xicpl32 is only for the icon to showup in the controll panel. Not
needed to run the service.

Johannes

Johannes,

Thanks I got it running fine and got the Apache service disabled. Might run
Apache on a different port or I might turn on IIS on a different port. It's
nice to have 3 to choose from but since I grew up with Xitami I feel more

Hi Ron,

as Alex wrote already in his post, you ONLY need to call xisrv.exe in a DOS
box like in the description inside of the xitami dir with xiserv.exe -i
which installs the service. After that you can configure the service from
the controll panel. Can't desribe it, as I don't have 2003.
That's really all what you have to do to run it as a service.
The xicpl32 is only for the icon to showup in the controll panel. Not needed
to run the service.

Hello Ron,
If you get GD to generate images with XITAMI, please pass on what you have
done to resolve it. I have been trying on and off for the last few months to
no avail, I even installed Apache thinking maybe it was something with
xitami but I am more inclined to believe that GD only runs on a Lenox box.
My test.php page tells me GD is running however it will not generate the
data in the image file.

Johannes,

Thanks I got it running fine and got the Apache service disabled. Might run
Apache on a different port or I might turn on IIS on a different port. It's
nice to have 3 to choose from but since I grew up with Xitami I feel more
confident with it, just wish it had better intrigration with ASP. And I
noticed that Xitami runs faster than Apache for PHP. My pages loaded about
twice as fast. I do have one small problem with my PHP and GD that I need to
resolve.

Hey Ingo,

GD is not a function of Xitami, but rather a function of perl and perl is
only called when the CGI process is activated.  I am using GD for image
altering and image generation.  Here is a function I am using to generate
images out of a font - a method for "guarantying" the user sees the font you
want them to see on your web page.   But alter the code a bit and you can
create images in a variety of ways.

Hope this example helps.  Others could probably code a better version, but
mine is sufficient for what I need.
-Russel

Win 32 Perl v5.8.3 running on Xitami v2.4d9 on Win2K Advanced Server
    - GD Module: v2.30
    - GDTextUtil v0.86
    - Font-TTFMetrics v0.1

sub gdImage {
   ### USAGE CALL
   ### &gdImage("some text",$fontColor1,$fontColor2,$fontType,13) ;
   ###     - I prefine all my fonts, colors, etc in another sub routine that
is called
   ###     - in any script that outputs HTML.

   my $varText = $_[0] ;
   my $varbColor = $_[1] ;
   my $varfColor = $_[2] ;
   my $fontType = $_[3] ;
   my $fontSize = $_[4] ;
   my $fileType = $_[5] ;

   ### Remove spaces & white space
   $varText =~  s/[^\w\s]//g ;

   ### create file name from text
   ### append any character to front for quick font changes
   ###  - to change fonts, edit prepended character and change $fontType
passed to function
   ###  -
   my $fileName = $varText ;
   $fileName =~ s/ /_/g ;
   $fileName = "A_" . $fileName . ".jpg" ;

   ### Check if image file already exists
   ###      - if exist, display image
   ###      - if not exist, create image and store it
   ###
   ###      This method requires a file only be created once
   ###
   if (-e "/xitami/htdocs/images/gifs/$fileName") {
      print qq{<img src="/images/gifs/$fileName" border="0" alt="$varText">}
;
   } else {
      use GD ;
      use Font::TTFMetrics ;

      ### set background color
      ### for easy use, colors are passed in RBG hex code, but passed with
spaces
      ###    - ie: $varbColor = "A5 B4 67"
      my @bColors = split(/ /,$varbColor) ;
         $rb = hex $bColors[0] ;
         $gb = hex $bColors[1] ;
         $bb = hex $bColors[2] ;

      ### set FONT color
      ### for easy use, colors are passed in RBG hex code, but passed with
spaces
      ###    - ie: $varbColor = "A5 B4 67"
      my @fColors = split(/ /,$varfColor) ;
         $rf = hex $fColors[0] ;
         $gf = hex $fColors[1] ;
         $bf = hex $fColors[2] ;

      #### retrieve font info:
      ###   - type,
      ###   - length, retrieving character length is important
      ###       - font length allows you to create image just big enough to
hold all characters
      $fontMetrics = Font::TTFMetrics->new($fontType);
      $fontLength = int($fontMetrics->string_width($varText));
      $fLength = $fontLength * ($fontSize + 2) * 96 / ( 72 * 1024 ) ;

      #### create new image, pad the fontSize with offset of 6
      my $img = GD::Image->new($fLength,$fontSize + 6) ;

      ### set new image properties
      $backColor = $img->colorAllocate($rb,$gb,$bb);
      $fontColor = $img->colorAllocate($rf,$gf,$bf);

      $img->transparent($backColor);
      $img->interlaced('true');

      ### Example of parameters required by stringFT:
      ###       -
gdim->stringFT($color,$fontname,$fontSize,0,$xPixel,$yPixel,$line) ;
      my @bounds =
$img->stringFT($fontColor,$fontType,$fontSize,0,0,0,$varText) ;

      ### Use above dimensions to center text

$img->stringFT($fontColor,$fontType,$fontSize,0,(($fLength-$bounds[2])/2),16
,$varText);

      ### save image.
      open(PICTURE, ">/xitami/htdocs/images/gifs/$fileName") or die "Cannot
Create File" ;
      binmode PICTURE;
      print PICTURE $img->jpeg(100);
      close PICTURE;

      ### print image to html
      print qq{<img src="/images/gifs/$fileName" border="0" alt="$varText">}
;
   }
}

Subject: [Xitami] Load Issues
Message-ID: <BAY105-DAV167D1F357A3B1D412F595CF8220@phx.gbl>

I always enjoy these forums....even after 6 years of use I constantly learn little tid bits that ultimately help me better manage Xitami.  A recent post about PHP and CGI processes made me wonder about a few things.  hopefully some folks here have some insights into these items.

I recently learned that PHP, in Xitami, is actually run as a CGI process....if thats true then I see no benefit in running PHP scripts - what advantage would PHP have over CGI.  Maybe smaller more adaptable HTML coding can be achieved with PHP, but as far as the server is concerned, a PHP script will still generate a CGI process.  Yes/No?

What kind of load issues can Xitami handle?  I run Xitami v2.4d9 on a W2K Adv Server, 2gig of memory on a dual core pentium 3.2ghz processor.  However, I expecting my server to take an immense amount of hits....every link on my site is a perl script.  And nearly every perl script does at least 3 or 4 mysql queries to pull data needed for the html pages.  What if a 1,000 users hit my site at the same time, can Xitami handle it - can the server cpu/memory/xitami handle approx 1000 perl.exe running at the same time?  What about 2,000 or more?  Who has extensive experience with load issues on Xitami that could comment on this, how to deal with these issues and ultimately suggestions on how to optimize windows and xitami to have the best performance?  I only have one domain, bound to an IP address - so not virtual hosting is occuring.

What is going to break first?  

Articles on Xitami:
http://www.serverwatch.com/sreviews/article.php/3116281

I personally love this one, old but I wonder if others can comment on whether or not this 5 year old article is still applies in todays web server market:
http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/soa/Look_out_Apache_and_IIS_here_comes_Xitami/0,139023166,120262449,00.htm

Most interesting in this one is the "CPU Usage" at the bottom: http://www.networkinformation.com/xitami.php

anyone have other comments to add on this subject?

Running PHP has no performance advantage over compiled CGI scripts / 
Perl, that's right. It's up to the interpreter of course but process 
starting overhead should be the same. However, PHP allows easier 
inline scripting, as you have identified.

I haven't been even close to the usage patterns you describe, so I 
can't comment on that...

Thanks Russel,
Your script wont help me much but well appreciated, however I believe that I
will also need GDTextUtil to make it work. I'll grab that and keep on
working with it. Sooner or later I'll get it work.

Hey Ingo,

GD is not a function of Xitami, but rather a function of perl and perl is
only called when the CGI process is activated.  I am using GD for image
altering and image generation.  Here is a function I am using to generate
images out of a font - a method for "guarantying" the user sees the font you
want them to see on your web page.   But alter the code a bit and you can
create images in a variety of ways.

Hope this example helps.  Others could probably code a better version, but
mine is sufficient for what I need.
-Russel

Win 32 Perl v5.8.3 running on Xitami v2.4d9 on Win2K Advanced Server
    - GD Module: v2.30
    - GDTextUtil v0.86
    - Font-TTFMetrics v0.1

sub gdImage {
   ### USAGE CALL
   ### &gdImage("some text",$fontColor1,$fontColor2,$fontType,13) ;
   ###     - I prefine all my fonts, colors, etc in another sub routine that
is called
   ###     - in any script that outputs HTML.

   my $varText = $_[0] ;
   my $varbColor = $_[1] ;
   my $varfColor = $_[2] ;
   my $fontType = $_[3] ;
   my $fontSize = $_[4] ;
   my $fileType = $_[5] ;

   ### Remove spaces & white space
   $varText =~  s/[^\w\s]//g ;

   ### create file name from text
   ### append any character to front for quick font changes
   ###  - to change fonts, edit prepended character and change $fontType
passed to function
   ###  -
   my $fileName = $varText ;
   $fileName =~ s/ /_/g ;
   $fileName = "A_" . $fileName . ".jpg" ;

   ### Check if image file already exists
   ###      - if exist, display image
   ###      - if not exist, create image and store it
   ###
   ###      This method requires a file only be created once
   ###
   if (-e "/xitami/htdocs/images/gifs/$fileName") {
      print qq{<img src="/images/gifs/$fileName" border="0" alt="$varText">}
;
   } else {
      use GD ;
      use Font::TTFMetrics ;

      ### set background color
      ### for easy use, colors are passed in RBG hex code, but passed with
spaces
      ###    - ie: $varbColor = "A5 B4 67"
      my @bColors = split(/ /,$varbColor) ;
         $rb = hex $bColors[0] ;
         $gb = hex $bColors[1] ;
         $bb = hex $bColors[2] ;

      ### set FONT color
      ### for easy use, colors are passed in RBG hex code, but passed with
spaces
      ###    - ie: $varbColor = "A5 B4 67"
      my @fColors = split(/ /,$varfColor) ;
         $rf = hex $fColors[0] ;
         $gf = hex $fColors[1] ;
         $bf = hex $fColors[2] ;

      #### retrieve font info:
      ###   - type,
      ###   - length, retrieving character length is important
      ###       - font length allows you to create image just big enough to
hold all characters
      $fontMetrics = Font::TTFMetrics->new($fontType);
      $fontLength = int($fontMetrics->string_width($varText));
      $fLength = $fontLength * ($fontSize + 2) * 96 / ( 72 * 1024 ) ;

      #### create new image, pad the fontSize with offset of 6
      my $img = GD::Image->new($fLength,$fontSize + 6) ;

      ### set new image properties
      $backColor = $img->colorAllocate($rb,$gb,$bb);
      $fontColor = $img->colorAllocate($rf,$gf,$bf);

      $img->transparent($backColor);
      $img->interlaced('true');

      ### Example of parameters required by stringFT:
      ###       -
gdim->stringFT($color,$fontname,$fontSize,0,$xPixel,$yPixel,$line) ;
      my @bounds =
$img->stringFT($fontColor,$fontType,$fontSize,0,0,0,$varText) ;

      ### Use above dimensions to center text

$img->stringFT($fontColor,$fontType,$fontSize,0,(($fLength-$bounds[2])/2),16
,$varText);

      ### save image.
      open(PICTURE, ">/xitami/htdocs/images/gifs/$fileName") or die "Cannot
Create File" ;
      binmode PICTURE;
      print PICTURE $img->jpeg(100);
      close PICTURE;

      ### print image to html
      print qq{<img src="/images/gifs/$fileName" border="0" alt="$varText">}
;
   }
}
