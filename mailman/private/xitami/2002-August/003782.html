<PRE>Ok, then, how about someone answers my one question then? How do I 
change admin passwords? I only wanted to e-mail that question to Xitami 
tech support in the first place. I don't need to know anything else 
about Xitami. I need this one and only this one question answered. I'm 
assuming everyone is ignoring it, thinking I haven't read the 
instructions in the FAQ. I have. I've gone over them backwards forwards 
and sideways. I've tried many different ways of interpreting those 
directions. I've tried reinstalling the darn thing. If someone who knows 
what they're doing will answer this simple freaking question, I will be 
forever done with this list. But asking me&quot;did you read the FAQ&quot; or 
repeating that I edit the Xitami.aut file does me absolutely no good. 
Please assume that I have at least half a brain, and that I tried 
everything in the FAQ and on the Xitami help pages BEFORE signing on to 
this list.
Sorry to get touchy, but I'm running out of time, and my job is at the 
moment dependent on this question being answered.
