<PRE>&gt;<i> Is anyone watching this list or monitoring what goes out?
</I>
Ewen reads this list, not in depth every day, but generally reacts
quickly when there is trouble. You note he stepped in when there was
question about announcing another product here. In the past, he has
acted quickly to suspend a member when they had an autoresponder
stuck in infinite loop.

&gt;<i> Today I received three different messages that had headings
</I>&gt;<i> matching questions on the list, but the contents of those messages
</I>&gt;<i> were advertisements.
</I>
Quite odd. I've been on the list continuously for over 2 years, and
can not recall one porno or hair-curl type spam that seemed in any
way connected.

&gt;<i> headings matching questions on the list
</I>
And yet, no spammer would think of subjects like the geeky things we
talk about here. So it does seem like someone is harvesting the list
(and too dumb to hide it); or that your email client is mixing
headers and bodies (I've seen that happen after a message with an
invalid header).

&gt;<i> Someone tell me how to change the admin password so I can
</I>&gt;<i> unsubscribe from this list and get out of your hair.
</I>
Have you tried the methods you were given? Mostly: look in the other
*.aut files for Admin sections.

And it is shockingly easy to move your webpages folder, delete the
whole Xitami directory structure, install a fresh copy, and move
your webpages folder back. I have done that when I thought I'd
mucked-up Xitami.
