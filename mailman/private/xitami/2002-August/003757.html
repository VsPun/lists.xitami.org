<PRE>Question: Is anyone watching this list or monitoring what goes out? 
Today I received three different messages that had headings matching 
questions on the list, but the contents of those messages were 
advertisements. I got one ad from a porn site (gamelink.com), one for 
&quot;curly hair&quot; and one that was just a bunch of gobbledygook that looked 
like an image file that was translated into code. I get enough spam as 
it is, without this list giving my address to more spammers. This is my 
work e-mail, and it's gotten to the point that I get 100 or so spam 
messages a day, and one to four messages that I actually need for my 
job. With the Klem virus thrown into the mix, I'm having to quarantine 
files every three minutes during download - so I can't just tell the 
computer to download the e-mail and do something else. I have to sit 
here and babysit it.

Please. Someone tell me how to change the admin password so I can 
unsubscribe from this list and get out of your hair.

- Greg
