  Hello,

  I've posted a few times, and have even had replies to my posts.  However, 
I can't find a link that will let me come to the list, and reply to the 
posts.  I don't get them in my email inbox either.  I would really like to 
participate in the discussions here!  Would someone please send me a link 
&quot;to my email&quot; <A HREF="mailto:jglennqualls@hotmail.com">jglennqualls@hotmail.com</A>, that will let me come read the posts 
in the list, and actually reply to them?  Thank you so much!  As soon as I'm 
able to come and reply to the posts here, I look forward to taking part in 
allot of the discussions.  I would also like very much to respond to the 
replies to my earlier posts, and to thank the users who replied to them!  
Thank you and have a good day!  Once again, please send this to 
<A HREF="mailto:jglennqualls@hotmail.com">jglennqualls@hotmail.com</A>, because I'm having trouble even finding the 
list... I know that must sound stupid, but this is just different to any 
other lists I've seen, which there's only been a few.  Thanks all!

  John
