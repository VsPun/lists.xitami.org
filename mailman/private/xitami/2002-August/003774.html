</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Someone tell me how to change the admin password so I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>unsubscribe from this list and get out of your hair.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Have you tried the methods you were given? Mostly: look in the other
</I>&gt;<i>*.aut files for Admin sections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And it is shockingly easy to move your webpages folder, delete the
</I>&gt;<i>whole Xitami directory structure, install a fresh copy, and move
</I>&gt;<i>your webpages folder back. I have done that when I thought I'd
</I>&gt;<i>mucked-up Xitami.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I've tried following the instructions in the FAQ for both changing the 
admin password and for making a new account. Neither seem to work. I 
already have a valid password for myself, but in order to view the CGI 
I've been working on, my boss has installed Xitami and I've been trying 
to help HIM get a valid password set up. In the FAQ it mentions that 
during install you can make a username and password, but he says that 
the option never came up. I wouldn't really need him to get his own 
password, except that because I was still learning CGI when I started 
working on our current project, all my CGI files are stored in 
C:/Xitami/cgi-src instead of cgi-bin, so I need him to change the 
default CGI directory in his settings to be able to view them. I would 
re-program the cgi files to look for cgi-bin, except that there are a 
prohibitively large number of files in our project, and I'll already 
have to go through them all once and change that when the project is 
finished and we put it online.

So maybe I'm misinterpreting what the FAQ is telling me to do. As far as 
I can tell, I need to edit the xitami.aut file so that where it 
currently says &quot;Admin=-&quot; it changes to &quot;Admin=mypassword.&quot; Is there a 
step somewhere I'm missing? Is there an alternate way to change it? Even 
after changing it and restarting the program (even restarting the 
computer) Xitami will not accept my password with the username &quot;Admin.&quot; 
Of course, on my computer I have admin access anyway with a different 
name, but I need to get my employer's computer to accept a password.
