<PRE>Well depending on what you need you may have better luck with a 
older more mature version of Xitami.  I tried one of the 2.5 versions but 
was having to many problems on the OS/2 platform using CGI so I 
switched back to 2.4d until things clear up (and then I'll enjoy of the 
nice new features of 2.5 :).  I am currently running 5 Xitami servers on 
separate IPs currently.

For windows NT 4.0 I am running 2 Xitami servers for some Windows 
ONLY web apps I wanted. 2.4d9 NT service seems very stable and has 
so far (crosses fingers) been running with little intervention.

My track record with 3 OS/2 servers running Xitami as my primary web 
servers.  Running up to Xitami 2.4 with no problems for years on the 
OS/2 servers.  My systems are two Pentium 100s and a 133 are rarely 
over %5 CPU utilization on a full upstream pipe.  OS/2 is my preferred 
platform for Xitami.  I have had some servers run for over a year and 
never even need so much as a reboot.  The perfect load and &quot;no 
worries&quot; web combo in my experience.  

I hope I can keep using OS/2-Xitami as my primary servers.  Who 
knows maybe in the future m$ will make things proprietary enough 
you'll need a licenced copy of windows just to use the net. :P
