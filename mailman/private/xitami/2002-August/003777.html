As others have noted, I haven't seen spam messages on the list; and I've
just checked my spam folder to see if any Xitami list messages have
turned up there (no).

When considering this, beware that the Klez virus picks &quot;random&quot; subject
lines and to/from addresses that it finds on: someone's hard drive, the
web, etc.  The Xitami list is archived on the web, so it's entirely
possible that it may have been found and used as a source of subject
lines.  (I've definitely had mail where the subject lines has been taken
from the Xitami documentation on the web.)

I suspect that some spammers have also started emulating the same
technique.

One thing that you can do to determine where the messages are most
likely to be coming from is do &quot;view all headers&quot; and look at the
&quot;Received&quot; lines to see which machines the mail has been through.

Messages that have been through the Xitami mailing list will mention
&quot;sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net&quot; (the mailing list server machine) near the 
middle of the list of &quot;Received&quot; lines (about half to get to the mailing
list server, and half to get out to you).

If the messages in question do not mention sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net
then they definitely didn't come from the mailing list, but are instead
someone &quot;imitating&quot; the look of the mailing list messages to try to get
past spam filters.

(If someone does want to filter on this, I'd suggest not filtering
on that exact machine, because it's possible it could change at some
point in the future.  But &quot;imatix.net&quot; should always be somewhere in
the Received headers.)
