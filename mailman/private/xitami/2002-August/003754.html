<PRE>I was just notified that ColdFusion MX (CF MX) no longer has a file called
'cfml.exe' anywhere in the distribution.  This is a disasterous
announcement since Macromedia (the company that bought out/merged with
Allaire Corp.) has not opened the interface to ColdFusion MX.  I was
seriously considering opening XiFusion's source after a couple more
updates, but this notice was unexpected and untimely.

Here is what I am going to do to resolve this issue:

1)  Contact Macromedia and try to work with their developers to get
XiFusion to work with CF MX.
2)  If they will work with me, I will probably have to sign a
non-disclosure agreement.  This will effectively make XiFusion closed
source indefinitely.
3)  If I have to maintain XiFusion as closed source, I will port XiFusion
to every platform under the sun that CF MX and Xitami works under (as long
as I can get access to the hardware and software needed to compile and test
the programs).

There is a good chance that Macromedia will not support my efforts.  Those
of you considering a purchase of ColdFusion MX should weigh these issues
and take a serious look at Shining Light Productions' Nuclear Vision as a
viable alternative.

In the event that MM will not cooperate with me, I will just develop
XiFusion to the point that I was previously planning to develop it and at
that point decide if open sourcing it is a good idea.  In such an event,
XiFusion will work with CF 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0, but not CF MX.

As I told the person who notified me of this issue:
Cross your fingers, toes, wish me luck, and hope for the best...

Hope this helps!
