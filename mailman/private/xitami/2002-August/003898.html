<PRE>Thanks for your detailed emails.

&gt;<i> Xitami generally sets PATH_TRANSLATED to a workable value
</I>&gt;<i> before calling the script.
</I>OK, so I don't think that's happened/happening correctly.
But, let's back-up a bit first. This is what I've done so
far (in the order I did it):

Installed ActivePerl_5.6.1 in c:\perl
Installed Xitami in c:\archivos de programa\xitami

(One of the main problems I am trying to deal with is that I have
recently emigrated to Spain and so the OS is in Spanish; I only
understand English. Also, Win2000 is completely new to me anyway,
having upgraded from Win95).

In Xitami, I defined the following:
Main HTML directory = c:/website
Main CGI directory = c:/website/cgi-bin
CGI URLs start with = /cgi-bin
.pl extension MIME-type = text/html.
I haven't made any other changes to Xitami.

I have successfully tested this script...

#!/perl
print &quot;Content-type: text/html\n\n&quot;;
print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;

However, this works whatever shebang I use, even if I purposely
write a totally incorrect one. I don't know if this is a good or a bad
thing (?). Also, I don't know if the above shebang is correct?

Next I tried to install my message board script. I have successfully
done this before on my domain-host's server.
I am using a variation of Matt's wwwboard script, revamped as
'Talkshop', from www.spiceisle.com/talkshop

There is an Administration/set-up script which
unpacks the rest of the package after confirming some directory paths
using an HTML interface.
However, I don't get as far as being able to define directories or
unpack the scripts. The Admin script tells me that &quot;The value for the
PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable [c:/website] is incorrect. Please
enter the correct value below&quot;.
I've tried entering many different directory paths, but all are
rejected, and I get the same message each time.
Having read about fifty pages on the Internet about PATH_TRANSLATED,
I am none the wiser about how to set it, or what it should be! All the
reading material is Sys Admin stuff, and way over my head.

Thanks again for your help.
