On which note, spammers have recently (within the last six months)
started putting the characters &quot;[]&quot; into their subject lines (usually
with nothing inside the brackets).  The current theory as to WHY they've
started doing this is that the spammers had become aware that a lot of
&quot;potential recipients&quot; were using their usernames only for mailing list
traffic, and that they had suitable mail disposal filters defined such
that traffic with &quot;[somelist]&quot; in the subject line was automatically
routed to a &quot;somelist&quot; folder.  Spammers not wishing to have their
traffic ignored started putting in the brackets to work around such
filters.  (Happily, since they mostly have the null string inside the
brackets, this itself makes a fine filtering rule :-)

    &quot;We have gone from a world of concentrated knowledge and wisdom to one of
    distributed ignorance.  And we know and understand less while being incr-
    easingly capable.&quot;              Prof. Peter Cochrane, formerly of BT Labs
