<PRE>Oh get over it, you are complaining about the stuff the geeks from 20 years
ago complained about. Come to the present folks. Look I hate having to go to
the bottom of the email to read the response. I prefer the reply to be at
the top, if I want to read the original email I will scroll down to do it
but most of the time I already know what is in the original email. And all
those &gt;&gt; drive me crazy. They muddy everything up and makes it hard to
figure out who has what comment. Netiquette, is that you answer an email
like you answer a letter. If you are forwarding a letter to someone you
don't doctor the original up with &gt;&gt;&gt; or anything else. I will give you the
removal of the extra stuff on the bottom, but frankly I rarely get that far
so it doesn't bother me.

Which is as it should be; however, neither you nor the other posters to
the thread bothered to trim off material that was not pertinent to the
answer.  Top posting is particularly singled out for opprobium precisely
because it leads to shoddy thinking and failure to trim trailing
material; it is that lack of trimmin that really upsets people.

(Not helped by Outlook Express's usual mode of quoting; OEquotefix ought
to be deployed by everyone.)
