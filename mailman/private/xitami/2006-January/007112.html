<PRE>I sent this message to Quercus REXX support.
I want to use REXX to write cgi-bin programs for my Web server.
The XITAMI Web server that I am using provides two input/output options.
1. The cgi-bin program (REXX routine) can read directly from the stdin
device (or alternately from DOSENV variables), and write directly to the
stdout device.
2. The cgi-bin program (REXX routine) can read input from a temporary file
named pipe0001.cgi (or alternately from DOSENV variables), and write output
to a temporary file named pipe0001.cgo.
For several reasons, I would prefer using the second option.

My first and most severe problem is that my XITAMI Web server aborts after
issuing an Assertion Failure message whenever I try to use the pipe0001.cgi
and pipe0002.cgo temporary files in my REXX program. I've run traces that
have shown that the REXX program has run to completion after reading from
pipe0001.cgi and creating pipe0001.cgo.

I've asked for help from XITAMI and the XITAMI user's forum on this problem,
but so far, everyone seems to be baffled.

Up until I installed the updated REXX files that you sent to me yesterday, I
was able to successfully use the first option by running REXX.exe instead of
PREXXW.exe. After I installed the REXX updates that you sent to me
yesterday, the first option no longer works. Now the REXX.exe output is
written to the REXX console window instead of to stdout so the XITAMI Web
server can no longer send the output back across the Internet to the client
that submitted the form.

When I switch back to the older copy of REXX, once again I can read input
from ENVIRONMENT variables using DOSENV, and write output (my HTML Web page)
to stdout.

Questions:
* Do you have any suggestions that might help me make option 2 work?
* Is there anyway I can force PREXXW.exe to read from the stdin stream and
write to the stdout stream instead of to the REXX console window?
* What changes were made to REXX.exe in the update that causes it to write
to the REXX console window instead of to stdout?
I will really appreciate any light you can shed on this problem.

Thank you!
