<PRE>So do you mean that 

- either your CGI either goes directly and reboots the PC if on Win, and
  Xitami is killed/can start up auto after reboot,

- or the perl CGI would say something like:

  exec( halting_and_starting_executable() );

  and the exec'ed process would not self-destroy after Xitami halt
  when Xitami kills all executing CGI's because an exec'ed process is
not 
  a process dependent on the lifespan of the launcher of itself?

If and as long as you run two processes there is no problem.

1) Your CGI application to execute a call to an application in your
server machine
2) The Application which is invoked by the CGI.

The CGI is only to send some parameters to the main Application to
indicate what you want it to do.

A proper set of rules for this would be as follows

   Halt server
   Start Server
   Reboot PC

The fourth optional parameter I am toying with now since I keep having
problems keeping Xitami alive 
since FTP keep hanging up with nasty C errors is a checker that can lay
dormant in the background 
and run a check every 30 seconds to ensure that Xitami is actually up
and running.

The reboot PC I made into a CGI to force a full system flush at a set
time every night.
If I miss to log in and run it, It will run itself by the Scheduler to
force a flush of the system.

Since Xitami can be set to run on boot up, this is not a problem either.

Further more, if your config is ok, and you execute a cgi to reset your
machine, you can just as
well do this from the cgi if you have another app restarting it again.

I dont see any problems whatsoever with this and in fact wrote my
solutions in VB 5 to keep it simple fast and practical.

	This all seems  a bit too complicated for a simple process.
	
	The problem with killing and restarting the service via cgi (and
I think php) is that when you kill the server you will also kill the
process that is executing the kill/restart commands.  The kill command
will work and will stop the service, but now that the service is stopped
the cgi will be terminated which means the second part of the the perl
process, &quot;restart&quot;, won't get executed simply because the CGI process
has already been terminated.
	
	I know this is a fact for the CGI process but I am not certain
about the PHP.  CGI is a engine that runs and execute web based perl
scripts.  However I think the beauty of PHP is that there is no engine
managing php scripts, which means if a php script is run via a url, that
the php script will load into memory and execute even if the webserver
is killed in the middle of being executed. Someone might be able to
elaborate on the PHP process but I think thats how PHP works.
	
	Someone else suggested use the &quot;server refresh&quot; feature in the
defaults.cfg but this means its an automated thing and doesn't give you
the ability to do it remotely, quickly, etc.  when ever you want.  You
need another way of executing a perl/php script remotely that isn't done
via the URL, or via the same webserver.  Maybe run a second web service
on a different port that simply manages the kill/restart of the first
service.

		Hello,
		
		There are lots of different &quot;kill&quot; tools out there. Most
of them can be set to different &quot;brutality&quot; levels. First they try to
stop the running task by sending a kind of &quot;Alt-F4&quot; command. When the
task is still running properly it will react by closing all open files
and terminate the regular way. After this, when no reaction, the running
.exe can be really &quot;killed&quot; and can be kicked out of memory.
		
		I'm running a scheduled task that is testing the Xitami
server every minute by a simple http-Get, and if there is no answer
probably Xitami was shot by unknown reason (maybe my own PHP scripts do
so by fault). This happens 2-3 times a day to me. After a defect is
recognized, Xitami becomes killed and restarted in the way I mentioned.
I never found problems when doing so. No problems with open files, even
when PHP scrips are called.

		&gt;Yes but is it safe to kill Xitami just like that
whenever you feel like
		&gt;it? Runing CGIs, open files and all..
		&gt;
		&gt;Ayhan
		&gt;
		&gt;try to download Windows Command line Tool &quot;kill.exe&quot;
		&gt;Then try to put two Shell Commands by PHP:
		&gt;
		&gt;shell(&quot;kill xiwin32.exe&quot;);
		&gt;shell(&quot;xiwin32.exe&quot;);
		&gt;
		&gt;- or something like this.
		&gt;
		&gt;First line kills all active tasks of Xitami, the second
line starts new
		&gt;Xitami.
		&gt;Refer to the manual of the kill.exe tool.
