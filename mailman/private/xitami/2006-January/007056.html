<PRE>Hi
Thanks for such a speedy responce, i don't want to sound dumb, but can i have that in english again, the dns is ok i think thats configured and works ok because don't laugh &quot;i can ping ip address or name&quot; now i'm lost, is there any chance you can send me a llist of instructions i'm good at following instructions, i know a fair bit about xitami and should be able to do most things once pointed into the right direction.

Regards
michael

</I>Assuming that you have the appropriate wildcard CNAME in the DNS for
your domain so that all addresses point to the same place then this
should be as simple as writing a (perl) script to copy a blank virtual
host directory to the one for the name and edit defaults.cfg to add
the new vhost.

In other words it should be trivial with the hardest bit being
controlling who is allowed to create the subdomain and to ensure that
only valid and sensible names are used (at least I assume your client
would prefer it if obscene subdomains were not allowed for example)
