<PRE>That does appear to be exactly what is happening.  Is there a way to fix
this?

The only ports you should need to open are 80 and if you use the FTP 21. It
could also be that your public IP is different from that provided to you 
by your provider.

Say for instance you are issued a dynamic IP 19.19.19.1 and you have this 
assigned to your router/firewall.
In fact your ISP may assign you a this only for their internal use, and run 
you through a gateway of say 19.19.18.254
So instead you show up as surfing from this gateway IP.

Go to DNSSTUFF.COM and verify your public IP address is in fact the one 
your DynIP is getting.
It will show up in the top right hand corner of the screen what you are 
actually on.
This would be the first thing I'd check and believe it or not, but it does 
even happen on ranges which are issued static IP's too on SDSL.
