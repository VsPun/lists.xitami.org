<PRE>Hello,

Xitami is set up on a LAN to test WEB Page Creation. All is working great on the LAN and the WEB Pages set up in each PCs hosts file displays as expectd.

The router was then set to pass incomming messages to the IP and the Port where Xitami is installed. This works great from PCs outside this LAN to access these test WEB Pages given the correct http:// string to key-in at those PCs browsers.

However, there is a concern related to these test WEB Pages being accessed from the Internet that they could be found by a WEB Crawler before they are ready for release. Because of this, the Router had this option turned off.

As a result the following two questions arose:

    1. Is it possible for WEB Crawlers on the net to eventually 
       get a hit on the thios Router IP and find these TEST WEB Pages?

    2. If so, then is it possible to make Xitami ignore these Crawler requests?

No luck to find this in the Xitami Email Archives. I thought I had seen a recent comment related to Xitami and Crawlers but I could not find it.

Thanks for your time, advise, and help!!!

Jerry
