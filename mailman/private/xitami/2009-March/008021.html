<PRE>the list is still here - just not very busy nowadays.

ver 5 was just released and the website has been updated - but it's still 
the initial beta release. there is also a &quot;developer&quot; list if you would like 
to join that one to stay up to date with the development of ver 5...

Subject: [Xitami] Am I doing something wrong?


&gt;<i>I was signed up for this list a few years ago and recall it being
</I>&gt;<i> relatively active.  I'm still using an old version of Xitami for better
</I>&gt;<i> or worse -- mostly better as far as I can tell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I saw that a new version has been released and thought it would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good time to re-subscribe to the list but it's been a couple of weeks
</I>&gt;<i> and all I've received was the initial acknowledgment email telling me
</I>&gt;<i> that I have successfully subscribed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my question is:  is the list dead or am I mis-configured somehow and
</I>&gt;<i> just not receiving it?  I'm really interested in hearing what folks may
</I>&gt;<i> have to say about version 5.  I'd love to be able to get it working
</I>&gt;<i> under Ubuntu but I've never had any luck compiling the software for
</I>&gt;<i> myself.  The system I do have working was pre-compiled and part of the
</I>&gt;<i> basic installation under a-linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>       Mike
