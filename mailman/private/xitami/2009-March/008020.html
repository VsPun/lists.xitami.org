This list is not dead, it's just asleep!  :-)

You should be able to build X5, and it does run (it's running the
legacy.xitami.com site right now, and seems to be pretty stable, just
serving static HTML pages).

Why not try building and let us know what happens.  I'll walk you
through any problems you hit.
