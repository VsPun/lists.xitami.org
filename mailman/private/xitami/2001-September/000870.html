<PRE>&gt;<i> you get a pager and add a relay and have that trip the reset. this is cheap and effective from anywhere.
</I>
Mmmm.... I'm too old to know how pagers work. They are cheap, I know.
&quot;Sick&quot; answering machines are cheaper (it only has to clunk, not play a
tape properly!) but then I have to mess with phone wires.

Thanks for the idea. It may be real useful. 

&gt;<i> does VNC support netmasks so I can limit access to 6 or 8 LANs 
</I>
The unix version can be made to, the Windows version does it this way:

..options ... can be set in the system registry...

 The AuthHosts setting is, unlike the other settings, a REG_SZ string.
It is used to specify a set of IP address templates which incoming
connections must match in order to be accepted. By default, the template
is empty and connections from all hosts are accepted. The template is of
the form:  
              +[ip-address-template] 
              ?[ip-address-template] 
              -[ip-address-template] 

 In the above, [ip-address-template] represents the leftmost bytes of
the desired stringified IP-address. For example, +158.97 would match
both 158.97.12.10 and 158.97.14.2. Multiple match terms may be
specified, delimited by the &quot;:&quot; character. Terms appearing later in the
template take precedence over earlier ones. e.g. -:+158.97: would filter
out all incoming connections except those beginning with 158.97. Terms
beginning with the &quot;?&quot; character are treated by default as indicating
hosts from whom connections must be accepted at the server side via a
dialog box. The QuerySetting option determines the precise behaviour of
the three AuthHosts options.
