<PRE>&gt;<i> I can't begin to imagine what the people of new york are going through right now.  
</I>
Off-topic, but I know many of us are shaken by this atrocity. 

I work 40 miles southwest of NYC. A co-worker here just sent this mass
email, which I think is worth sharing: 

 =========================
 Hello to All,

I wanted to let you all know that I am fine, as are all of my colleagues
and friends, here at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ.  This
catastrophe is mind-numbing and unbelievable, but through it all I still
see the hand of God working His miracles.  My friend Eric's girlfriend
and my friend Andrew's wife were working downtown, but managed to be
just outside of the real danger.  My friend and colleague Mark's
father-in-law actually works (worked) in the Trade Center towers, and
was on his way to stepping on the subway to the Trade Center, when the
first explosion happened.  The train just _happened_ to be late
yesterday morning (!). His partner was in the first building (52nd
floor) and managed to escape.  All but one of their employees are found.
Maya's mom works in the Trade Center, but she is on vacation to London. 
Many of my professors and friends live in New York, and all of them are
fine.  My friend Michael works at Merrill Lynch in NJ, and he has lost
many colleagues.

I consider myself blessed and lucky that this tragedy did not affect me
personally, but at the same time, I grieve for those who have lost
someone, and pray for our country which will be forever changed. 

I think back to the time when Joel and Jason came to visit and we were
driving all around the World Trade Towers, talking about the 1993
bombing.  Now when I drive up the turnpike, there is just smoke all
around.  

So, we are shaken but okay.  I will be praying through this tragedy, and
I wish you all peace.

 Sincerely, 
 Linda
