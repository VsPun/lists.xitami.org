</I>
If you've got a repeatable bug (and it sounds like you do), then the
main thing to do is to try to gather as much information about the
circumstances it occurs in as possible.  In particular turning on the
Xitami server debugging support ([Server] debug=1) and trying again
should give you more detail on the command(s) the user's FTP program is
sending at the time that Xitami crashes.  It certainly sounds like it's
choking on one of the commands being sent for some reason.

The next thing I'd usually try is network traffic snooping, which is
easy under Linux/Unix (tcpdump, ethereal, snoop, etc), but off hand I
can't think go a way to do it under OS/2.  This gives you a
packet-by-packet view of the data that Xitami is sending and receiving,
which can help narrow down the troublesome cause further.

&gt;<i>I'm running v2.4d6 on OS/2. I have a CORE file but have no idea how to 
</I>&gt;<i>glean anything from it.
</I>
If you have the EMX development tools installed, you can try:

gdb xitami.exe core

And then &quot;bt&quot; (back trace) to try to find out which routine Xitami was
running when it crashed.  This may or may not be as useful as the
information from the debug log, depending on what type of bug it is (eg,
some bugs corrupt things which only cause crashes later on, so what you
want to know is where it was corrupted not where it finally crashed
because of the corruption).
