<PRE>Hi,

This is not really a Xitami specific question, but if someone could help, i
would be very gratefull.
I've set up 2 Virtual hosts on my machine, and had no problem locally. I can
accede all of my websites, from my machine. (BTW Win NT, Xitami, MySql).
The problem is, now i want to set up an intranet with all of my hosts
visible. But i can only see 1 site from other machines - my default
site===my machine name.
Some descriptions that may help you:
1) I've configured the hosts on the hosts file under system32\drivers\etc
locally. I've tried to do it on the Main Server. nothing happened.
2) I've tried to configure my lan card to have multiple IP numbers. had some
difficulties (i have some doubts i did it right...), but no luck again.

Can somebody bring some light of how to solve this problem?
Thanx in advance,
Rui
