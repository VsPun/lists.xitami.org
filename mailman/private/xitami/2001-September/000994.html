There sure is. Still 2.4d7 though, I didn't see a reason to upgrade,
because that was mostly because of the reserved names in Win9x if I
remember correctly.

May I take the opportunity to praise Xitami; it's really funny to
see how code red tries to infect it. The log files *do* become a
little longish, though. Also the traffic has increased quite
noticeably because of the infection attempts, which will show on the
next month's ISP bill. (Apparently you don't need to be actually
vulnerable these days to be victimized, it's sufficient if enough
other web servers are.)


&gt;<i> Xitami/Pro source on FreeBSD.  In theory it shouldn't be too tricky,
</I>&gt;<i> a Xitami/Pro is basically the Xitami source, plus some code to interface

</I>&gt;<i> freely available, but the Xitami/Pro extensions have traditionally been
</I>&gt;<i> a commercial product, hence fewer people have compiled Xitami/Pro.
</I>
I doubt Xitami/Pro will be any problem at all to compile, unless
e.g. there are 3rd party libraries used that don't exist on FreeBSD.
OpenSSL does exist on FreeBSD; SSLeay I don't know about, but I
assume it's there too, or at least a good imitation thereof.


&gt;<i> If you're still keen mail me off the list (ie, directly to
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="mailto:ewen@imatix.com">ewen@imatix.com</A>) and I'll bring the issue up with someone at iMatix HQ.
</I>
Me being the FreeBSD port maintainer of Xitami, please feel free to
contact me if you think I might be of any assistance.
You might also consider to ask on the FreeBSD mailing lists; for
general questions try <A HREF="mailto:questions@freebsd.org">questions@freebsd.org</A>, and for port-specific
stuff <A HREF="mailto:ports@freebsd.org.">ports@freebsd.org.</A>
