Ah, that's possibly installed a webserver as part of its test environment.

&gt;<i>[netstat -na shows]
</I>&gt;<i>TCP        0.0.0.0:21       0.0.0.0       heard
</I>&gt;<i>TCP        0.0.0.0:25       0.0.0.0       heard
</I>&gt;<i>TCP        0.0.0.0:80       0.0.0.0       heard
</I>
The :80 one is the important one; it's the webserver port (by common
convention).  So you've definitely got _something_ which is running as a
webserver.  (And also a FTP server, and also a mail server.)

I believe there are some third party programs which can tell you for a
given network port, or file, which programs have it open, but off hand I
don't know of any of them.  (Under linux/unix there is &quot;lsof&quot; (list open
files) which does this; I'm pretty sure there's a Windows equivilent.)

Failing that, there's two possiblities: 
1.  Looking in the list of running services and applications (in the
    task manager) for likely suspects, and try to figure out which one
    it is.  Anything &quot;information server&quot; or &quot;web server&quot; like is a
    possibility.  You could try stopping the likely suspects one at a
    time until you figure out which one it is takes away the &quot;:80&quot;
    reference in netstat -na.

2.  You could try connecting to the webserver, with, eg, telnet and see
    if it'll tell you anything about itself.  Eg:

    telnet 127.0.0.1 80

    GET / HTTP/1.0

    (and press return twice)  Often there'll be some sort of Server:
    line that identifies it, and you might be able to match this up with
    some program running on your system.

&gt;&gt;<i>All Xitami's ports can be shifted with the portbase option: eg 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&quot;xitami -b 5000&quot; will move all the ports up by 5000, giving 5080 for HTTP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>By cmd W2K i couldn´t execute &quot;xitami -b 5000&quot; because there isn´t
</I>&gt;<i>xitami.exe and if i have done with Xiwin32.exe -b 5000
</I>
Yup, that was what I meant.  (The name of xitami varies depending on
which build you have (console, gui window version, NT service, etc), but
we usually just say &quot;xitami&quot; when we suggest running it.)

Unfortunately it seems that version of Xitami doesn't check for command
line paramters.  In which case you'll need to create a defaults.cfg file
(if you don't already have one; add this to the end if you do) which
says:

[server]
  portbase=5000

For the builds that support it the &quot;-b&quot; paramter does the same thing for
a single run.
