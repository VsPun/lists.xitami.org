<PRE>Ewen,

Well,  after a bit of deliberation,  and after some quick trials and tests,
it certainly does appear that .....

Simply changing the  applicable references  in the   'httpdir.gsl'   file
from   &quot;nameurl&quot;   to  &quot;name&quot;   does the trick on my system.
The directory lists, and all of  the file downloads now function as
typically expected.  A file named as &quot;qwerty.exe&quot; downloads or runs under
that same name,  and any other file(name) performs or downloads as that same
file(name).  No more double extensions or redundant/different extensions.

Thanks for that terrific tip and pointer.

Regards,
	Wally..

The extra extension tends to happen if you already have the file
downloaded to that directory; at least one common webbrowser handles this
situation by appending &quot;(1)&quot; to the filename.

The double extension issue is more puzzling; IIRC this used to happen
with Xitami 2.5b5 (it may still happen there), due to an extremely
conservative test for which characters don't need to be escaped in the
filename, resulting in the filename being escaped, and another extension
added by the webbrowser.  (If you think this is hitting you, in 2.5b5, try
substituting &quot;name&quot; for &quot;nameurl&quot; in httpdir.gsl and restarting.)

Off hand I can't think of anything in Xitami 2.4d9 which would cause
this effect, except possibly if the same code that causes the 2.5b5
effect is also in 2.4d9.

Does anyone else see this extension doubling in 2.4d9?
