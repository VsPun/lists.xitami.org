<PRE>I just went through this and finally got mine to work..  Here is what I did
and think might work for you.

When using the VHost wizard you need to define the following fields as such:

Create virtual host profile:      hostx.cfg (.cfg is assumed)
Select IP address:                  All Addresses (recommended)
Or, enter DNS host name:    www.yourdomain.com
Web Page Root Directory:    /Xitami/hostx/webpages
CGI-bin directory:                /Ximati/hostx/cgi-bin
FTP root directory:              /Ximati/hostx/ftproot
Create directories if necessary?  Checked

Whats important in the above example is that you make soft references to the
directory path using forward &quot;/&quot; slashes.  I tried using windows default
back &quot;\&quot; slashes and had problems.  I also made a hard reference using
&quot;c:\PATH&quot; and had problems too.  It seems Xitami even treats its configs and
Path references like URLs using the forward &quot;/&quot; slash.  I choose to do the
above configs because that allowed me to contain all files and
sub-directories within a single root directory.  Others have choosen to
create the /Xitami/hostx/webpages for their html docs but then did
/Xitami/cgi-bin to contain ALL CGI files for all domains in a single
directory.  For myself I like a little bit more organization.  However, some
of my domains do share the same CGI files (most of my databasing needs all
rely on the same database utilizing seperate tables from the same DB, the
reason I did this is because I designed a Perl DB that allows me to create
tables, queries, entry forms, etc on the fly)  In order to share the same DB
across multiple domains (but make it look like each domain has a separate
DB) I created a VHost domain simply to host the DB and nothing else.  Then
when DomainX needs certain DB functions I will pass URL (most likely from a
FRAME subset) from DomainX to DomainDB.  This process can be repeated across
multiple domains allowing me to manage only one DB.  Security is not the
greatest but is managed through a series of checks and balances using Cookie
s.

Anyway, I got off on a tanget.  Xitami only creates the directories.  It
doesn't place any &quot;index.htm&quot; or &quot;default.htm&quot; files in the directories just
created for &quot;hostx&quot;.  You shouldn't have to make any references any where
else, as long as your FORWARD (A records) DNS is working correctly for that
VHost then all should work OK.  The only PTR DNS (reverse) record for the
Xitami server should be for the main domain on that server.  In my case, if
someone accesses my server via the IP address then a default page (managed
by the cgi files of DomainDB) is displayed simply showing links to all the
domains hosted on that server.

I intend on using my server as a training device, once I get everything
completed people will be able to access my site and look at config files,
domain references and mainly the DB I created.

Hope some of this helps.

&gt;<i> Hi Alvaro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> first you have one too many w's in www there and while i dont know your
</I>dns
&gt;<i> setup you either need dynamic dns for the main domain or you need a record
</I>&gt;<i> for each sub ...www.yourdomain.com is a sub of yourdomain.com
