<PRE>Hi Ewen,
By your tip i have found the Ghost and Zombie that lives in background and
makes the life difficult for Xitami.
The Ghost is called IIS you was right.
I couldn´t belive it because i didn´t installed it direct.
It was installed by Visual Studio.net package by clicking on OK and with it
i have installed IIS server and some other server option.
Bevor starting of Xitami it have to be cloesd or ended by
administration/service/www-publishing service/task end.
There are other possibility to do it but generally you can end this
background process via administration/services
The status of IIS Autostart can change via setup.

Now a new problem:
The file host ( without extension) with following contents i have copied
into WINNT and system32 directories(i did it for win95 as well).
127.0.0.1 localhost

127.0.0.1 www.jf.com

127.0.0.1 www.far.com

but i cann´t access to these pages.

Every time if i access to one of above pages that i heve defined them as
Virtual Hosts, modem switchs on and Xitami is going to access to the page
via modem( via ISP) but by access to localhost or 127.0.0.1 does it direct
without is activated modem.

I use OS W2K.

Can you help me again.

Best regards,

Joubin

</I>&gt;<i> Ah, that's possibly installed a webserver as part of its test environment.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;[netstat -na shows]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TCP        0.0.0.0:21       0.0.0.0       heard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TCP        0.0.0.0:25       0.0.0.0       heard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TCP        0.0.0.0:80       0.0.0.0       heard
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The :80 one is the important one; it's the webserver port (by common
</I>&gt;<i> convention).  So you've definitely got _something_ which is running as a
</I>&gt;<i> webserver.  (And also a FTP server, and also a mail server.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there are some third party programs which can tell you for a
</I>&gt;<i> given network port, or file, which programs have it open, but off hand I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know of any of them.  (Under linux/unix there is &quot;lsof&quot; (list open
</I>&gt;<i> files) which does this; I'm pretty sure there's a Windows equivilent.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Failing that, there's two possiblities:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Looking in the list of running services and applications (in the
</I>&gt;<i>     task manager) for likely suspects, and try to figure out which one
</I>&gt;<i>     it is.  Anything &quot;information server&quot; or &quot;web server&quot; like is a
</I>&gt;<i>     possibility.  You could try stopping the likely suspects one at a
</I>&gt;<i>     time until you figure out which one it is takes away the &quot;:80&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     reference in netstat -na.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  You could try connecting to the webserver, with, eg, telnet and see
</I>&gt;<i>     if it'll tell you anything about itself.  Eg:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     telnet 127.0.0.1 80
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     GET / HTTP/1.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (and press return twice)  Often there'll be some sort of Server:
</I>&gt;<i>     line that identifies it, and you might be able to match this up with
</I>&gt;<i>     some program running on your system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;All Xitami's ports can be shifted with the portbase option: eg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&quot;xitami -b 5000&quot; will move all the ports up by 5000, giving 5080 for
</I>HTTP
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;By cmd W2K i couldn´t execute &quot;xitami -b 5000&quot; because there isn´t
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;xitami.exe and if i have done with Xiwin32.exe -b 5000
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, that was what I meant.  (The name of xitami varies depending on
</I>&gt;<i> which build you have (console, gui window version, NT service, etc), but
</I>&gt;<i> we usually just say &quot;xitami&quot; when we suggest running it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately it seems that version of Xitami doesn't check for command
</I>&gt;<i> line paramters.  In which case you'll need to create a defaults.cfg file
</I>&gt;<i> (if you don't already have one; add this to the end if you do) which
</I>&gt;<i> says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [server]
</I>&gt;<i>   portbase=5000
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the builds that support it the &quot;-b&quot; paramter does the same thing for
</I>&gt;<i> a single run.
