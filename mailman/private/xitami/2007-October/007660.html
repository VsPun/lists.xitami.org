<PRE>Good info, thanks.

For more specifics:
Server: HP DL380 G2, Dual Processor, 6Gb RAM, 6 146Gb RAID-5 drives, SCSI 
1Gb controller
OS: Windows 2003 Enterprise Server (32Bit) with /pae boot.ini option 
(extended memory from 4Gb to 6Gb)
Applications: DNS, Mail, MySql, Web

MySql maxes at 3.5Gb (what I have read).  I have set mysql max_connections 
at 1000 (for now) and optimized the cache(s) at 250Mb.  MySql is configured 
for MYISAM dbs.  Xitami &gt; Perl &gt; MySql will be the most intensive 
applications.  I ultimately will be moving Web/Perl, DNS, and Mail off of 
the above server as I expand.  However, until I expand, the 
Xitami/Perl/Mysql trio is my biggest concern when it comes to optimization.

Perl only gets executed as a result of cgi-bin files in Xitami.  And I 
believe I have tweaked MySql as best as I can get it (for now) so my biggest 
concern was configuring Xitami/Windows so that Xitami and OS wouldn't be a 
bottle neck.  I know soooo many people have said on many many occassions not 
to use Xitami for production.  But for the many years I have run I have 
NEVER had a problem with it and its been very trustworthy, fast and 
reliable.  I suspect though that my latest website is going to test all 
previous limits but I still want to give Xitami the chance it deserves as my 
production webserver.

Is it best to let Windows determine its own virtual memory or should I just 
set it 10Gb?  And I wish there was a way to completely dedicate, within 
Windows, physical ram to specific apps.

Thanks

&gt;<i> &gt;  is there anyway to provde the application more memory so that if it
</I>&gt;<i> needs it, it is available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not Mac OS/6. Any 32-bit Win-app can request 2GB at any time. The
</I>&gt;<i> whole point of virtual memory is that the app does not know if the 2GB
</I>&gt;<i> is DRAM or hard drive or small angels with clay tablets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've run Xitami and CGI in 8MB (obviously not Win2003). If a runaway
</I>&gt;<i> script asks for 6MB, so the total system demand is 12MB in 8MB RAM, the
</I>&gt;<i> request is satisfied though the system gets slow. The fix is to be sure
</I>&gt;<i> you always have that 5MB (or whatever) to spare.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use Task Manager. &quot;PF Usage&quot; should flutter far below the Physical
</I>&gt;<i> Memory number. Launching a CGI interpreter will spike it; VB6 runtime
</I>&gt;<i> loads over 1MB of junk into RAM, but gives it back when it exits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My Xitami on Win2003 box is idling at 173MB total. Xitami is 5th on the
</I>&gt;<i> process list with about 5MB used. Launching a small Perl script barely
</I>&gt;<i> registers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Task Manager also shows CPU Usage. When code is not waiting on disk or
</I>&gt;<i> I/O, this always spikes to 100%, but if it spikes and falls in a blink
</I>&gt;<i> then you are not really limited by CPU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  with 6Gb of memory
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think Xitami has more than enough memory. Also VB, Perl, PHP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The biggest slow down of the server is watching cgi-bin scripts kick 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What interpreter, and how heavy are the scripts? Even back in 133MHz
</I>&gt;<i> 128MB RAM days, we could get away with quite sloppy code. One of my
</I>&gt;<i> scripts opens and reads several text files, twice, because it was less
</I>&gt;<i> programmer work than doing it once and the result was plenty fast.
</I>&gt;<i> Another one must skim every file in a folder to get type and summary
</I>&gt;<i> info, and it runs in a blink. If you are opening gigabyte databases, you
</I>&gt;<i> probably don't want the script doing that, you want a persistent
</I>&gt;<i> database server application which is already primed when the CGI asks
</I>&gt;<i> for data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apache has a way to keep PHP running all the time so you don't suffer a
</I>&gt;<i> PHP interpreter load on every hit. But that only helps if you have a LOT
</I>&gt;<i> of hits on scripts so easy that interpreter load-time exceeds script
</I>&gt;<i> runtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interpreted scripts can sometimes be compiled, and run somewhat faster,
</I>&gt;<i> if they are not disk-bound.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short: you need to know what's really taking time, and what resource
</I>&gt;<i> it is bound in. And with 6GB, it seems unlikely that RAM-cram or memory
</I>&gt;<i> allocation is the problem.
