<PRE>I didn't even know what a backslash was until I got my first computer in
198x something or other. We know things change thoughout the years and here
is what my friends who work for Microsoft say.

&quot;\&quot; is a backslash
&quot;/&quot; is a whack

So something like this http:// would be http:whackwhack and this c:\ would
be c:backslash

Compute on

It most decidedly NOT a &quot;backslash&quot;.  Back in the 1960s, when I too used
to use IBJOB control cards and the like, the character was generally just
called &quot;slash&quot;.  Purists might call it &quot;oblique&quot; or &quot;solidus&quot;.  NO ONE
EVER called it a &quot;backslash&quot; in that era.

&gt;<i>                            It deals with the motion one makes with a pen
</I>or
&gt;<i> pencil as opposed to direction of incline.  For those who remember cards,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;backslash,backslash&quot; defined a command card in IBM Job Control Language
</I>&gt;<i> (JCL).
</I>
A  novel etymology: would you like to air such ludicrous views in a place
densely populated with very erudite &quot;old farts&quot;; I mean, of course, the
newsgroup &lt;news:alt.folklore.computers&gt;.

Moreover, the punched card code had no means of generating what is
correctly called a backslash.  The character is simply a &quot;slash&quot;.

&gt;<i> &quot;\&quot; - this is the forward slash.  Again, describing a physical motion.
</I>
That character was never seen until the second (or was it the third?)
revision of ANSI X3.64 (aka ASCII) in the mid-to-late-1960s.  As soon as
it appeared, some people started calling it a &quot;backslash&quot;, because it was
the mirror image of the familiar &quot;slash&quot; character aforementioned.  Other
names are &quot;reverse slash&quot; or &quot;reverse solidus&quot;.

&gt;<i> be gentle,
</I>
Why?  If you spout arrant nonsense, you must expect to be ridiculed and
royally flamed.   There are already far too many &quot;intellectually
challenged&quot; Windoze lusers around who don't understand the correct
nomenclature, and like you, have it arse-backwards.  Don't add to their
paucity of knowledge by reinforcing a contradiction.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't the term &quot;software program&quot; dedundant?
</I>
I would agree with this viewpoint: however, I fail to see where the term
might have been used in the post which you quoted.
