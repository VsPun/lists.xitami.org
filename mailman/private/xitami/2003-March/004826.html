 &gt; Same basic response though, why re-invent the wheel? While OT it 
surprises me
 &gt; how many people overlook set and ready command line tools.

I don't have &quot;tail&quot; on my computer, and writing a small utility that can do 
the job is much easier to me than search for that program on the internet.
And i can modify my program to show the requests highlighted, and split the 
200-, 300-, 400-, and 500 (not that i have much of this last) responses in 
different colors.



 &gt; (And no, before anyone criticises my remarks as being those of a Unix
 &gt; &quot;fanatic&quot;, I don't use it: I use OS/2, and have for many years used Unix
 &gt; tools ported to that environment. Last time I really used Unix would
 &gt; have been ca.1982, using V7 on a PDP-11/60:-)

(And no, before anyone criticises my remarks as being those of a Windows
&quot;fanatic&quot;, I ... heuh ... yes, use it, and have for many years used Windows
applications ported to that environment. Last time i used Unix would have
been ca.1993....)
