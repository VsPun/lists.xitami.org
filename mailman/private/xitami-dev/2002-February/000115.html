Not really, no.  People keep coming along and wanting to pay us money to
do things.  How can we refuse?  :-)

&gt;<i>I writing a article for Circuit Cellar Online about State Machine and I 
</I>&gt;<i>wanted to mention OpenKerenel, Xitami, Liberao, et. al. but saying &quot;it is 
</I>&gt;<i>impossible to build from the current cvs&quot; doesn't seem like a good thing, so 
</I>&gt;<i>will probably just not mention them at all.
</I>
Libero in particular is basically stable; the version on the iMatix
website is essentially the same as in CVS, and builds fine with just a
compiler.  Please mention it in the stuff about state machines; it's a
very useful tool.  (Indeed libero was what first attracted me to
iMatix.)

SFL can be built from CVS.  The rest of Open Kernel _can_ be built from
the combination of CVS and what is on the website (someone challenged me
to do it, and I proved it could still be done: the major trick is that
you have to build two versions of SFL (one from the website and one from
CVS), and two versions of GSL (again the one on the website and the one
in CVS) to get through the process.  Once you've done it once, you've
got all the right tools, and it's fine).

&gt;<i>There needs to be some kind of boot strapping procedure when you are starting 
</I>&gt;<i>off on a clean system (no tools other than the basics like GCC et.al.).
</I>
Indeed.  Alas so many things depend on GSL now (including SMT), and the
current version of GSL depends on SMT.  So building from scratch
directly from CVS is currently a little tricky.

When ready-to-compile packages are generated for the website obviously
they'll include all the generated files, which neatly side steps this
problem.

However the circular build dependencies are causing problems internally
too, so they are definitely being worked on as time permits.
