Subject: [Xitami-Dev] How to build Xitami on Linux?
Message-ID: <200803081220.46450.bob.paddock@gmail.com>


I downloaded the Linux version of Xitami from the site, but
when it goes to build it calls a script called 'c'.

This message says that I'd find 'c' in the base/boom package,
but I did not:
http://lists.xitami.org/pipermail/xitami/2006-May/007311.html

Trying to build the base package fails saying it can't find
gsl3.

How do I build on Linux today?

What happened was that the 'c' script got migrated into a different
package and removed from the Xitami tree by a zealous admin.

I was meaning to fix this in 2001 or so but got distracted with other
business... :-/.

Download the foreign package from http://download.imatix.com/pub/, the
'c' script is there.

Thank you.  I got it build and installed.  I had to change a couple
of header files to get it to build on my AMD64, was there
someplace I should have done configure different?  I did not
find it.  Maybe some day you can port the OpenAMQ
build scripts to build Xitami.  They seem to detect the AMD64
ok, etc.

I understand the distraction problem, paying stuff has
to come first.  I've wanted to learn more about your
tools for a long time myself.  I'm always
writing some type of state-machine or other
for the "impossible" code I do.

When you do feel in a fixing mood,
http://imatix.net/pub does not have MOP
pointed by http://download.imatix.com/mop/ .

http://www.imatix.com/index.html does not exist,
and the FAQ does not exist http://www.imatix.com/html/xitami/index13.htm .
Maybe you could redirect dead pages to the new Wiki?
http://legacy.imatix.com/html/xitami/ works.

Maybe you should run a link checker sometime.
