Unfortunately ;) my workpals don't want to change their mind and coding
scheme. Biggest difficulty for them to keep in mind to unroll the long loops
(I understand that this is uncomfortable) and to establish inter-process
data exchange to execute a simple sql query while it is really simple in eg.
Windows C++. This is mostly the problem. OTOH, inter-process communication
in a server means more fd (in case of a portable solution) for the entry
process. LB dns could be a solution but then it is not enough to buy procs
but at least net cards and IP addresses too. Never mind, just thoughts.

solutions in Java on Call Center or CRM fields with some inspiration from
another Java based solution. Then, I mentioned this SMT strategy. That's
all. We are now on M$ with C++ because of the small-medium target sector and
promotion opportunities...

</I>.. And yes, I made this part of the development on C++ class and native win
thread base with Libero code generation. Because of the above reasons, no
SFL and SMT used. This is actually a framework and others code applications
with further tools for web forms and DB handling.

I would be very happy to tell more about this framework and improvments but
you know.. it's not only my business.. :(

Laszlo

PS: I believe this FSM approach must become an industry standard to develop
trustable, stable software. Object oriented solutions are good in design but
lock and race conditions can mess them up. However, FSM is still a kind of
object but always know where it is and what should come next. /Me/ ;)
