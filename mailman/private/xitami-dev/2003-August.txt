Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Xitami does not pass PUT request to LRWP
Message-ID: <9307C9319CD71A499EDDA4739F4C80C8010D6A@olxchg.okhtor.net>

 Hello all.

 I need to have an LRWP application receive PUT requests
 from an http client that access the LRWP served URI in
 a Xitami web server.

 Xitami only passes the GET and POST requests.

 I have modified smthttpl.c and smthttp.c on a 2.5b5 release
 to treat HTTP_METHOD_PUT as HTTP_METHOD_POST.

 It works, but is not a very elegant solution, in that I loose
 the standard behavior of the HTTP PUT method. Also, I will
 want to use XitamiPro as a front end, so my solution would
 not be feasible here.

 Well, my beloved Xitami Development Group, could we have
 something like a parameter in the [Lrwp] stanza of the
 xitami.cfg that permits an LRWP application to also
 handle PUT requests?

 Very kind regards.
