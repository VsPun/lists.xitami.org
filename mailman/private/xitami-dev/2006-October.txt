Hi

Do not know which version you are running. Running the latest version (beta c1) seemed to have fixed that issue at least in my computer.

Thanks Gopal! I am running the Xitami v2.5c2 version. Is the version you has
BUGS ?
Which version are you using? Please clarify me on this ! One of the reason I
am suspecting such crashes is in relation with Norton AntiVirus runnning on
the systems, got this in some where in the mailing lists on Net.

Waiting for your reply!

Thanks,
Vishal Kumar

Xitami is full of several bugs, but I have never seen an error message
like the one you described.

Perhaps try running the latest release... I think it's 2.5c6.  It may have
a fix for the problem you described.

Just a thought.

Hi Vishal

I am running the 2.5c0, which does not seem to have this problem.

Try other versions and see how it goes.

Worst case, try the other free webservers such as apache.

Vishal,

I currently run version 2.5c0 at my workplace and also locally on my 
laptop and have never seen the error you have described.
Over the years, I have had some infrequent crashes when using Xitami, 
but generally have found it to be fairly reliable.

You do not mention if you have tried to re-install Xitami, it might be 
worthwhile to get a fresh copy and re-install as this may eliminate the 
possibility of damaged files.

I have run Xitami with Norton's Internet Security, but (from memory as 
it was a while ago) apart from having to let the Nortons know it was OK 
to  let Xitami run, I had no problems. Maybe check the firewall settings.

With Kind Regards,
     David Embrey

Ok so I downloaded the unix source to my linux environment.  I ran:

sh ./build.sh

an I get all kinds of errors.  The main one being that

c: command not found

Do I need to do something here?

Thanks,
Joe

Vishal,

I currently run version 2.5c0 at my workplace and also locally on my 
laptop and have never seen the error you have described.
Over the years, I have had some infrequent crashes when using Xitami, 
but generally have found it to be fairly reliable.

You do not mention if you have tried to re-install Xitami, it might be 
worthwhile to get a fresh copy and re-install as this may eliminate the 
possibility of damaged files.

I have run Xitami with Norton's Internet Security, but (from memory as 
it was a while ago) apart from having to let the Nortons know it was OK 
to  let Xitami run, I had no problems. Maybe check the firewall settings.

With Kind Regards,
     David Embrey
