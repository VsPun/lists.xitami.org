Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Anybody share gslgen4.exe (or gslgen3.exe) with me?
Message-ID: <9a77767b0807101038u680f8067o1ea452e503ce876f@mail.gmail.com>

*(If you think this thread is off topic, please ignore it and I say sorry to
you.)

*I downloaded source code from IMatrix.com, and built it.
But it seemed we need a c script file to build the code.
I grab the file from koder.com, it still doesn't work.

Could you please tell me how to build gslgen or share it with me?

Thank you,
