Have you tried the current 2.4d9 or 2.5b5 builds?  Not that I expect any
major differences, but it'd be useful to know if those fail too as we've
got the source for both carefully issolated so we know what is in them.

</I>
Okay.  In what way does Xitami fail to work?  Does the service not
register?  Or does it not start?  Are there any log messages.  If the
patch is a &quot;registry security&quot; one I could see how registering the
service might run into problems, but not how some of the other things
could fail, especially given the console mode still works.

More information/experimentation welcomed.
