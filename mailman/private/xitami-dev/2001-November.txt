The list still works, but it's very very quiet.  xitami@lists.xitami.org
(hosted on the same server -- the user list) is moderately active still.

I'm still rushing around desperately trying to catch up with all the
things I'm supposed to be doing -- and it looks like another week or two
before I get vaguely caught up.

I have a requirement to use LRWP from a 16 bit CGI program to Xitami
under Windows 98.

The program is currently running as CGI from Xitami Pro and I want to
reduce the load time and file open requirements to provide improved
performance.  It is 16bit written in MicroFocus Cobol as a Windows 3.x
executable.  I can incorporate MSC (MSVC 1.52) compiled code into the
program, but will this work and has it been done ?

If you listen and act on the right  ports, there should not be any problem.

I don't use 16 bit ( as I said, it does not matter), but instead choose to 
create and use
a library that allows me to write code in Delphi Object Pascal. And it 
works very well
with lightning fast performance. It should work in 16 bit if you can parse 
the input and
output properly.
