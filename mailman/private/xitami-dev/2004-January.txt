Are old message from this list archived anywhere? I'd like to avoid

Ok I'm new to this list, so don't jump on me if this is the wrong place to
post.  But...

critical bug with Xitami 2.5c1

After saving the configuration from the web based admin, restarting the
web server craps out.  It appears to not read the xitami.cfg file properly
on restart (but only if you previously clicked SAVE on the web based
admin).

The error occurs around when reading the "webpages=" and "cgi-bin="
parameters.  It looks like arbitrary data from elsewhere in the xitami.cfg
is being read in for those parameters, and when the webpages= does not
match a valid path, the program terminates.  The exact point in the file
where it reads the bogus data is not always consistent.  From my last run,
these are the results reported in the log files:  (note that it was
restarted from WBA @ 11:37)

As you can see, the pointer jumped to a random spot in the xitami.cfg file
where the MIME types were defined when Xitami was trying to read the
webpages and cgi-bin settings.


Also maybe related, some settings on the web based admin do not actually
update the defaults.cfg file.  Most notably the IP addresses to which
Xitami should bind (this setting usually used for customizing multi-homed
servers).  The only way to set that is to manually edit the defaults.cfg
file.  There may be other items in the web based admit that also don't
work.


Finally, my apologies if this was the wrong place to post.  Please forward
this email to the appropriate people if such is the case.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Compiling with VC 6.0
Message-ID: <40114EE0.3080709@journyx.com>

I downloaded the Xitami source package, and I'm having problems 
compiling. Besides any environment/configuration issues I might be 
having, there was an actual compile error that makes me think that the 
source package is not the one used to compile all of the binaries that 
are available for download.

Compiling...
smthttpl.c
C:\xitami src\smt\smthttpl.c(1646) : error C2143: syntax error : missing 
';' before '||'
C:\xitami src\smt\smthttpl.c(1646) : error C2059: syntax error : ')'
C:\xitami src\smt\smthttpl.c(1648) : error C2181: illegal else without 
matching if
Error executing cl.exe.

I can edit the source and figure out how to fix that line, but I'm still 
worried that the rest of the code isn't going to have all of the latest 
updates and features. Does anyone know where I can get the source used 
to build the binaries that are available for download?

Also, when I run build.bat, I get a lot of messages like this:

C:\xitami src>build
Building application...
'c' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable 
program or batch file.
boomake: "call c -q -g sflbits" failed

I'm sure it's due to a simple config issue, but googling "call c visual 
studio" doesn't yield many useful results.

Kareem,

C is actually a batchfile that should be included with the package. It
probably isn't present in the directory you're working from.

Pieter Hintjens from iMatix sent me thing, regarding the compilation 
problem:

We fixed that syntax error and rebuilt the packages but somehow the
online archive did not get updated.  It's still a bit more manual
than it should be.

It's a small syntax error and the code should read thus:

         case HTTP_RESPONSE_OK:
             if (p_http-> transaction == TRANSACTION_CGI
             ||  p_http-> transaction == TRANSACTION_WSX
             ||  p_http-> transaction == TRANSACTION_FILTER)
                 put_dynamic_headers (p_http, header);
             else

Is there a public CVS for Xitami? If so, where is it? Googling for it 
didn't turn up any results.
