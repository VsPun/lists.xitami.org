Good questions.  Let me answer each of them.

&gt;<i>  When will cvs.imatix.com be available again?.
</I>
Not for a while.  We have decided that CVS was not a good way to 
deliver the Xitami source code, taking too much effort to build.  We 
will provide source kits as zip/tgz files.  At a later stage we may 
decide to make daily snapshots of the development CVS.

&gt;<i>  How fresh is the New Zeeland site, and why have
</I>&gt;<i>  the building files disappear?.
</I>
The iMatix NZ site will be absorbed into the imatix.com site.

&gt;<i>  How stable is SMT v 3.0 ( smtsock ) for building
</I>&gt;<i>  a production service?.
</I>
It is stable and we are using it for production services.

&gt;<i>  How is the near future regarding SFL &amp; SMT distribution?.
</I>
We are in the process of repackaging all our source code.  iMatix.com 
will have news once we are ready to go public.  Basically we will 
have packages for:

 - base tools (SFL, SMT, GSL, htmlpp, etc.)
 - Xitami 2.4 (including archaic SFL &amp; SMT)
 - Xitami 2.5 (including archaic SFL &amp; SMT)

plus Xitami 3.0 once that starts to become stable.

&gt;<i>  Are there plans to extend the SFL library for XML functionality, like
</I>&gt;<i>  search and sort?.
</I>
Yes, we have planned to make such extensions to sflxml.  However, I 
can't tell you when.

&gt;<i>  How can I pay you a beer for your good work?.
</I>
Come to Brussels and visit us.  We are always happy to share a beer.
