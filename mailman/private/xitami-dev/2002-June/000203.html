<PRE>Hi there,

I am just about to re-write a C++ version of the LRWP C library (out of 
frustration), capable of supporting multithreaded operations (under Windows 
for now).

Before re-inventing the wheel, I'd like to know if someone has already done 
this? A quick Google search came out with nothing on the subject.

IMHO, the fact that the current implementation of the LRWP C lib is bound to 
SFL (which requires single threading) is a mistake. While SFL makes perfect 
sense in the context of the architecture of Xitami, LRWP as a protocol 
should be designed with applications in mind and therefore should be 
agnostic to threading issues. This limitation is probably what has been 
holding LRWP back from being more popular (compared to FastCGI for 
instance).

Don't get me wrong. I *love* Xitami and how it is put together.

Regards,
Fabien.
