Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Mailing list moved to new machine
Message-ID: <20030310210126.489E7ADFD0@basilica.la.naos.co.nz>

For those of you that don't follow the Xitami mailing list as well: the
machine at iMatix which handles these mailing lists has been upgraded
(by moving everything to new hardware).  This includes copying the
mailing lists across to the new computer.

I believe everything is working fine, but if anyone notices any new
issues with the mailing lists please let me know directly
(<ewen@imatix.com>).

Thanks,

Ewen

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] PHP for Xitami
Message-ID: <82C59AF5AF49B347A26D80FCA71DD1AD027F26@dfwex19>

I'm currently experimenting with PHP and Xitami on Windows XP.  However,
running PHP as a CGI is kinda a burden on the box.  Is there a way to have
PHP embedded like PHP does in apache?

Thanks!

Neither PHP or a rather ugly VisualBasic app ever gave my P-166 box
any real problem. Sure it works hard but only for a second.

Be sure your script isn't doing more work than it needs to. Embedded
PHP avoids forking a new PHP compiler on every call, but won't help
much if the script is complex or doing a lot of busy-work.

No. Why not just use Apache? The price is the same, the main
features are there (if deeply hidden in that conf file), and more
development has been done on it. My Apache experiment is forgotten
because it just sits there and does its job perfectly. I do like
Xitami but I hit a buggy script that seemed to prefer Apache and it
was trivial to add Apache on the same box as Xitami and RealServer.

Are you running Apache 1.3.27 or 2.0.42 ?
