in PHP the cookie has to be set before ANY html is sent to page.
e.g. the very first thing in document is the cookie.

The trickest thing here will be having access to TCP/IP networking from
the 16-bit program, as much of the Windows WinSock is only 32-bit IIRC.

(Basically LRWP works as a simple TCP/IP protocol which passes over the
CGI environment for the request, and waits for the CGI result to be
passed back.)

I'm not aware of anyone who has tried to do what you're suggesting, but
providing you can find a way to make TCP/IP networking calls from your
code (or from some sort of interface to your code) it should work.

The source to Xitami is written in C, and it makes use of some libraries
that iMatix developed, as well as state machines using a program called
"libero" that iMatix developed.  You can download all the bits you need
from http://www.xitami.com/ for the source, and http://www.imatix.com/
for some of the extra tools.

>how can i modyfy it ? what do i need on a nt-box ? 

You'll need a C compiler (plus the bits you can download).  Microsoft
Visual C is the one we tend to use, and I think there are even some MSVC
projects for building Xitami in the latest source release.  Other C
compilers will _probably_ work but haven't been tested as much, so there
might be minor issues.  (If you do find any of these issues, please let
us know.)

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] memtrace file clogging system up?
Message-ID: <17122790551.20011212141645@gzo.dk>

Hi xitami-dev

A couble of time have I tried to get my Xitami installation
drive filled totally up by a file called
memtrace.[something] I cant remember the extension, since i
had to remove the file in order to get anyting to work. It
seems to be some kind of debugging info or something...

Anyone know about this?

Yeah, memtrace.lst is written when the server stops without freeing up
all the memory it allocates -- as a debugging aid.

Usually the file should be pretty small (10KB or so at worst); if you
get an "infinite" length file (ie, bigger than 1-2MB), then chances are
the memory has become corrupted for some reason, so that the list of
"allocated memory blocks" goes around in a loop, and the file repeats
the same information over and over again.  This is a bug too, but
perhaps not the best way to tell you about it :-)
