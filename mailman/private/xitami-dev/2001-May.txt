I hope not, because the Xitami product is so easy to set up on both Windows
and Unix.  

I fire it up on my laptop every few days since I'm frequently on LANs for
which I have no login account, and I can easily start up FTP or HTTP and put
or get data from other computers on the LAN.

Xitami - don't leave your homepage without it.

Hi Folks,

Contrary to popular speculation Xitami is not dead; it's just sleeping :-)

As some of you may have noticed by now, we've moved the Xitami-Dev
mailing list to a new mailing list server hosted at iMatix (at
lists.xitami.org).  This is being hosted by Mailman, which provides a
web interface for adjusting your preferences at:

http://lists.xitami.org./mailman/listinfo/xitami-dev

All users who were on the Xitami-Dev mailing list that was hosted by
EC-Computers.Net (run by Scott Drake) have been subscribed to the new
mailing list, and the old EC-computers.net addresses have been forwarded 
to the new lists.xitami.org addresses.  We've also tried to preserve
people's preferences for "digest" or "non-digest" mode where possible;
if anyone wants to change to digest mode or back to non-digest mode,
visit the webpage above, get it to email you your password, and then you
can customise the way your mail is sent.  If you have any problems get
in touch with me directly.

A great big thanks to Scott Drake (of EC-Computers.Net) for running the
Xitami-Dev mailing list (and several others) for us for so long.

The Xitami mailing list will be moving over to lists.xitami.org early
next week, once we're sure we've ironed out any problems with the mailing
list setup on lists.xitami.org

Ewen

PS: Yes we do have the xitami.org domain; time permitting we hope to put
    some more information about Xitami development up there.  But please
    don't hold your breath just yet, we've all got long "to do" lists.
