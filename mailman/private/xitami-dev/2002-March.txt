It is possible, because I made a site for my dad that searches a mysql
database with a PHP search

When you do it, make sure that the defaults.cfg has paths in the form of
/xitami/webpages, or however you system is configured

I have seen programs that did exactly that in the past.  They where on
the 
now defunct winfiles site.  Might be able to find them on ZDNET now.
They compiled your site in to a single exec file with seach.

Hello Lok,
You can run xitami from a single 3.1/2 diskette too.
the only problem it is with the "writing programs" the logs and the
the cgi pipes. but you can configure this to work in the temp
directory on hard drive , if you want acomplishes the things a little
more you can make a memory "virtual drive"
so you do not write anything to hard disk.

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Sharing xitami configuration files in a LAN environment
Message-ID: <3C88E0E7.D5CC5323@mail.telepac.pt>

In our school the network configuration has changed and now we need to
install different copies of xitami in different computers but sharing
the users database file in a centralized one.  I am not sure if it is
the access file I cannot reach or the path declared in users file. I am
running it under windows NT as system service

The parameters I have changed so far are the following:
in xitami.cfg

user-file=d:\ftp_users\ftpusers.aut (where d: is the network drive)

ftpusers.aut
Root=d:\users\UserName

Any hints? Did anyone ever face a similar problem?

Thanks for all the help you can provide me

When changing config files, use defaults.cfg, not xitami.cfg

Good luck

Message-ID: <200203181438.PAA16469@sxpublic.nxrda.imatix.net>

hi,

what is the proposed error-response for xitami and LRWP 2.0 ?

as far as i understand Ewens implementation the implementation
returns a buffer with 1024 bytes length starting with
"REJECTED+delimiter" following the errormessage and i have to
check, if there is a second delimitier after the message itself.

it no delimiter was found i can fetch another 1024 byte block.

can i rely on 1024 byte sized buffers ?

bernd

Anti-Copy Bill Slams Coders
By Declan McCullagh

WASHINGTON -- America's programmers, engineers and sundry bit-heads have not 
yet figured out how much a new copyright bill will affect their livelihood. 

When they do, watch for an angry Million Geek March to storm Capitol Hill.

A bill introduced this week by Sen. Fritz Hollings (D-South Carolina) would 
roil the electronics industry by forcibly embedding copy protection into all 
digital devices, from MP3 players to cell phones, fax machines, digital 
cameras and personal computers.

[The way that the clueless politicians have written the law, even your simple 
digital wrist watch needs to have this copy protection code...]

{The Digital Millennium Copy Protection Act as already been keeping people 
from disclosing bugs found in things like the Linux kernel. ?:-( }
