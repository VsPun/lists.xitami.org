Ok, http://www.xitami.com has absolutely no contact information email.
Please forward this to the appropriate location.


Greetings!

I have discovered a number of bugs in Xitami 2.5c2, some of them a 
nuisance and some of them critical.
As I have written a guide to help other Xitami users get around (or at 
least understand) some of these, please see the guide at 
http://cyberpimp.pimpdomain.com/usr/administrator/projects/Xitami%202.5c2%20report/ 
for descriptions of bugs and quirks.

Two of the bugs are web encoding issues.  (Specifically, URL-encoding 
and HTML-encoding.)  There is another guide on HTML and URL encoding, 
originally intended for PHP developers but applicable to almost any type 
of internet programming.  You might find this helpful for properly 
solving the encoding issues.  It can be found at 
http://cyberpimp.pimpdomain.com/usr/administrator/projects/web%20encoding%20tech%20note/

Holy shit!
Xitami 2.5 is ridden with even more problems than I first thought!

http://cyberpimp.pimpdomain.com/usr/administrator/projects/Xitami%202.5c2%20report/

The web-based admin is a complete total utter mess.  IMO, that entire 
module should be re-written from scratch.
The lack of HTML-encoding, and screwed up URL-encoding for directory 
lists is just plain BAD!
A couple of file I/O and memory management issues too.
And weird oddness as to how configuration data is read and managed.
Plus lack of documentation of all these quirks in the official release docs.

Personally, I'm sticking to version 2.4 until this is cleaned up.  
(though v2.4 also has a few URL and HTML encoding issues, and a little 
tiny problem with the web-based admin)

Hallo Justin,

I'd been wondering now for a long time how I can get a Windows-based web 
server working on an Xitami basis. Until now I've been working with the 
wide-spread Apache which to my opinion is a bit oversized for 
Windows-based web server. What I need is an means to get PHP and 
MySQL-databases working under Xitami. could you please give me some links? 
Those from the Xitami-homepage don't help me much.

Thanx

K-R Schmalhorst

Installing PHP under Xitami is quite easy.
You have to install it as a CGI...  There's no plug-in module that can 
be linked to Xitami.
Personally, my suggestion is to install PHP to a directory which is NOT 
accessible by the general public via the web server.  (ie. a directory 
which is not in the HTTP directory tree).
After installing it, edit PHP.INI (it will be located in the Windows 
directory) so that the cgi.force_redirect option = 0.  (this is safe now 
since PHP.EXE can not be accessed from the web)
Then in the Filters section of the Xitami configuration, create a filter 
for all files with a .PHP extension.  For the "filter command or script" 
part, enter the full path and filename where you installed PHP.EXE.

I still haven't tackled the MySQL yet, so I can't help you there.

Good luck!

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] XitamiUp
Message-ID: <20041220183954.7DB161C109AE@sxpublic.imatix.net>

I am looking for some volunteers to test a program that starts up xitami
if a xitami crashes.
The reason for that i run Xitami and was away from the server for a few
days on several occasions and noticed that Xitami 2.5c2 crashes once in a
while.
So i made a little program that checks if Xitami is running every 5 sec.

Here is the URL to download the program

Thank you!
