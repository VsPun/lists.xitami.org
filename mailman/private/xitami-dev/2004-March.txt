I'm not too familiar with Windows 2000, but judging from what the error 
log indicates, I'd suggest maybe checking your network settings.  
Specifically, ensure the TCP/IP protocol is installed correctly and 
bound to the network adapter (ie Network Interface Card) which you are 
using for your web server.

Also maybe check that no other daemons are bound to port 80 and 81.  (ie 
Microsoft IIS)

Laszlo,

Looks to me like sockets aren't running at all. Check your network
setups.

Hello,
 
Downloaded the UNIX source installation, untared the file, ran build.sh and could not get the source s\to build.  It like the build.sh script is not ready for primetime...
 
This was with 2.4d10.  We currently use 2.4d9 and would like to upgrade...
 
Weve never had these problems in the years we've been using Xitami...
Are there build instructions we dont know about???...
 
Thanks for any help you can give...

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] Big in sfl library - ini_dyn_loade
In-Reply-To: <20040324181819.89953.qmail@web41504.mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <0a5201c41322$9da6b2e0$6909020a@groovinhigh>

Hi,

I've found a bug in the sfl library - sflini.c. The function ini_dyn_loade
(with the e) doesn't release the file handle after a file_locate.

The orginal code is

SYMTAB *
ini_dyn_loade (
    SYMTAB *load_symtab,
    const char *filename)
{
    ASSERT (filename);
    if (file_locate ("PATH", filename, NULL))
        return (ini_dyn_load (load_symtab, filename));
    else
        return (NULL);
}

Fixed this would be

SYMTAB *
ini_dyn_loade (
    SYMTAB *load_symtab,
    const char *filename)
{
    FILE *fp;
    ASSERT (filename);
    if ((fp = file_locate ("PATH", filename, NULL)) != NULL) {
	  file_close(fp);
        return (ini_dyn_load (load_symtab, filename));
    }
    else
        return (NULL);
}

I've checked that this method is not used in the smt libaries (xitami) but
could present problems to other developers.

Cheers

	Angus Lord

Pardon my stupidity, but does this mean Xitami is not affected by this
problem?  (ie Xitami does not use SFL, or it just doesn't use the
ini_dyn_loade function from that library?)

Xitami is based upon SFL, but as far as I can tell doesn't use the
ini_dyn_loade function.
