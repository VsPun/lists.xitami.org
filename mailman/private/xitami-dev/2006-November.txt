I really think you're beating a dead horse here.

Try version 2.5c6.  I doubt there's anything significantly changed that 
it will break something, but it may just have a fix for the bug you are 
experiencing.

If that still doesn't solve the problem, consider changing your 
operating system.

Correction to my previous reply:

Apparently I had an incorrect document from where I got the version 
number.  2.5c2 is the latest version, not 2.5c6.  So I am in fact 
running c2.

Can't say why your system crashes though.
You could always try going back to 2.4d11 if you don't need the 
enhancements of 2.5.

 Try the sysinternals.com tools, process explorer and tcpview to see
 what's going on on your server.

Hi Everyone,

I am seeing the following Error when Xitami is getting crashed, in addition to the previous Error
which i have mentioned earlier.

The instruction at "0x0043ddc0" referenced memory at "0x014b4a8c".The memory could not be "written".
