Subject: [Xitami-Dev] SSL version of xitami 2.5
Message-ID: <935fb99f0908251511i6a7e66a1qcf682a3807a74f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to find the SSL Pro version of Xitami 2.5. I haven't been able
to access the website http://legacy.xitami.org for the last day or so. Has
this site been taken down or what ? Any information would be appreciated.


Thanks
Ram
