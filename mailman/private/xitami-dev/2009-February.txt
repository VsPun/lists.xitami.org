Hi folks,

For early birds who don't mind a worm or two, X5/a0 is now online, in
source form.  The server is still packaged with the OpenAMQ product.
To get it, download OpenAMQ/1.4a3, and build as per instructions.  (It
probably won't build on Windows.)  In the directory base2/http, you'll
find Xitami/5 built and ready to run.

The server is largely self-documenting: "xitami -h" for a summary, or
"xitami --help" for full details.

Questions to this list.

Cheers,
Pieter

Is it really a good thing to be pulling in the Google Analytics stuff,
and wikidot stuff in the default.html webpage of the distribution?

Also default.html is full of invisible white space, slows down load time.

Bob,

Thanks for the report.  I think the test case is bogus and fails
because you have a different timezone setting.  You can simply comment
out that assertion.  Better would be to add 'icl_console_print
(text_string);' before it, so we know what's going wrong...

Cheers,

-Pieter

Subject: [Xitami-Dev] New X5 website, downloads

Hi all,

We've released an X5 binary for Windows, and will have proper source
kits shortly.

Installation on Windows is trivial: pop the .exe onto a directory in
your path, run it.  'xitami -h' gives help.

I redesigned the xitami.wikidot.com website this morning, and it'll
move to www.xitami.com.  If you edit pages, or submit issues, you'll
get emails when someone adds a comment.  This is quite fun.

Sorry for spamming both lists here.  We'll stick to xitami-dev for all
development discussions, so anyone who wants to follow those, make
sure you're registered on xitami-dev.

It'll take a few more hours for the DNS changes to complete.

Cheers!

-Pieter

Hi Pieter.

The executable is missing ;-)

Kind regards, Rafael.
