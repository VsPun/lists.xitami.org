Hello all...Geekster here and I am new to this list! I'd like to salute every dev out there who uses X,  and also thank them for NOT using those dasterdly overpriced MS products(snicker snicker:)
Sorry Server2ooo Devotees~ 
I've used Xserver now, for more than 5yrs, I think; w/o a problem...til recenlty- a glitch I found is if you DUAL-DNS your domains with www and also not using the 'www' for a domain both using the same IP; then use the virtual wizard on those names two names, it screws up! I guess I should try uniques .aut files instead of sharing these. This may not be Xservers fault, but I am just not the saavy 2Bsure- perhaps the fault is with the Nameserver itself. I no longer use a download like DnS2Go/TZO to resolve this IP and never had any luck with granite canyon. I now use ZoneEdit. 

Has anyone experienced this or similar problems using virtual w/o the using multi-homing, ie just using IPs?  "Love" Xitami though! DoeReME.

Hey geekster,

Welcome to the list! I'm running four domains off the same adsl
connection with one IP adress, and I did find that it had to be set up
manually to work properly.

All the best,

I've got six domains one one server, one IP. Virtual host wizard works 
well for me for all the domains and all thier a-records, I rarely have to 
manually edit a config file.  Xitami is by fare the best webserver 
software I've ever come across.

Josh,

Depends on the version. I'm using 2.4d9 because the 2.5bx versions have
ftp troubles from some clients.

Great! Can I check your domains anytime or are you down at certain times?

Okeedohkee, I will check my default and aut files and use yours as a basis for comparison assuming yours all work with one IP and I notice you have some listings here w/o .au. Do you use multiple name resolve for the same address and aut file/virtual host? eg  http://mydomainnamesdot.com
http://www.mydomainnamesdot.com
and http://ww2.maydomainnamesdot.com
  

many thanks!

They're online 24/7.

I don't map ww2 at all, but the other two map to the same site. Yes,
there's a .com in there!
