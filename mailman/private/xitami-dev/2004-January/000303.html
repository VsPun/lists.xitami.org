<PRE>Ok I'm new to this list, so don't jump on me if this is the wrong place to
post.  But...

critical bug with Xitami 2.5c1

After saving the configuration from the web based admin, restarting the
web server craps out.  It appears to not read the xitami.cfg file properly
on restart (but only if you previously clicked SAVE on the web based
admin).

The error occurs around when reading the &quot;webpages=&quot; and &quot;cgi-bin=&quot;
parameters.  It looks like arbitrary data from elsewhere in the xitami.cfg
is being read in for those parameters, and when the webpages= does not
match a valid path, the program terminates.  The exact point in the file
where it reads the bogus data is not always consistent.  From my last run,
these are the results reported in the log files:  (note that it was
restarted from WBA @ 11:37)

As you can see, the pointer jumped to a random spot in the xitami.cfg file
where the MIME types were defined when Xitami was trying to read the
webpages and cgi-bin settings.


Also maybe related, some settings on the web based admin do not actually
update the defaults.cfg file.  Most notably the IP addresses to which
Xitami should bind (this setting usually used for customizing multi-homed
servers).  The only way to set that is to manually edit the defaults.cfg
file.  There may be other items in the web based admit that also don't
work.


Finally, my apologies if this was the wrong place to post.  Please forward
this email to the appropriate people if such is the case.
