# lists.xitami.org

This contains the list archives for the Xitami and Xitami-Dev mailing lists, archived
from Mailman.  It is a read-only archive.

The mailing lists were active from 2001 to 2011, and then archived in 2012.

To view these archives go to:

[https://imatix-legacy.github.io/lists.xitami.org/](https://imatix-legacy.github.io/lists.xitami.org/)

*Note*: not all the links will work, but the `gh-pages` version
has enough modifications that simple navigation to the list
archives, and through messages at the same level should work.
(In particular links to attachments which have a full `pipermail`
URL will not work; if needed the attachments can be found in the [Xitami
attachments](https://github.com/imatix-legacy/lists.xitami.org/tree/master/mailman/private/xitami/attachments)
and [Xitami-dev
atachments](https://github.com/imatix-legacy/lists.xitami.org/tree/master/mailman/private/xitami-dev/attachments)
directories, at the same relative URLs.
